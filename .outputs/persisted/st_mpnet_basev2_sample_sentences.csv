Gavin Newsom,"Well good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to quickly jump in and update everybody on this historic wildfire season here in the state of California. I put up this first graph in order to underscore the magnitude of the challenges we face so far this fire season in 2020, as a comparison to the challenges we faced in 2019. As you can see from this chart, just shy of 5,000 fires this time year to date in 2019, already over 7,500, in fact, 7,606 wildfires so far in 2020. But the number that has generated understandably more attention than any other is the next number, you see. 118,000 acres were burned in 2019 by this time last year. You can see close to, just shy of 2.3 million acres have been burned this year. Historic is a term we seemingly often use here in the state of California, but these numbers bear fruit to that assertion that this is historic.
This is the largest fire season we’ve had in terms of total acreage impacted in some time, back recorded in recent modern history, but nonetheless, you put it in comparison terms and contrast to last year. It’s rather extraordinary, the challenge that we faced, again, so far, this season 2020.
Since just, well, August 15th, just a few weeks back, we have had over 900 fires statewide, 25 major, what we refer to as fire complexes in the state of California and some 42,000 people still under evacuation orders. Just since 8/15, since August 15th, 1.8 million acres have burned. So again, the challenge has been made more acute just in the last few weeks since the middle of August, primarily, not exclusively, but primarily because of the unprecedented number of dry lightning strikes that the state of California experienced over primarily a 72 hour period, but ongoing dry lightning strikes that we experienced for a week extended.
So this is a challenging year. It’s historic in terms of magnitude, scope and consequence. And it also has required us a deep reservoir of resource. Nearly 14,000 firefighters currently deployed to work on these fires, over 1900 engines. Those include by the way, engines that have come out of state and engines and support that will come from the federal government. Tragically, we’ve lost eight lives so far this wildfire season, and we know of 3,400 structures that have been destroyed. We know that number is an under count as we repopulate areas, as the smoke quite literally settles and we’re able to go back and assess the damage based upon this historic wildfire season.
Let me give you an update on the progress on active wildfires over the course of the last number of weeks. Just a week or so ago, six days ago, I updated you on the Lake Napa complex of fires, some 375,000 acres. We were at 76% containment. Today we’re at 91% containment. The CZU fire down there, the Santa Cruz mountains, 46% contained last week. We’re now up to 81% containment. So progress on those two complexes of fires. Demonstrable example and proof point of the grit, the hard work, the determination of Cal Fire, our mutual aid system and our partners across the spectrum, be it those that are on the front lines from the California Conservation Corps to those that have come out of CDCR, our state penitentiary, working those lines and mitigating the spread and growth of those fires. The SCU fire is now substantially more contained than it was a week ago. 95% containment compared to where we were just six days ago at 76%.
Let me just though mark both on the LNU complex and the SCU complex, those two fires representing the second and third largest complex wildfires in state history. Because of the wind events, and I’m going to talk about that in a moment, those complexes are still spotting, meaning we’re still having issues around containment. And while you see extraordinarily high containment numbers, 91% on the LNU and 95% on the SCU, that’s not good enough. We still have work to do, particularly with these winds coming up. And so I say that to highlight a point of caution. Oftentimes when people see containment north of 50%, they take a deep breath and there’s a sense that we’ve got these things absolutely under control. We have substantially made progress. It’s demonstrable in those containment numbers, but with wind events that we’re experiencing currently and what we anticipate over the next coming days, we have to be mindful that even with high containment numbers, those fires are anything but behind us.
Accordingly, the August complex, now the fourth largest in the state’s history, 261,000 acres last week, 20% contained, has grown to 356,000 acres in the last six days and is only modestly improved in terms of the total containment, you see there at 24%. I want to just update you as well on what has occurred over the course of the last weekend, new active wildfires that have generated a lot of attention, understandably and appropriately. The Creek Fire in particular began in Fresno County. It’s now extended into Madera County. It’s primarily a federal fire, but there is a state overlay and component, and I want to extend appreciation for the FMAG, that’s language, many of you that follow these press conferences are familiar with, that was afforded the state of California over the weekend. I want to thank FEMA for that support and the White House for their support in this space. That is currently 0% contained and as of this morning was at 143,000 acres.
I want to just make this point. In a moment I’ll show you just a very brief video. We talk about grit. We talk about determination. We talk about people that are committed to their job, not just interested in their job. That was demonstrated by active real courage over the course of the weekend, where we had a Black Hawk helicopters and Chinook helicopter come in when the smoke was raving, meaning you couldn’t see very far, the visibility was problematic. We had 214 individuals that were rescued near Mammoth Pool, Shaver Lake area with these helicopters that made their way. And you could see on this video, some of the images of people that are coming off that Chinook helicopter. That was because of the bravery of our National Guards men and women. And I just want to personally express deep respect and admiration on behalf of 40 million Californians, but also behalf of 214 families whose lives were spared, including we estimate 11 pets that were also helped in this rescue.
There were night goggles used once those air tankers were no longer in the way at 7:00 PM at night in the midst of all of the density of smoke with a lack of visibility. With those night goggles, they were able to descend, find a safe place to land, and they made a decision, the right decision, to evacuate as many people as they did. I can assure you though, safety always is top of mind, that they stretched the limits of capacity in terms of the utilization of these evacuations protocols, as it relates to the helicopters themselves. And I think just deserve tremendous credit and of course our personal admiration here at the Office of Emergency Service for a job well done. So our training meets the moment, but always takes the courage, the conviction and the grit of real people doing real work. And so again, a deep gratitude to the men and women that were out there.
And by the way, they were out there again today, evacuating 150 people and another 14. So, over a 164 individuals were evacuated just this morning in similar efforts. We’ve got about 17 plus people that we’re still working to evacuate in real time. Information on that will be forthcoming quite literally momentarily over the course of the next few hours. So ongoing rescue efforts and extraordinary effort over the weekend, demonstrably exampled by those images you just saw and many other images that have been shared across this state and across this country.
Across this state, though, we continue to fight additional new active fires, Greek Fire being one of them. The Valley Fire now in San Diego, 3% contained, some 17,000 acres impacted so far. The El Dorado Fire in around San Bernardino County, 10% containment, 16,000 acres. So these are the new active fires that have come up over the course of the weekend, the El Dorado getting a lot of attention because it’s a reminder that the vast majority of fires that we experience on an annual basis come from individuals making bad decisions or by simple neglect and accident, meaning 90 plus percent of the fires that we experience in the state of California on an annual basis are manmade fires.
El Dorado though, there’s an investigation, those that may want to inquire more, all I can say is we are investigating the facts. A lot has been reported on this. We are investigating the veracity of what’s been reported, but moreover, we have an investigation that is underway. And when we are confident in the results of that investigation, we will make as quickly as possible that information public, but it appears to be at this moment, and I say appears to be at this moment, an example of another fire that was not mother nature, but manmade in this case.
The Bobcat Fire is another fire we are monitoring down in LA County, 0% containment, 8,500 acres. And the Oak Fire up around Mendocino, north of Hillsborough, 5% containment, a little less than 1000 acres. The reason I highlight these is we’re highlighting these in our early morning meetings, and I want you to be familiar with what my team is communicating to me directly as areas of real focus, areas of ongoing concern, as it relates to active wildfires in this state.
It is not lost on anybody, particularly those that had to weather the weather over the course of this long holiday weekend, that we experienced yet another massive record breaking heat wave over the last three days. Highest temperatures ever recorded, as an example, in Los Angeles County, 121 degrees. Death Valley, cool by historic standards. You recall Death Valley had 130 degree record historic, arguably world record temperature a few weeks back, but once again, topping north of 120 degrees, 122. Again, these temperatures felt all throughout the state of California, all throughout once again, the West Coast of the United States. And while things looked cooler in the Pacific Northwest, you still had a record breaking temperature-
… looked cooler in the Pacific Northwest. You still had record breaking temperatures in other parts of the West Coast of the United States as well, but California being impacted at a scale and scope that makes, again, this a very challenging time in our state’s history. Obviously, these weather events have put a lot of pressure on our energy supply, energy use. You may recall a few weeks back, I noted as it relates to some of the pressure that we were facing on our energy capacity, energy supply in our distribution system, that we averaged during the summer months about 38,000 megawatts of energy use at peak, 38,000. We went about 47,000 megawatts peak over the weekend. So we have put historic pressure on our grid. As you know, a few weeks back, we initiated an investigation. By the end of the month, we should have all of the results of that investigation, and real time information is coming back from the California Energy Commission, the California Independent System Operator, Cal ISO, and the California Public Utility Commission.
That’s the three legged stool of our energy supply and distribution here in the state of California, and they are working in partnership in a collaborative spirit to make sure that we never run as close as we are running to that peak capacity. Anywhere near 50,000 is a challenge for the state. Anywhere north of 45,000 puts enormous pressure. That pressure was placed on us over this weekend, so this was an active weekend in every way, shape, or form. But within that activity, your actions this weekend made a difference. We had advanced an emergency proclamation that helped us shift energy consumption. We worked with some of our largest IOUs. Those are our independent operators, utility operators, PG&amp;E, Edison, and others.
To look at shifting our peak hour usage, we put out information, PSAs, and other public pronouncements encouraging that consumption. You were able to shave, because of your actions, roughly 3000 megawatts. And that was the delta, that was the difference. And I just want to thank everybody that participated over this weekend in their active engagement, from the ports to the work that was done in terms of hydroelectricity. And all of this made more challenging, because of the wildfires impacted some of our energy generation in this state. So all these things are connected. This is a challenging time. But we’re up to this challenge, and we are committed and resolved not only to deal with this situationally, but to sustainably address these issues across the spectrum, from energy to the issues of wildfires. And I can assure you… I want to make this crystal clear. We are actively engaged in not only the moment, but actively engaged on medium and long-term solutions, fundamental solutions to address these extreme events that are now becoming almost normalized out here in the West Coast of the United States, impacting disproportionately the state of California.
I have no patience. And I say this lovingly, not as an ideologue, but as someone who prides himself on being open to argument, interested in evidence. But I quite literally have no patience for climate change deniers. It simply follows completely inconsistent, that point of view, with the reality on the ground, the facts as we are experiencing. You may not believe it intellectually, but your own eyes, your own own experiences, tell a different story, particularly out here in the West Coast of the United States and particularly here in the state of California. California leads in low carbon green growth. We will accelerate those efforts, but we’ll be mindful in that transition of making sure we do it effectively and reliably and safely with cost considerations always in mind. But nonetheless never, never have I felt more of a sense of obligation, sense of purpose, to continue to lead and maintain California’s status internationally, not just nationally, in terms of addressing the issue of climate change head on.
And so I just want folks to know that resolve is resonant with this administration, and I know with the California legislature. And we will continue to advance those efforts, recognizing that some of what we predicted, which people felt was extreme at the time, has now presented itself much earlier than even those extreme predictions. And that now requires us to look anew, forgive me, Abraham Lincoln, but to act anew in terms of our approach and our discipline in terms of addressing these challenges head on. Speaking of challenges that we have to address head on, we have now diablo wind events, very well known here in Northern California. Santa Ana wind events very well known and experienced in Southern California.
And of course, parts of Santa Barbara, these sundowner wind events all occurring in the last 24 hours. In the next 24 to 48 hours, we’ll see wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour. And so while we’ve averted these blackout issues, we obviously now have got to reintroduce our preventative mindset. And that’s why PG&amp;E, some of the largest independent system operators or rather independent utilities here in state of California, Edison included, have new protocols, new processes, new procedures, PSPS that now is impacted 23 counties in the state of California. And you see the 171,000 customers been impacted so far by PG&amp;E’s actions. Edison is looking potentially today, likely tomorrow, but potentially as early as today to impact customers in six counties. We have new COVID protocols as it relates to different strategies to work in partnership, not only with these utilities and their determination of safety shutoffs as a preventative measure to address their concerns around high winds and these very, very dry conditions and to mitigate the spread, mitigate the ignition of fires.
But we also have different protocols and partnerships with the counties on making sure those that are impacted have support. Many of those are in place. We’ll continue to monitor the success of that effort. We put tens of millions of dollars in the budget in anticipation of these PSPS protocols. We’re now utilizing those dollars, distributing those dollars, and making sure these centers are up and operational to protect the most vulnerable that are impacted by PSPS. Speaking of vulnerable and speaking about impact, here’s the update on our COVID case numbers in the state of California. The last reporting period, September 7th, you’ll see shy of 3000 new cases in the state, 2,676 to be exact. The 7-day rolling average now 4,302. If those appear to be more promising numbers, it’s because they are. Over the last 14-day period, we’ve averaged just shy of 114,000 tests over the last 7, excuse me, tests per day, about 110,000 yesterday. The test numbers are starting to come back up after the impacts of some of those larger fire complexes.
We now are running, over a 14-day period, 4.3% positivity rate. In fact, it’s dropped to 3.8% over a 7-day period. So 3.8% 7-day positivity rate in the state of California, 14-day positivity rate of 4.3%. Again, these are numbers in the aggregate statewide. Hospitalizations in the aggregate statewide have dropped 24% over the last 14 days, now 4% of total number of COVID patients represented in our hospitals’ beds system-wide. So 4% of those that are hospitalized in our entire system are COVID-19 positive patients. That is down substantially as well. Good progress in this space. Following that progress, ICU emissions are also trending downward, 21% decrease over the last 14-day period. And that represents 13% or so of all of the ICU patients in our system. So when you make progress in the aggregate and you get below 5% positivity rates, we’re now dropping below 4% on the seven day.
We are asked the question, understandably, what about more modifications on reopening the economy? As you recall, we put out recently new simplified metrics to determine how and when the state is allowed to move forward sectorally and regionally throughout the state of California. The foundational county movement is determined by simple metrics, including case rate and test positivity, total number of people that are tested, and that’s the percentage of people that test positive. Dr. Ghaly in a moment will come update you on that effort. And I just want to, before I introduce him, remind you that the blueprint for a safer opening is to simplify with four tiers. Four colors, the purple, red, orange, and yellow.
He will present where we are on the statewide approach, which is much more simple. Obviously extends more stringent considerations based upon our experience going back a number of months ago, but is framed with the chart that Dr. Ghaly will explain here as he also updates you, as he will start doing every Tuesday on the updated map of those that are in the purple, red, the moderate orange, and the minimal spread yellow in those maps. He’ll be presenting that update on those counties in just a few moments. With that, let me ask Dr. Ghaly to come up and walk you through some of these details.
Thank you, Dr. Ghaly. And so five counties now moving into different tiers. Just as a preview… And forgive me, Dr. Ghaly. We’re monitoring roughly seven additional counties that we anticipate will be moving over the course of the next week. So there’s a lot of activity in this space, a lot of progress that’s been made in the state of California getting that positivity rate down to 3.8%, but a point of caution, point of consideration. Three-day holiday weekends have not been advantageous in terms of the mitigation of the spread of-
… been advantageous in terms of the mitigation of the spread of this virus. You look back at some seminal periods where we experienced larger spread, a large surge of transmissions tended to occur two to three weeks after, say, 4th of July, other holiday weekends, and as a consequence, we are very cautious in terms of our approach as we move forward. We are going to hold the line in terms of the approach we laid out in partnership with counties up and down the state. This partnership continues. It’s an iterative process.
I’ll just give you an example. There are a number of counties that we are working with in real time over the course of the next few days, which we are comparing and contrasting certain data. It’s a way of expressing this. It’s dynamic. It is a process where we are doing all we can to be as responsive and inclusive as we should be under these circumstances, but progress being made as it relates to taming the spread and transmission of this virus, demonstrable in that seven and 14-day positivity rate and example here in the county tier status, where we have new counties moving forward into new tiers, which provide more activities and more opportunity to get us closer to normalcy.
Again, we cannot impress upon folks more the importance of wearing masks, physically distancing, washing hands, and minimizing mixing, but I would be remiss if I didn’t now just ask that we put up a video on the first bullet point around wearing a mask. We are blessed and we are privileged to have incredible philanthropic partners here in the state of California. One of them is Skoll Foundation. The Skoll Foundation reached out to us and committed to a partnership with Sesame Street, and as a consequence of those discussions, Sesame Street was willing to do a mask PSA in partnership with Skoll in our California For All Initiative. This PSA will be shared nationwide, and it features someone that’s very familiar to all of the children here in the state of California and the children inside of each and every one of us. We’ll queue up this new Sesame Street mask PSA.
So that’s the new PSA that’s coming out. I know it will at least fill one of my four kids’ heart as they will maybe pay attention to Elmo more than they will many of the adults and caregivers in this state, and so again, thank you to Jeff Skoll and the Skoll Foundation. Thank you to our partnership with Sesame Street, and thank you to our team, California For All. By the way, as always this PSA, the other ones that we presented you last week, the culturally competent PSAs we’re putting out as it relates to mixing a younger cohort, and we’re trying to reach, all of those PSAs and all the information we’ve provided here today, you can learn more about at covid19.ca.gov. Covid19.ca.gov.
I’ll close with this and then of course answer any questions by again just expressing my real debt of gratitude. On behalf of the state, I think our collective debt of gratitude to our firefighters that have been doing just a magnificent job under unprecedented historic challenges, and I just want to express, again, the partnerships’ collaboration that extend all across this country, as the mutual aid system is not just within the state of California. It extends throughout the state and around the rest of the world. We had 10 individual firefighters come from Israel last week. I had the privilege of talking to the prime minister of Canada about efforts they’re making to help support the state of California in terms of the mutual aid coming from Canada.
It’s just a remarkable moment that gives me a sense of optimism at a time when I know we’re filled with fear. So many of us with anxiety about the world or living in, this state, but people are remarkable, these moments and selfless and these moments. Again, that was exampled over the weekend in these heroic efforts, these two helicopters that landed rescuing 214 individuals in very difficult circumstances. They very easily, very easily could have turned around and said the smoke made that mission too dangerous, but they went in anyway. They saved many, many lives, and that’s just example of the kind of heroism that is a big part of this moment as well.
So progress with COVID-19, progress on the majority of these larger complex fires, new fires that are challenging us 800 miles apart from the northern part of this state to the southern part of the state. 10 plus thousand, 14,000 plus firefighters actively working on the scene partnerships with our federal forestry partners, as well as local partners actively working to suppress and mitigate the spread. But again, these weather conditions are challenging and these wind conditions in particular are going to make this next few days, most challenging perhaps we’ve had so far this year in terms of those suppression efforts. So again, just want to express deep gratitude for all of those on those front lines that are selfless in their sacrifice, in their heroism. With that, happy to answer any questions.
Well, we’re resilient. We’ll get through this. It’s not a permanent state. As I said, we’re not just dealing with these issues situationally and we are effectively doing so, and that’s because of the men and women in uniform that are on the front lines representing mutual aid from those states and from other countries that I just exampled. But we will get through this, and we are working in the medium and longterm to get to some of the root causes of the acuity, and that’s foundational in terms of the larger global issue of climate change, where California will continue to lead. In the absence of federal leadership, California will continue to lead, and we will be stepping up our efforts in that space, and we believe success leaves clues, and the more we push in this space, the more partners will be forthcoming in this space as well.
As it relates to the resource question, here’s the good news as relates to Colorado, you referenced. They have some weather conditions that are more favorable, some snow conditions that will loosen up resources. We have mutual aid requests out, and they are forthcoming because those assets are being made available from other states because of more favorable conditions in other parts of the West Coast of the United. So look, our mutual aid system is second to none in this country. We’re getting outpouring of support from around the world, and we’re developing a capacity of resiliency in this state that goes back decades. I mean, you can go back in the 80s and 90s, 2000s, 2010, 2020. Wildfires are a big part of the seasonal challenge in the state. The challenge we’re facing now is the extreme fire events that we believe are climate induced that require new approach and a different frame of tenacity.
And while we’ve substantially improved our investments particularly in the last year, the Brown Administration last year with an historic amount of resources we put in this space and new proactive vegetation management and forest management efforts that we advanced last year, and the new partnership, the new memorandum of understanding, a new 20-year commitment from the federal government to match those efforts for the first time. We recognize that’s one step in the right direction, but we’re going to need to make subsequent steps. So that’s what I would tell people. This is a resilient state. We have a remarkable capacity to meet these challenges head on, and we are committed not only to address the immediate but to address the medium and longterm by doing much more than we’ve done in the past, recognizing the enormity of challenge that we face.
Yeah, nothing fundamentally as it relates to our tiered status has changed. Quite the contrary. This is the interim process with 58 counties and health officers and the data that goes back and forth. In fact, this morning, we specifically had conversation with Marin, with Dr. Ghaly, and Dr. Ghaly’s right here, and he can eliminate you more specifically about exactly what the issue was on Friday versus today, Tuesday, with Marine County.
Next question. Thank you.
The new protocols were put into place pursuant to the work that we did last year with not only PG&amp;E and their efforts to get them out of bankruptcy and completely re-imagined as a company in terms of their focus on you, a consumer framework of public safety, reliability, and a sustainable mindset, but also with the other IOUs. Notably new protocols were established at the PUC on notification, 72-hour notification that has improved. Is it perfect? Not yet, but it has improved accordingly. It’s the second year we’ve been able to set aside money in our budget to improve our outreach and efforts to supplement the work that the IOUs are doing in partnership with the county, our office of emergency service and other NGOs as well as other partners, so there’s certainly been improvement in that space. The time and the total number of incidences has so far looked to have improved, meaning a year ago, I would have imagined more customers being impacted for a longer period of time. There’s more precision. There has been more communication, but we’re not where we’re going to be and not where we yet need to be.
We’re prioritizing addressing the immediate needs as it relates to those that have been evacuated, those that are potentially impacted by these wildfires, continuing our suppression efforts. We’re prioritizing the suppression, the mitigation, the spread of these wildfires and COVID. We continue to work actively. It’s a 24-hour day, so I try to stretch the days as much as I can. Weekends are an opportunity to work and to address issues as well as try to balance priorities, including some 400 bills that are on my desk that deal with a myriad of issues across the …
My desk that deal with a myriad of issues across the spectrum. Already working this afternoon on next year’s budget, all these things we’re capable of doing, we are doing, and that’s what we’re hired to do and so I’m very proud of the team. Incredible work here at the Office of Emergency Service which is best-in-class and so we continue to do our job, continue to recognize that we need to do better going forward to address some of these tectonic issues that have been in the making for years and years and years and we’re going to hit those solutions head-on as well. So we’re prioritizing immediate and I think you get a sense from these presentations what those top priorities are in terms of what we are advancing and announcing particularly in relation to COVID and our work to mitigate these wildfires.
Yeah, well I’m not an architect nor a historian but I have great admiration for architects and historians and I will defer to them. We already and we made this announcement when we were out there at our press conference, we’ve already received an outpouring of philanthropic inquiry and commitments of support to help rebuild those sites and so I’m humbled by that and I think all of us will be blessed by that largess and I have all the confidence in the world of our capacity to bring back some of those historic components and do our best to try to build memories for generations to come based upon the extraordinary contribution of those that designed and developed those sites in the first place.
As it relates to the issue of climate change, we are experiencing unprecedented confluence of issues this year that we did not experience last year, unprecedented record temperatures, a heat dome that impacted the entire West Coast of the United States, not just a few states on the West Coast. We are dealing with the reality of some 14,000 lightning strikes over a 72-hour period. Trust me, that did not occur last year, that had previously occurred in the late 1980s but when you add to the lightning strikes, the fact you have 150+ million dead trees related to a five plus year historic drought in the state of California, yes I conclude climate change profoundly has impacted the reality that we’re currently experiencing. It was a very different reality last year. Last year was actually a below-average fire season. This year again we’re dealing with challenges we haven’t seen in modern times, only analogous perhaps to the challenges we faced in 2018 under different circumstances but nonetheless we’ve already exceeded the total acreage burned so far and as every one of you have suggested, we’re just entering into fire season this year.
So the epidemiology, the data makes that determination by Dr. Ghaly is here to talk more specifically perhaps around that specific issue around salons and the distinction we place between the activities in a hair salon versus the activities in a nail salon.
We will make those determinations in realtime. Includes by the way conversations that are ongoing just as a reminder for theme parks, amusement parks, and the like. There are still many areas where we are open-ended in terms of our negotiation, making progress and advancing in the same space, getting closer to concluding when and how to safely reopen those sectors.
Yeah, I’m getting more information about the details of the event so I cannot opine about the nuance and details. Some report 12,000 people, you say 3,500, I heard as low as 2,500 from someone else so we’re in that process of gathering all those facts. As you know, our focus this weekend was a little bit different in terms of some emergency rescues and some efforts to deal with our energy supply as well as mitigate the spread of additional fires but we’re getting those details. I’m going to learn more about them this afternoon, getting a full report on what occurred over the weekend. Let me just say this though as a point of consideration. If you say you’re going to do something, do it.
If you get a permit to do something and you say you’re going to do the right thing, then you need to do the right thing, and you also, all of us, need to lead by example. If you’re going to request a permit, you’re going to put other people’s lives at risk. I think one has to do that with their eyes wide open very soberly and we all have to be I think cognizant of the reality, the spread of this disease. It does not help to have thousands and thousands of people not practicing physical distancing or social distancing, not wearing masks, in fact quite the contrary.
Quite literally someone can lose their lives and I know that’s not the intent of anyone that organizes these events, but it may be the outcome when you organize an event that grows larger than what you had asserted to be and those mitigations were not put into place and so I just want to express that as a foundational point in the spirit of your question and that includes any large, convening any large event, be it protest, be it organized, be it permitted, people must wear face coverings, people must practice the kind of social distancing that can mitigate the spread and transmission of this disease and it seems based upon at least the images that I’ve seen that that was not the case unfortunately with this event. More information will be presented to me and I know that you are the beneficiary among the many others of statements that the CHP has made in this space as well.
I think the latter part of your question was the answer to the first part of your question and as it relates to the issue of R0, I never talk R0, I have my doctor talk about R0 and so Dr. Ghaly will come up and talk specifically about that.
In the spirit of the question, let me just conclude by sharing another number that we did not share today and that was the number of lives lost, 32 lives were lost in this latest reporting period but that masks the number of lives that have been lost on an average daily basis, over 14 days, 107 lives lost on a daily basis on average over the last 14 days. It is another reminder of what Dr. Ghaly just said, how deadly this disease continues and remains to be and how the transmission continues and how incredibly important it is that when we are putting together events including events with one or two extended family members or neighbors or friends in our backyards that we do everything in our power to practice the physical distancing and the social distancing and to wear face coverings and masks which are the most important non-pharmaceutical interventions in slowing down the spread of this disease that we can advance and so I cannot impress upon people more, particularly coming out of Labor Day weekend, and the example of the large event that was demonstrable here at the State Capitol that we do everything in our power to rise up and elevate our capacity to lead by example and do what we can to extinguish the transmission and the spread of COVID-19.
So let me just thank all of you for the work you’ve done to get us to that 3.8% positivity rate, at least tracking over the last seven day period. Let me thank all those firefighters for extinguishing those wildfires, so many that have become household names and obviously the task that’s in front of us that’s self-evident in addressing the need to continue to be vigilant as we move deeper into this wildfire season. Take care everybody.
"
Bill Clinton,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: Tonight, I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union.
Let me begin by saluting the new Speaker of the House, and thanking him, especially tonight, for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the gallery with Mrs. Hastert: Lyn Gibson and Wenling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.
Mr. Speaker, at your swearing-in, you asked us all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that.
For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year. And now we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.
Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century. America is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to the Middle East.
Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a government for the information age. Once again, a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our oldest values of opportunity, responsibility, and community; devoted to fiscal responsibility; determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century; a 21st century government for 21st century America.
My fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that the state of our Union is strong.
Now, America is working again. The promise of our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today. So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century.
Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge, the aging of America. With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a senior boom. So first, and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century.
Early in this century, being old meant being poor. When President Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called ""the stark terror of penniless, helpless old age."" Even today, without Social Security, half our nation's elderly would be forced into poverty.
Today, Social Security is strong. But by 2013, payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments. By 2032, the Trust Fund will be exhausted and Social Security will be unable to pay the full benefits older Americans have been promised.
The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits, not to raise payroll tax rates, not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it. Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security.
Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the private sector, just as any private or state government pension would do. This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55 years.
But we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years. We should reduce poverty among elderly women, who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other seniors. And we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.
Now, these changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both Houses, in both parties, and ask that we join together in saying to the American people: We will save Social Security now.
Now, last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved. First things first.
But again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare Commission. If we work together, we can secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of seniors, affordable prescription drugs.
Third, we must help all Americans, from their first day on the job to save, to invest, to create wealth. From its beginning, Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions and savings. Yet, today, millions of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer than ever simply must save more than ever.
Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century. I propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal savings accounts -- USA accounts -- to give all Americans the means to save. With these new accounts Americans can invest as they choose and receive funds to match a portion of their savings, with extra help for those least able to save. USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our nation's wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to support them.
Fourth, we must invest in long-term care. I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled, and the families who care for them. Long-term care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of America, and we must do more to help our families deal with it.
I was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren. Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should take it.
So with these four measures -- saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting long-term care -- we can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors.
Now, there are more children from more diverse backgrounds in our public schools than at any time in our history. Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire Nation to thrive in the new economy.
Today we can say something we couldn't say six years ago: With tax credits and more affordable student loans, with more work-study grants and more Pell Grants, with education IRAs and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut that more than five million Americans will receive this year, we have finally opened the doors of college to all Americans.
With our support, nearly every state has set higher academic standards for public schools, and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students. With over $1 billion in discounts available this year, we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet.
Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the job.
You know, our children are doing better. SAT scores are up; math scores have risen in nearly all grades. But there's a problem. While our 4th graders outperform their peers in other countries in math and science, our 8th graders are around average, and our 12th graders rank near the bottom. We must do better. Now, each year the national government invests more than $15 billion in our public schools. I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work.
First, later this year, I will send to Congress a plan that, for the first time, holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. My ""Education Accountability Act"" will require every school district receiving federal help to take the following five steps.
First, all schools must end social promotion. No child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material. But we can't just hold students back because the system fails them. So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and after-school programs, to keep a million children learning.
Now, if you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics. Math and reading scores are up three years running with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods. It will work, and we should do it.
Second, all states and school districts must turn around their worst-performing schools or shut them down. That's the policy established in North Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt. North Carolina made the biggest gains in test scores in the nation last year. Our budget includes $200 million to help states turn around their own failing schools.
Third, all states and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers. The great majority of our teachers do a fine job. But in too many schools, teachers don't have college majors -- or even minors -- in the subjects they teach. New teachers should be required to pass performance exams, and all teachers should know the subjects they're teaching. This year's balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher standards.
And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments, I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner cities and isolated rural areas and in Indian communities. Let us bring excellence in every part of America.
Fourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices. In too many communities, it's easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools. Every school district should issue report cards on every school. And parents should be given more choices in selecting their public school.
Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we should say that all states and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policies.
Now, let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many schools are so old they're falling apart, or so overcrowded students are learning in trailers. Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that. This year, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5,000 schools.
If we do these things -- end social promotion; turn around failing schools; build modern ones; support qualified teachers; promote innovation, competition and discipline -- then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st century schools.
Now, we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work. The most basic tool of all is a decent income. So let's raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years. And let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws.
That was encouraging, you know.  There was more balance on the seesaw. I like that. Let's give them a hand. That's great. 
Working parents also need quality child care. So again this year, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families, for improved safety and quality, for expanded after-school programs. And our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay-at-home parents, too. They need support, as well.
Parents should never have to worry about choosing between their children and their work. Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the very first bill I signed into law, has now, since 1993, helped millions and millions of Americans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs. I think it's time, with all the evidence that it has been so little burdensome to employers, to extend family leave to 10 million more Americans working for smaller companies. And I hope you will support it.
Finally on the matter of work, parents should never have to face discrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children. That is not right.
America's families deserve the world's best medical care. Thanks to bipartisan federal support for medical research, we are now on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's, to arthritis to cancer. But as we continue our advances in medical science, we can't let our medical system lag behind. Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America, driving down costs but threatening to drive down quality as well.
I think we ought to say to every American: You should have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. If you need a specialist, you should have a right to see one. You have a right to the nearest emergency care if you're in an accident. These are things that we ought to say. And I think we ought to say: You should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment, whether it's a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment, or anything else. I believe this.
Now, I've ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health programs. But only Congress can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans. Now, last year, Congress missed that opportunity, and we must not miss that opportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to join together across party lines and pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.
As more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to all our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we can all say to the American people, ""We will protect the privacy of medical records, and we will do it this year.""
Now two years ago, the Congress extended health coverage to up to five million children. Now we should go beyond that. We should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance. We should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare. And we should continue to ensure access to family planning.
No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And therefore, I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation, proposed by Senators Kennedy and Jeffords, Roth, and Moynihan to allow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work.
We need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our university health centers to provide basic, affordable care for all the millions of working families who don't have any insurance. They do a lot of that today, but much more can be done. And my balanced budget makes a good down payment toward that goal. I hope you will think about them and support that provision.
Let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness. No American should ever be afraid -- ever -- to address this disease. This year, we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health. With sensitivity, commitment, and passion, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here, and I'd like to thank her for what she's done. Thank you.  Thank you.
As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes. Now, I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to protect our children from tobacco, and to hold tobacco companies accountable while protecting tobacco farmers.
Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare and other programs. You know, the states have been right about this: Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema, and other smoking-related illnesses; the tobacco companies should. So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and, with the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare.
Now, if we act in these areas -- minimum wage, family leave, child care, health care, the safety of our children -- then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for the 21st century.
Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating economy in history. But we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that embraces all Americans.
Today's income gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, the Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need. And I applaud all of you here who were part of that. This year, I recommend a five-year commitment to the new system so that we can provide, over the next five years, appropriate training opportunities for all Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when businesses close. I hope you will support this.
Also, I ask your support for a dramatic increase in federal support for adult literacy, to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a fifth grade level. We need to do this.
Here's some good news: In the past six years, we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half. You can all be proud of that. Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people. And our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it.
We must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American communities, with more support for community development banks, for empowerment zones, for 100,000 more vouchers for affordable housing. And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up to $15 billion in private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunities to our inner cities and rural areas with tax credits, loan guarantees, including the new ""American Private Investment Company,"" modeled on the Overseas Private Investment Company.
For years and years and years, we've had this OPIC, this Overseas Private Investment Corporation, because we knew we had untapped markets overseas. But our greatest untapped markets are not overseas; they are right here at home. And we should go after them.
We must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm. As this Congress knows very well, dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farms. Last year, the Congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture. And I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance. I ask you to join with me and do this. This should not be a political issue. Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in rural America today, and we need an appropriate means to address it.
We must strengthen our lead in technology. It was government investment that led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28-percent increase in long-term computing research. We also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment, by solving the so-called Y2K computer problem.
We had one member of Congress stand up and applaud.  And we may have about that ratio out there applauding at home, in front of their television sets. But remember, this is a big, big problem. And we've been working hard on it. Already, we've made sure that the Social Security checks will come on time. But I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every state and local government, every business, large and small, to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.
For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad. You know, until recently, a third of our economic growth came from exports. But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk. Today, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard. This is the most serious financial crisis in half a century. To meet it, the United States and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund. And while the turmoil is not over, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it.
At the same time, we have to continue to work on the long-term project, building a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so much of Asia. This June I will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose, and I ask all of you to support our endeavors.
I also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century America. I'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this chamber in both parties. I think trade has divided us, and divided Americans outside this chamber, for too long. Somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and workers and environmentalists and farmers and government can stand together. I believe these are the things we ought to all agree on. So let me try.
First, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets, and expand trade. But at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries actually benefit from trade, a trade that promotes the dignity of work and the rights of workers and protects the environment. We must insist that international trade organizations be more open to public scrutiny, instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism.
When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is becoming more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century doing here at home. We have got to put a human face on the global economy.
We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our nation. I have already informed the government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America will respond.
We must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly $2 billion. I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade, based on these principles. And I ask the Congress again to join me in this common approach and to give the President the trade authority long used and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.
Tonight I issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United States in a new round of global trade negotiations to expand exports of services, manufactures, and farm products. Tonight I say we will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world. And this year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world.
If we do these things -- invest in our people, our communities, our technology, and lead in the global economy -- then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America.
You know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful, more secure, more free. All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in Northern Ireland. All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace. And with our NATO allies, we are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice, and to give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve.
All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel. Now I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement the Wye agreement to protect Israel's security, to stimulate the Palestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan. We must not -- we dare not -- let them down. I hope you will help.
As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations and terrorism. We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of terror. The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world. So let's give them the support they need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources they must have so America can continue to lead.
We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks. We must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergenices, to support research into vaccines and treatments.
We must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from Korea to India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands. Our balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost two-thirds over the next five years.
With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals. The START II treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their cold war height.
It's been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the treaty now, to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms, and to make sure we can end nuclear testing forever.
For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them. America will continue to contain Saddam, and we will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people.
Now, last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb. Their mission was so flawlessly executed that we risk taking for granted the bravery and the skill it required. Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10-year veteran of the Air Force, flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine. He's here with us tonight. I'd like to ask you to honor him and all the 33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox.
Captain Taliaferro. 
It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985. Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our military readiness. My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next six years for readiness, for modernization, and for pay and benefits for our troops and their families.
We are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every community in America by millions of our veterans. America's defenders today still stand ready at a moment's notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can. They always come through for America. We must come through for them.
The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security. The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U. N. I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts.
We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia, expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China.
In China, last year, I said to the leaders and the people what I'd like to say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty. But I'd also like to say again to the American people: It's important not to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China.
Last spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw democracy and reform rising but still held back by violence and disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching Radio Democracy for Africa, supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the ""African Trade and Development Act.""
We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean, our common work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy and increase trade. In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely chosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the blessings of liberty.
The American people have opened their hearts and their arms to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated by the recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, I am committed to help them rebuild. When the First Lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands of our troops and thousands of American volunteers. In the Dominican Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominicans and Americans, working side-by-side. With her was someone else who has been very important to the relief efforts.
You know, sports records are made and, sooner or later, they're broken. But making other people's lives better, and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood -- that lasts forever. So, for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in two countries tonight.  Thank you.
So I say to all of you, if we do these things -- if we pursue peace, fight terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances -- we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world.
As the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must make them safer, more livable, and more united. This year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget. The Brady bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns. And now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years.
Tonight I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer. Our balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in the areas hardest hit by crime and then to equip them with new tools, from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots.
We must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime. Our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment, saying to prisoners: If you stay on drugs, you have to stay behind bars; and to those on parole: If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free of drugs.
I ask Congress to restore the five-day waiting period for buying a handgun and extend the Brady bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun.
We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities. Last year, every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We were deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the hands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents don't have to live through their loss.
After she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, came here to the White House with a powerful plea. She said, ""Please, please, for the sake of your children, lock up your guns. Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town."" It's a message she is passionately advocating every day. Suzann is here with us tonight, with the First Lady. I'd like to thank her for her courage and her commitment.  Thank you.
In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act, to pass legislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to keep our children safe.
A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt defined our ""great, central task"" as ""leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us."" Today, we're restoring the Florida Everglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red rock canyons of Utah, protecting California's redwoods and our precious coasts. But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming; 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat waves, floods, and storms are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we do not act now.
Tonight I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce greenhouse and other pollution, and tax incentives and investments to spur clean energy technology. And I want to work with members of Congress in both parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases.
All our communities face a preservation challenge, as they grow and green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day. In response, I propose two major initiatives: First, a $1 billion livability agenda to help communities save open space, ease traffic congestion, and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life; and second, a $1 billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of natural beauty all across America from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park.
These are truly landmark initiatives, which could not have been developed without the visionary leadership of the Vice President, and I want to thank him very much for his commitment here.
Now, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something back. That's why we created AmeriCorps, our national service program that gives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college.
So far, in just four years, 100,000 young Americans have built low-income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped to tutor children with churches, worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters, and performed countless other acts of service that have made America better. I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in AmeriCorps.
Since 1997, our initiative on race has sought to bridge the divides between and among our people. In its report last fall, the initiative's advisory board found that Americans really do want to bring our people together across racial lines.
We know it's been a long journey. For some, it goes back to before the beginning of our Republic; for others, back since the Civil War; for others, throughout the 20th century. But for most of us alive today, in a very real sense, this journey began 43 years ago, when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up. She's sitting down with the First Lady tonight, and she may get up or not, as she chooses. We thank her.  Thank you, Rosa.
We know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as the Presidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps. The initiative I've outlined tonight will help to close them. But we know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either. Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong, and it ought to be illegal. Therefore, I ask Congress to make the ""Employment Non-Discrimination Act"" and the ""Hate Crimes Prevention Act"" the law of the land.
Now, since every person in America counts, every American ought to be counted. We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do that.
Our new immigrants must be part of our One America. After all, they're revitalizing our cities; they're energizing our culture; they're building up our economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life. That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of government. There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that. Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet their responsibility. I hope you will support it.
Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America.
You know, barely more than 300 days from now, we will cross that bridge into the new millennium. This is a moment, as the First Lady has said, ""to honor the past and imagine the future.""
I'd like to take just a minute to honor her. For leading our Millennium Project, for all she's done for our children, for all she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best ideals at home and abroad, I honor her. 
Last year, I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary has traveled all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas Edison's invention factory or Harriet Tubman's home. Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community. And tonight, before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community to become a nationally recognized ""millennium community,"" by launching projects that save our history, promote our arts and humanities, prepare our children for the 21st century.
Already, the response has been remarkable. And I want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to members in Congress of both parties for their support. Just one example: Because of you, the Star-Spangled Banner will be preserved for the ages. In ways large and small, as we look to the millennium we are keeping alive what George Washington called ""the sacred fire of liberty.""
Six years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us. But across this country, in a thousand neighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character of America. I knew then that we Americans could renew this country.
Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Address of the 20th century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that ""more perfect Union"" of our Founders' dream.
We're now at the end of a century when generation after generation of Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming depression, lifting up the disposed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice, building the largest middle class in history, winning two World Wars and the long twilight struggle of the Cold War. We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievement of our forebears in this century. Yet, perhaps, in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we don't see our own time for what it truly is, a new dawn for America.
A hundred years from tonight, another American President will stand in this place and report on the state of the Union. He -- or she -- he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now. So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time but of their time, that we reached as high as our ideals, that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness, that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.
My fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as one nation, and from the mountaintop of this American Century, look ahead to the next one, asking God's blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved country.
Thank you, and good evening.
"
Norman Fowler,"I will with permission, Mr. Speaker, make a statement on the review of social security.
During the last 18 months the Government have been examining the major areas of social security provision. In that time more than 40,000 consultation documents were issued, 4,500 pieces of evidence were received, and 62 organisations and individuals gave oral evidence at public sessions. The Government are today publishing a Green Paper which sets out their proposals. We will now be seeking comments on the proposals from interested organisations and will be providing an opportunity for the House to debate them.
The social security system in the United Kingdom owes a great deal to the report of Sir William Beveridge in 1942. Although much of what he proposed was changed when it came to implementation, and more has been changed since, many of the principles on which his proposals were founded remain sound. The Government remain committed to the concept of a national insurance system, under which entitlement to the major benefits is earned by the payment of contributions during a working life. The Government also believe that our tradition of state support for those in need is one which should be maintained and developed. However, social security is not a function of the state alone. It should be a partnership between the individual and the state—a system built on twin pillars.
Any review of social security must recognise its considerable achievements, but the review has shown that there are several major causes for concern. By common consent the social security system is too complex. That is to the disadvantage of both the public and the staff. In particular, the research evidence shows that substantial numbers of supplementary benefit claimants do not understand how their entitlement is worked out, in spite of the fact that 38,000 staff are now working exclusively on supplementary benefit. With the pressures now being faced there is a danger that some parts of the system will break down. It is, therefore, a matter of urgency that we devise a simpler and more coherent system.
The social security system also needs to be modernised. It is not properly co-ordinated with the tax system and operates with outdated equipment. We now need a major computerisation strategy for social security, which can link effectively with other Government systems, including that of the Inland Revenue.
To make better provision to meet the needs of poor working families with children has been a major priority of the review. We therefore propose to introduce a new benefit, to be called family credit, to provide better help for such families. Family income supplement will be abolished. Family credit will have three main features. First, it will be paid on the same basis as help to unemployed families, in that help will be related to the age of children. That means that families with children cannot generally be better off out of work than in work.
Secondly, family credit will be related to take-home pay, not to gross earnings, as is family income supplement. The worst effects of the poverty trap will be eliminated by making it impossible for people to face a marginal tax rate of more than 100 per cent. Thirdly, it will be paid by employers through the pay packet. Families will see their benefit as part of their income from work, whether as an offset to tax and national insurance, or, in the case of the lowest paid, as an addition to gross pay.
Family credit will be paid in addition to child benefit. The Government believe that the extra responsibilities carried by all those bringing up children should be recognised. Child benefit will, therefore, continue to be paid for all children, irrespective of the means of the family.
Family credit will be part of a coherent system of income-related benefits. That system, covering basic income support, assistance with housing costs and help for low income families, will be based on a common income test and a common structure. It will be simpler, fairer and easier to administer, and it will provide the same level of help at the same level of income for those in and out of work.
We propose to replace supplementary benefit with a new income support system. The central concept of the income support scheme is that the regular extra payments, now made on the basis of detailed individual assessment, should be absorbed into the main rates of benefit. Those rates will provide a special higher level of benefit for pensioners, the long-term sick and disabled and lone parents. Families with children will not only receive assistance for each child, but a premium to reflect the extra pressures that they must cope with. At the same time, the capital rule will be eased by introducing a taper between £3,000 and £6,000, instead of the present inflexible £3,000 cut-off. We shall also ease the earnings rule for the long-term unemployed and the disabled.
The income support scheme should provide for the needs of almost all claimants, but we recognise that the system must be ready to cope flexibly and quickly with particular problems. Instead of the present single payments system, we propose to set up a social fund which will be operated on a discretionary basis by specially trained staff at Department of Health and Social Security local offices. It will provide emergency help where needed, and help those who face particular difficulties. We also expect that ​ the social fund will, in time, provide a better basis for contributing cash help to enable people to be cared for in the community rather than in institutions.
Today I am also publishing the report of the housing benefit review team, and have accepted most of its recommendations. The review team found that housing benefit was excessively complicated, involving six different tapers applied to different groups at different income levels. It is also expensive and poorly targeted, with more than one third of all households, some with incomes up to average earnings, receiving benefit.
We intend to move to a simpler and clearer system. It will be based on the same net income assessment basis as the income support and family credit systems. It will also provide help on the basis of rent and rates together rather than separately, as at present.
For the poorest families, housing benefit will meet 100 per cent. of rent. At present 100 per cent. help goes only to those on supplementary benefit. In future, it will apply equally to those in and out of work.
We believe, however, that the basis on which help is provided with rates needs to be changed. At present some 7 million householders receive help with some or all of their rate bills and over 3 million householders pay no rates. As a result, a large proportion of people live in households in which no rates are paid. This means that there is no effective link between payment for and use of local services. The whole structure of rates is currently under review, but the Government believe that, so long as domestic rates remain, all householders should be directly responsible for making some payment towards them. The Government have in mind a figure of the order of 20 per cent.
The review also examined the contributory national insurance benefits for unemployment, maternity and widowhood. As I have already made clear, the Government remain committed to the principle of basic provision for these contingencies organised by the state through the national insurance system. We propose no change in unemployment benefit, which will continue to be paid for 12 months.
For widows under 60, we propose to replace the widow’s allowance currently payable for the first six months after bereavement by a single lump sum payment of £1,000 to give them more help when it is most needed. In addition, widowed mother’s allowance will now be paid from the time of bereavement rather than after six months as at present. Widow’s pension will also be paid from the time of bereavement, but the rules of eligibility will be modified to concentrate help more on older widows who are least likely to be able to resume work. The changes will not affect the benefit paid to any existing widows.
In maternity, we propose to adjust the rules governing maternity allowance so that the mother can have greater freedom in choosing when, around the time of her confinement, she wishes to be paid the allowance. We also intend to change the qualification period so that the benefit is more likely to be paid to women who have had to give up work in order to have their babies.
The maternity grant and the death grant have been left at their present level—£25 and £30 respectively—for many years and are now quite inadequate for their purpose. The average cost of a funeral is now over 10 times as much as the death grant, and it costs £20 in administration to pay out each £30 grant.
We propose instead a new maternity grant of £75—three times the level of the present grant ​ —available to all low income families. Help with the full cost of funerals will also be made available more widely than at present to anybody who has responsibility for a funeral and lacks the resources to pay for it. Help will be provided through the social fund to ensure that it can be given quickly and flexibly and with the minimum of detailed inquiry. These changes will concentrate help where and when it is most needed instead of providing a token contribution to everybody when it may be of little practical use.
As a country we cannot ignore these emerging costs. If the best estimates available to us lead us to question whether we will be able to afford the promises we are making, we have a duty to re-examine the position. It would be an abdication of responsibility to hand down obligations to our children which we believe they cannot fulfil.
All rights built up in the state scheme at the time of the change will be honoured. In addition, we also intend to give a special enhancement of rights for men aged between 40 and 49 and women aged 35 to 44. They will be given a bonus of added years of entitlement, which will give them higher pensions when they eventually retire.
For those to be covered by the new arrangements the Government will lay down a minimum contribution level of 4 per cent. of earnings, at least half of which must be provided by the employer. The new arrangements will be phased in over three years. These changes will mean that in due course all employees will be contributing to their own additional pension through their jobs. This will represent the biggest ever extension of occupational pension coverage in this country and will add to the reforms of occupational pensions, involving improved rights for early leavers and transfer of pensions, currently in legislation before Parliament.
The Government must also ensure that the social security system is managed as effectively as possible to provide the best possible service to the public. The Government’s benefit proposals will in themselves make the system simpler, but we are now to embark on the largest programme of computerisation ever undertaken in this country to modernise and improve its operation.
The benefit changes and the computerisation both of my Department and the Inland Revenue will provide opportunities to achieve better co-operation and closer working between the tax and benefit systems. The Government intend to take advantage of those opportunities and will be considering this further in the context of the Green Paper on personal taxation.
Meanwhile, we have decided to take a major step towards better harmonisation by aligning the tax and benefit years. Instead of benefits being uprated in November each year, the uprating date will be moved to April. This means that all tax and benefit changes will be implemented at the same time. It will also be of considerable assistance to local authorities which at present have to reassess housing benefit cases twice a year.
The change in the benefit year will be brought in at the time of implementation of the major structural reforms. We expect this to be in April 1987. After the uprating of benefits due at the end of November 1985, there will, therefore, be a 16-month period before the change in April 1987. It would clearly be wrong to allow such a gap between upratings, but it would not be practicable to have upratings both in November 1986 and April 1987. Accordingly, the Government have decided that, following the November 1985 uprating, there will be two upratings at eight-month intervals, the first in July 1986 and the second in April 1987.
The programme of reform that I have announced will provide a system which is easier to understand and simpler to administer. It will mean the most substantial changes in income-related support for 50 years, and for the first time give equal support for those in and out of work. It will ​ provide more help for low income families with children.It will establish a better partnership between state and individual provision, especially in pensions, giving everyone the right to his own pension with his job. Above all, the reforms will provide a modern social security system to take us into the next century.
"
Jeremy Hunt,"This government is completely committed to the values of the NHS – the same values that encourage aspiring doctors to take up a career in medicine.
Junior doctors are the backbone of the NHS, but the current contract has failed to prevent some working unsafe hours, and doesn’t reward them fairly. We know also that they feel unsupported because consultants and diagnostic services are not always available in the evenings and at weekends.
Today a firm offer for a new contract has been published by NHS Employers. The new contract will be fairer for doctors, safer for patients and juniors alike, better for training, and will better support a 7-day NHS.
The proposals offer an 11% increase to basic pay, with further increases linked to progressing through training and taking on roles with greater responsibility –instead of being based on time served.
Our ambition for the NHS to be the safest healthcare system in the world is underpinned by reducing, not increasing, the number of hours junior doctors work each week. Juniors will be supported by improved contractual safeguards – the best protection junior doctors have ever had against working long, intense and unsafe hours. For example, no junior will be required to work more than a weekly average of 48 hours without consent and those who opt out of that legal limit in the European Working Time Directive will not be able to work more than a weekly average of 56 hours. The number of hours that can be worked in any single week by any junior will be limited to 72, down from 91; there will be a 13 hour limit on shifts; and there will be no more than 5 consecutive long days or 4 consecutive nights, compared to the current contract which permits 7 consecutive night shifts or up to 12 consecutive day shifts.
Putting patients first is the responsibility of employers and staff. We would expect Trust Boards to look at any such report and decide how to respond to it; and we would expect the CQC, when it carries out an inspection, to look at how the Board has responded to this and other data reporting safety incidents and concerns – a tough new measure to ensure safe working.
In order to better support a 7-day NHS, basic pay will increase by 11% to compensate for an extension in plain time working on Saturdays during the day and on weekday evenings, and there will be an enhanced rates for hours worked at nights, on Saturday evenings and Sunday.
The government has also decided that plain time will be extended only to 7pm on Saturdays – instead of 10pm on Saturdays – and wants to improve training and ensure better clinical supervision from consultants as well.
We will offer new flexible pay premia for those training in hard-to-fill training programmes where there is the most need – such as general practice, emergency medicine and psychiatry – and we will protect the salaries of those who return or switch to training in these programmes.
Junior doctors who take time off for academic research that is part of their NHS training, or which contributes to the wider NHS and improvements in patient care, will get additional pay premia to make sure they don’t lose out.
Today, I have also written to all junior doctors in England confirming that no junior doctor working legal hours will receive a pay cut compared to their current contract during transition. Around three quarters will see an increase in pay and the rest will be protected.
The exception to this is those who currently receive up to a 100% salary boost as compensation for working unsafe hours. Instead, new contractual safeguards will ensure they are not required to work unsafe hours at all.
To see how the offer affects them, junior doctors can now log on to a pay calculator published by NHS Employers where they can calculate projected take home pay.
Our preference throughout has been, and continues to be, to reach agreement through negotiations. We have maintained that, in reforming the contract, we must put patients right at the heart of everything the NHS does every day of the week. A fair, sustainable contract with stronger safeguards, together with the greater availability of consultants at the weekends and evenings, is good for patients and good for junior doctors.
The details published today represent the government’s offer in England, which will be for doctors and dentists in postgraduate training programmes overseen by Health Education England.
Since they withdrew from negotiations in October 2014 – despite agreeing the need for change as far back as 2008 – the BMA have refused to return to the table. In light of today’s announcement we hope that the BMA will now agree to return to negotiations.
"
Chuka Umunna,"Conference, it is an honour and a pleasure to be addressing you as a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament and as your Shadow Foreign Secretary.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for making me feel so welcome. I could not be more at home in the wonderful Liberal Democrat family.
The truth is, all the incredibly difficult decisions I have made on the journey I’ve been on this year were routed in my values and principles. I joined this party out of conviction.
As you know, I am a Remainer and proud of it – we have spent far too long apologising for being pro-European in this country. Because you cannot be pro-Britain and put our national interest first without seeking to put Britain at the heart of Europe.
Be in no doubt: this is the battle of our time and it goes far beyond Britain’s borders.
In essence, the society we seek to build is one where if you work hard and play by the rules, you should be free to lead a happy, prosperous and secure life free of domination of either the state or the market.
I grew up in world in which we took these values for granted.
As a family of mixed heritage – English, Irish and Nigerian – our back story, alongside that of millions of others, stands as an example of Britain’s liberal, open, internationalist spirit.
The notion that we all share the same basic rights and should live together in peace, regardless of background is something we will always fight for.
This is the Britain we know and love – and Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and the peddlers of hate and division in our country better know that this is what we will fight for at the coming election.
It is our job to make sure this country’s heart beats in a liberal and internationalist direction; not nationalist, populist authoritarianism.
This is the new fault line in British politics and we know where we stand.
Because we recognise that these things cannot be achieved in isolation and that the pursuit of individual and social justice does not stop at the border, we seek to work together with other liberal democracies who share our values to overcome cross border obstacles to achieving our goals.
That is why we are internationalists. That is why we are pro-European. Liberalism is needed at home to protect personal freedom and liberty; Liberalism and cooperation are also needed abroad to secure peace, promote democracy and defend human rights.
Of course, the first thing we will do in Government is revoke Article 50 so that, once again, the British people can resume their role of providing leadership as a full and active member of the European Union.
This order is imperfect. It must do far better at reducing inequality and fostering a more inclusive global economic system. But however flawed it may be, this liberal international order has none the less created peace and prosperity.
The trade it has opened up between countries helped ensure global competition no longer resulted in military conflict. In turn, this has helped lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and people are more healthy than before.
Furthermore, the liberal democracies that fall within the order have, in the main, also provided better protection of the rights and civil liberties of their peoples.
And it has forced Extreme nationalism retreat.
Yet the advances made then are now at risk.
Today it is that liberal international order that is now in retreat. As a result the world is becoming a more dangerous place.
Across the world, nationalist populism – the pernicious mantra that nations should be homogeneous and one people is superior to another – is making strides.
Let us be clear: the Liberal Democrats are the only party that can get into office which is capable of meeting this challenge in Britain today.
You see, you cannot defend a liberal, rules based order abroad if you so openly flout the rules at home.
Boris Johnson has facilitated the takeover of Her Majesty’s Government by the remnants of Vote Leave campaign – an outfit that was not only was found guilty of lying during the 2016 referendum in relation to its claims on the NHS by the Statistics Authority, but it was found guilty of cheating and breaking the law by the Electoral Commission.
Now, as he seeks to force through a catastrophic “no deal” Brexit, the Prime Minister has shut down Parliament and is threatening to break the law if necessary.
And, as he seeks to force the UK out of the EU, he will become ever reliant on President Trump, whose political playbook he follows. But President Trump has always been clear – it will be America not Britain First.
This brings me to the Opposition. The Labour Party likes to think of itself as a champion of liberal values at home and abroad.
You cannot be a champion of liberalism if you are currently subject to a formal investigation by the Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission for institutional racism against Jewish people.
You cannot be a champion of liberalism when your leader’s supporters think it is acceptable to abuse, vilify and deselect anyone who dares to question the leader.
And you cannot claim to be liberal when the political editor of the BBC needs to take a bodyguard to your conference.
Of course what unites both Johnson and Corbyn is the fact that they want to leave the EU, the organisation which has been the biggest champion of liberalism in our part of the global neighbourhood. Neither is fit to lead this country.
Its time for a change and someone who I know can provide that leadership: Jo Swinson.
Under Jo’s premiership we can breathe a progressive breath of fresh air into the British foreign policy.
Liberal Democrats are internationalists. This is at the heart of who we are as a party, it flows through everything we do.
We believe in tearing down walls, not building them. We believe in working together through multilateral organisations, not standing alone.
With Jo as our Prime Minister we will revive our reputation on the world stage and get on with helping to improve the lives of those across the world.
As Liberal Democrats we have a duty to do this, to defend the values of human rights, democracy, and equality.
And as your Liberal Democrat Shadow Foreign Secretary I can promise you that I will stand up for a truly global Britain.
Thank you.
"
Liam Fox,"Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be back in Washington.
I would like to thank our hosts, the Heritage Foundation, for inviting me to address such a distinguished gathering, on a topic that is not only close to my heart professionally, but more politically relevant than at any time in the past thirty years.
In my first speech as Secretary of State for International Trade I set out the case for an open and liberal trading environment.
That speech was in Manchester in the North of England – home of the Industrial Revolution, and a city with iconic associations to free trade.
That was nearly was two years ago when trade barely registered on the radar for most of our media. How different things are today when trade is front and centre of the international political debate . The disputes between the US and China, around NAFTA, steel and aluminium tariffs, and the UK’s future trade agreement with the European Union are the most talked about issues of the day.
It is therefore a good time for us to examine both our attitudes to trade from first principles and to measure them against our domestic priorities and international obligations.
It was just over 240 years ago, on 9 March 1776 that Adam Smith published the Wealth of Nations.
It set out the principles for the emerging world of global commerce at the end of the eighteenth century with a vision of what trade could produce in terms of prosperity and opportunity.
He countered the dominant mercantilist viewpoint – revolutionary in its time – and the case he set out is just as relevant today.
Indeed, he reminds us still, that the essential element of a successful trading system is mutual benefit.
David Ricardo took these principles of free trade forward when, in 1817, he published the theory of comparative advantage.
Building on Smith a generation before, Ricardo described the economic reality of the gains from trade and demonstrated how free and open trade is profitable to all.
It is one of the most powerful concepts in economics, described by the economist Paul Samuelson as the only proposition in all the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial. It remains, to this day, the most fundamental justification of the power of free trade.
Now of course, since those days, since 1817, the world has changed beyond all recognition, yet the experiences of globalisation, and of technological advances unimaginable in Ricardo’s time, have only served to validate his theory.
The principles of free and open trade have underpinned the multilateral institutions, rules and alliances that helped rebuild post-war Europe and the world beyond.
They helped usher the fall of communism and the tearing down of the Iron Curtain; they facilitated 70 years of global prosperity, and they have raised the living standards of hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings across the world.
Indeed free trade has allowed us to take 1 billion of our fellow human beings out of abject poverty in just one generation – one of the great achievements in history.
Just as predicted in the early theorising by Smith, Ricardo and others, time and time again we find a strong positive correlation between economic openness and growth.
During the 1990’s, per capita income grew three times faster in the developing countries that lowered trade barriers than in those that did not.
That effect is not confined to the developing countries, either. The OECD Growth Project found that a 10 percentage-point increase in trade exposure was associated with a 4 per cent rise in income per capita. Free trade works.
Globally, as free trade has blossomed, poverty levels have fallen to their lowest in history: bringing industry, jobs and wealth where once there was only deprivation.
Trade liberalisation gives consumers greater choice, and the competition it unleashes brings higher quality and standards at lower prices for everything from food and drink to toys and cars. Free trade provides developing countries with the opportunity to embrace the international trading system, to integrate into global value chains, and ultimately to grow their economies.
But the effects of free and open trade go further than simple economics. This is particularly true in the era of globalisation and will become even more so in the future. I have already mentioned the fact that free trade has already allowed us to take 1 billion of our fellow human beings out of abject poverty.
But trade is not an end in itself. It is a means to spread prosperity. That prosperity underpins social cohesion. That social cohesion in turn underpins political stability, and that political stability is the building block of our collective security. It is a continuum that cannot be interrupted without consequence. If prosperity is denied to those who aspire to it – and free trade is a key enabler of this – we should not be surprised if the result is further mass migration across the globe or indeed political radicalisation.
Those of us, the world’s richest countries, who have done well from a global free trade system cannot simply say ‘we’ve done okay’ and pull the drawbridge up behind us without having to pay a price.
There are many arguments in the worlds of politics and economics that will never be settled – just as well for the politicians and journalists here today – and are as much a matter of interpretation as they are objective data.
But the effect of protectionism is as close to settled science as anything in economics will ever be: it means reduced productivity gains and lost economic growth. Long run historical trends suggest that a 20 per cent reduction in trade holds back productivity by around 5 per cent.
And worse, in a world of globalisation where interdependency is increasing and where disruptions in one part of the world can quickly ricochet around the rest, our ability to act unilaterally with impunity is diminishing by the day. The 2008 financial crisis was just the latest example of how economic earthquake in one part of the globe can soon be the financial tsunami for the rest.
We, today, are at an important juncture in the history of free and open trade, and of the established international order.
In many ways, the picture is actually a positive one. After several years of relative stagnation, the growth in global trade is once again outpacing the rise in global GDP with trade predicted to grow by 4.5 per cent this year with GDP growing by 3.8 per cent.
The global economy continues to rebound from the dark days of the financial crash and ensuing recession experienced by many large economies.
Yet it is also a reflection of how globalisation and new technology continue to facilitate trade, and the irrepressible growth of the digital and knowledge economies – sectors which hardly existed even two decades ago.
And this is perhaps the root of our current paradox which is this: we have seen the benefits of free trade at home and abroad. We are seeing a rise in living standards and a reduction in global poverty. We are witnessing our innovative industries achieve global dominance.
Who, 20 years ago, could ever have imagined the global impact of Google, of Facebook or of Amazon? Who would have believed how cheaply we could access the newest electronic gadgets from mobile phones with more computer capacity than the Apollo programme, or the latest high definition TVs at seemingly evermore affordable prices?
Yet, even with all this evidence of the success of our own economic beliefs, the public, especially in the world’s richest countries, are seemingly questioning the benefits of a free trading system with politicians seemingly caught in a crisis of self confidence in what was once an article of faith for many.
Perhaps at least part of the explanation lies in the rate of change and reorientation of our economies and the fear of actual and potential displacement felt by many workforces.
In Britain we have seen industries like coal mining all but disappear, but new service industries and modern manufacturing take their place, including the growth of renewable energy. In areas such as steel production we have seen new technologies enable us to produce the same output with far fewer employees.
It is, and will be, new technology that will be the major disruptive force in our economies. We will best serve both our economies and our workforce not by turning our back on free trade, but by ensuring that we can provide mitigation for those who bear the brunt of change by providing the necessary economic support, especially in re-skilling, retraining and education.
Change is coming and we must embrace it – for our global competitors certainly will – but we must also be willing to reach out that helping hand to the men and women in our countries who will most feel the winds of change and use our skills, our experience and our knowledge to maximise the benefits for the generations to come.
We can bring prosperity and revival to some of our challenged industrial communities as they transition to new patterns of work as they have always done. From the agricultural age to the industrial revolution, to the rise of the knowledge economy, change is forever with us. Rather than seeking to avoid the realities of the globalised economy, we should ensure that its rising tide lifts all boats.
To do so, we require a set of global rules that are transparent, robust and enforceable and institutions that are credible and accountable. Despite its flaws, trade specialisation and innovation, largely as a result of globalisation, has spawned a productivity revolution through increased competition, economies of scale and global value chains.
When this is combined with the effect of liberal values of meritocracy, democracy and the rule of law, it can create a tidal wave of innovation and creativity.
It is no coincidence that the United Kingdom and the United States are among the world’s most innovative economies, while those with more authoritarian regimes are only now beginning to catch up as centralised planning at least in some cases gives way to individual creativity.
In the twentieth century, one of the products of the influence of the US and the UK in particular was the creation of the WTO.
From the founding in the aftermath of the Secord World War of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, the WTO emerged as the home of the rules-based international trading system, and the repository of those free trading values that have underpinned global growth and facilitated more formal trading agreements.
It is worth remembering that these rules, and the WTO itself, are not an external imposition on our economies, but were largely shaped and codified by the work of successive US and British governments.
In 1948, our nations were founding members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In 1986 it was the US, under President Reagan, that launched the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations that led to the establishment of the World Trade Organisation.
The United States has been at the heart of the WTO since the very beginning.
Of course, the system that we established in 1995 is also in need of some refurbishment.
After all, the global economy is now driven by advances in technology that were embryonic in 1995.
Who could have foreseen, for example, the rise of the digital economy? Or how knowledge and data have become so valuable? Or the blurring between goods and services? Just imagine the concept of selling a digital code on the internet to build something on a 3D printer. It would have sounded like science fiction when the WTO began.
The structures of the international system may not have caught up with the modern world. But that is cause for reform and renewal, not rejection. The UK and US are ideally placed to work together to modernise, and make the international rules-based trading system work better, so the benefits of free trade can truly be felt by all.
Above all, the WTO remains the way to ensure that a level playing field is created and maintained between the major actors in international trade but its rules must be enforceable and the actions of its members fully transparent if confidence is to be maintained.
All of this is occurring in a period of rapid change in the patterns of global trade.
The thriving economies of South and East Asia and, increasingly, Africa, are, and will become, ever more important as their newfound prosperity drives demand for the goods and services from more advanced economies, like the UK and the US.
The sheer scale of the change that is underway is often difficult to grasp from here in the West, in countries which have long enjoyed economic and political dominance.
Twice this year I have been in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 Shenzhen had a population of 5.2 million. Today it has a population of nearly 12.5 million.
By 2030 China is expected to have more than 220 cities with a population of more than a million. The whole of Europe has 35.
And on top of the vast Asia-Pacific growth it is predicted that there will be 1.1 billion middle class Africans by 2060. We are living through a period of profound and stunning change. Such a shift, not just in global demographics, but in the rise of the collective wealth of developing countries, will determine where the golden economic opportunities of the future will be – and where we must be too, if we are to provide jobs and prosperity for our peoples in the future.
If we are to navigate the changes that the next decade will bring, we have to fully accommodate these changes and recognise the emerging pattern of our own trade too. We cannot wish away change any more than we can ignore its effects. As I used to say to my patients when I still practised as a doctor ‘there’s no point in complaining about the air when there’s nothing else to breathe.’
Within a rapidly changing world, the trading relationship between the UK and the United States remains a consistent source of stability and prosperity. And it is our two nations that have the opportunity to negotiate a trailblazing, modern free trade agreement.
Because we both fundamentally believe in trading and commercial freedom, our interests are not in opposition to other countries – trade between us is not a zero-sum game.
The UK is the largest source of Foreign Direct Investment into the USA, with around $560bn of holdings here – more than France and Germany combined and 30 per cent more than Japan.
Our investment is also twenty times the investment from China, and thirty times that of Mexico.
British companies employ over a million workers across every state in the Union, from Ohio and Pennsylvania to Florida to California.
I don’t know if we have any Texans here today, but more than 107,000 people in the Lone Star State are employed by UK firms and I wonder how many of them understand that.
Likewise, American firms employee huge numbers of British people. We have more than a trillion dollars invested in one another’s economies – probably the most interdependent investment relationship on our planet today.
Yet we are also on the threshold of a renewed trading relationship that will further enrich both our nations.
For the first time in more than four decades, the United Kingdom will have an independent trade policy required to forge closer ties to our closest economic partner, through an ambitious free trade agreement.
It is an unprecedented opportunity for an ambitious and future-proof framework for our bilateral trade. We must not let it pass us by.
Likewise we must not fail to take the opportunity for global leadership in the areas where we already excel, particularly in trade in services and especially financial services. The UK and the US host the two leading global financial centres and are at the forefront of innovation. Our deep and broad relationship on financial services is a cornerstone of the modern global economy. We should make it even easier in the future for businesses to operate across the Atlantic through frictionless trade.
Fundamentally, our close economic ties are underpinned by the strong personal links that tie our two peoples. We share a common language, mostly, but also the ties of history, and even more importantly of values. We must also be linked by our shared ambition to shape the global economy in ways that match our shared interests.
It is not just in our economic interests but in our strategic interests for the long term.
For the past century our two nations have stood shoulder to shoulder against mankind’s gravest security threats. We have saved Europe in the 20th century from the twin scourges of Communism and Fascism.
We must have the optimism and self confidence now to shape it for the future: free markets, through free trade, for the benefit of free people.
I will leave you today with the words of President Reagan:
There is no greater prize than that.
Thank you.
"
Iain Duncan Smith,"As I said last night, out there in Smith Square, it has been an immense honour to have led the Conservative party for the last two years.
I very much hope that – as tonight seems likely – my successor is chosen quickly, so that we can all get behind the leader.
The new leader will have my absolute loyalty.
And I encourage all those members of the voluntary party who made me the first leader of the party elected by the grass roots, to also give that leader their whole-hearted support.
From this moment onwards, we must never again allow our own private interests and squabbles to distract us from the task of opposition – the task of exposing this government’s manifold failures and defeating them at the next election.
This speech was planned a little time ago, as the beginning of our great push to communicate the policies we announced at Blackpool.
I decided I wanted to make the speech here at the CPS.
This think-tank has always performed the role of intellectual pioneer for the Conservative Party, and, indeed, for the country…and I could think of a no better place to set out the programme for the first Conservative government of the 21st century – the government I hoped to lead.
Events, you might have noticed, have somewhat overtaken me.
But last night, after hearing the result of the confidence vote, I decided that I would still make this speech.
Because although I will not lead the first Conservative government of this century, I believe I have provided its manifesto, its policy prospectus.
I believe our Party now has an agenda as radical and attractive as that drawn up by Keith Joseph at the dawn of the Thatcher era.
I’d like to take this opportunity to pay particular tribute to Greg Clark and his team in the Policy Unit.
I know Greg has worked closely with the CPS in recent years and I am sorry he isn’t here tonight.
He wisely went on holiday to Mexico at the end of last week!
But he and his team – some of whom I see here – deserve the thanks of the entire party for what they have done.
It is my deepest wish that the policies they have worked on for so long will form the programme of the next Conservative government.
It is a settlement which, after much hard work, has won the support of all wings of the party – but which has lost none of its radicalism in the process.
Tonight I want to talk about four inter-linked principles which I hope Conservatives will continue to stand for, whoever is elected leader – …the principles which will be my legacy to this Party.
The first is the need for a complete renewal of our public services.
The second is the need to place social justice, and concern for the plight of the vulnerable, at the very core of Conservative thinking.
The third is the need for freedom, the rule of law and a strong and competitive economy.
And the fourth is the need to defend the state itself, and the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom.
The first task of the next Conservative government must be public service renewal.
Of course, Conservatives were the joint authors of the welfare state.
It was the Conservative health minister in Churchill’s wartime government who drew up the first plans for the NHS.
It was Rab Butler who passed the great Education Act of 1944, ensuring mass education for Britain’s children.
It was Harold Macmillan who, as housing minister in the early 50s, built up the public housing stock.
Conservatives can share the credit for the creation and maintenance of the welfare state… …but we must also take our share of the blame for its failures – and commit ourselves to its renewal.
The era of uniform, comprehensive, state-run services is over.
Consumers are no longer prepared to be told to get what they’re given and be grateful.
The professionals who deliver public services are no longer prepared to be treated like cogs in the machine.
Taxpayers are no longer prepared to be billed, again and again, to pay for the ever-rising cost of a failed system.
If the plans I have laid down are followed by my successor…the next Conservative government will make a real and immediate difference to people’s lives.
Every parent in England and Wales will have a Better Schools Passport, giving them total control over the education of their child.
Every citizen will have a Patient’s Passport, entitling them to free care anywhere in the NHS. And if, for whatever reason, they have to go private, they will get help to do so.
The right-to-buy programme will be extended…so that housing association tenants can also experience the satisfaction and responsibility of home ownership.
We will scrap Labour’s tuition fees for students and stopped their plans for extra top-up fees.
And we will work to end the means test for pensioners and improve and incentivise saving for retirement.
We will begin this process by raising the basic state pension in line with earnings.
All these are radical, feasible, Conservative policies.
They are based on the simple principle of trust.
The welfare state was founded in a period when people were expected to trust the government – not government to trust the people.
We’ll reverse that relationship.
Under the first Conservative government of the 21st century, the state will not be a monopoly provider of education and healthcare.
It will primarily be a funder, and a regulator.
Government will trust teachers and doctors, managers and ministers, to make the decisions about how they work.
Politicians often talk about how much we value our public service professionals. Conservative policies prove we mean it.
Second is my commitment to one nation Conservatism.
A child born into poverty in the first decade of the 21st century is more likely to stay poor than a child born into poverty in the 1950s.
This is a shameful fact.
Sadly, this Labour government – despite its best intentions – has not succeeded in reversing the trend.
Inequality has actually widened under Tony Blair.
Gordon Brown’s notional target of lifting a million children out of poverty has only been met by lifting families from just below the poverty line to just above it.
Persistent poverty – real, grinding hardship – has often got worse under Labour.
For too long the Labour Party have abused a monopoly position on these issues.
Labour have failed to address the material roots of poverty and haven’t even begun to address the relational and spiritual dimensions of deprivation.
But if Conservatives are to become an effective party of social justice we must not just oppose the worn-out approach of the liberal left…
We must also oppose the nihilistic individualism of the libertarian right.
One nation will never be built if public policy ignores some of the leading causes of poverty… Causes like family breakdown and drug addiction.
There is nothing compassionate about weakness in the face of the drug menace.
Social justice will never be achieved if government undermines society’s most basic institution – …the marriage-centred family and the many people of all backgrounds who benefit from its care.
The poverty and crime killing so many communities won’t be defeated if we don’t help young people stay off drugs and recover from their addictions.
That much was made clear to me when I met with a support group for the parents and grandparents of drug addicts in Glasgow.
The faith and courage of the Gallowgate Family Support Group also taught me that drugs can be defeated.
As Jim Doherty of that support group told me – “just give us hope and we will do the rest.” If the Conservative Party has half as much courage as those parents and grandparents, …then we will go forward to the next election with a policy on drugs that does – indeed – bring hope to Britain’s hard-pressed communities.
We will also need courage if we are to do the right thing by Britain’s hard-pressed families. Those who believe that family breakdown is a purely private matter are blind to the enormous public consequences – …as well as the personal consequences for the children to which we all owe a duty of care.
I am personally determined that a hard-headed and open-hearted approach to questions of poverty becomes a central theme of conversation and debate within the Conservative Party.
An effective approach to drugs.
Help for families to stay together.
And a renewal of very local forms of voluntary activity and social entrepreneurship that often succeed where the centralised state fails.
These should be the leading ingredients of one nation Conservatism in the twenty-first century.
My social justice agenda springs from my visit to Easterhouse in February 2002.
That was dismissed by many as a media stunt.
But that visit – and many more to hard-pressed neighbourhoods since – have had a profound impact on me.
If my main legacy to the Conservative Party is a body of policy……my commitment to fight poverty is that body’s beating heart.
In the coming weeks I intend to think carefully about how I, personally, will take that commitment forward.
The third principle I wish to leave my successor is the enduring Conservative commitment to freedom.
Not a freedom that cuts people off from one another…but build communities where no one is held back by a lack of opportunity, and no one is left behind by a lack of compassion.
Today, Britain feels like a place where you need a license to live your life.
Taxes have risen by a half since 1997 – regulations rule every aspect of our lives.
We must cut taxes and red tape.
The next Conservative government must be a low tax government.
It was John Stuart Mill who said: ‘a state that dwarfs its citizens, will find that with small men, no great things can be accomplished’.
Today we are too afraid of risk…the risks that bring reward.
Everything I have been talking about tonight tends to this: we must unleash the creative energies of the British people…to serve themselves, their families and their communities far more effectively than the state ever will.
But there is another freedom – the freedom from fear.
You can’t have a free people without order.
That’s why the fight against crime is a fight for freedom.
Conservative proposals will deliver 40,000 extra policemen and give every local community real control of their local force.
I now come to my third principle of my legacy to the Conservative Party.
Labour has not only undermined the cultural defences of civilisation.
It has undermined the state itself.
It has politicised the civil service.
Eroded civil liberties.
Suborned our once-independent intelligence services.
Neglected the armed forces.
And held in Parliament in contempt.
I have talked about a Government that trusts people.
We also need a Government that people can trust.
Conservatives must restore the integrity of our national institutions – and restore integrity to public life.
Most of all, we must have some honesty about Europe.
Because we are now, truly, at a fork in the road.
It has been the genius of our evolving Constitution that every step forward has been the continuation of an older tradition.
But this is different.
The proposed EU Constitution represents an explicit and total break with the past.
The Constitution gives EU law primacy over UK law, and creates the European Court of Justice as the sovereign legal authority of the United Kingdom …the position previously held by the Queen in Parliament.
This Treaty is something no Government can accept on the authority of its own elected mandate.
The British Constitution is not the property of Tony Blair, to do with as he will.
It is the property of the British people, held by the Government only in trust.
No Prime Minister or Member of Parliament can vote away the basis on which he holds his office or his seat.
So I have established the Conservative Party policy on this question: we are against the European constitution in principle.
Three months ago, in Prague, I set out Conservative policy clearly and simply – and with the support of all wings of the party.
Under the Conservatives, Britain will reclaim exclusive control of agriculture, fisheries and foreign aid.
We will stem the tide of European regulation, and refuse to be part of a common foreign policy or a European army.
And we will retain control of our borders and of our economy.
This is not a blueprint for withdrawal from the EU.
It is a positive step towards the sort of EU which most Europeans want: diverse, flexible, comprising independent states.
We must build a new Europe.
Not a single, unitary and unaccountable super-state …but a loose association of independent democracies, co-operating as they see fit but retaining their sovereign right to run their own affairs.
We must take this vision forward.
A great deal has changed for me over the past two years.
Serving as leader of the opposition meant challenges on a scale that no one who hasn’t done the job can appreciate.
There have been some privileges – but many more problems!
All of this – from the sweet moments of victory to the bitter moments of defeat – have changed me.
I’m still stubborn, and self-opinionated – and I’m still almost always right!
But anyone with a modicum of sensitivity and insight – and I hope I’ve got at least a bit of both – …couldn’t help but be changed by what I’ve seen and done since 2001.
So I’ve got an admission.
I’ve been on a journey.
A political journey as well as one all around this country.
I’ve been appalled by much of what I’ve seen.
In 21st century Britain, children dying of drugs that their parents died of too.
In 21st century Britain, poverty still real.
In 21st century Britain, pensioners trapped in their homes by fear of crime.
On this journey, I’ve been reminded of something that lies deep in the Conservative conscience… …buried too deep for too long……that our party fulfils its greatest purpose when we bring social solidarity by delivering social justice.
The people who taught me this lesson weren’t academics.
They certainly weren’t the national media.
Our party is sometimes accused by the media of being out of touch with modern Britain.
In truth, the whole political class has lost touch with those in greatest need.
Can we wonder that millions despair of politicians – and so opt out of the political process?
My teachers were those often patronisingly described by those on the Westminster scene as ‘ordinary people’.
In Gallowgate and Easterhouse, Hackney and Handsworth…I’ve met extra-ordinary people who fight for the poorest Britons, in communities ruined by drugs and crime.
These remarkable men and women taught me more about leadership than any politician could have.
They are real leaders.
Their strength is their certain belief in the most profound of human qualities – hope, compassion, and a sense of fairness …beliefs derived from real lives, lived on the front line.
The only meaningful freedoms for them are the freedom from fear and want, crime and addiction – they yearn not for license, but for order.
My journey is not a trip to an uncertain future – but the journey home.
To a Conservative home, where the security of family and community bring hope and fairness.
My journey is not over.
My mission will continue.
It is the Conservative mission for fairness…
…true to our inheritance…
…vital for our people…
…worthy of our nation.
"
Nick Gibb,"Thank you for inviting me to join the ASCL curriculum summit today.
Developing a well-thought-through, challenging school curriculum is central to the running of any school, and this is a topic I am always keen to discuss.
Schools are making significant changes to their curriculum to prepare for new examinations. Next month, primary pupils will for the first time sit tests assessing them on the new national curriculum. New GCSEs in maths and English are already being taught, and will be examined for the first time next year. And this September, secondary schools will see the first teaching of 20 new GCSEs, and 11 new A levels.
The subject of school curriculum is also timely from a historical perspective. This year marks the 40th anniversary of Jim Callaghan’s ‘Ruskin speech’, a landmark speech in which Callaghan in many ways set the direction of reform for the next 4 decades.
Back in 1976, Callaghan alluded to the significant concerns that existed amongst parents and employers about the form many school curriculum had taken during the ‘experimental’ atmosphere of the mid-1970s. He suggested that there is, I quote, a “strong case for the so-called ‘core curriculum’ of basic knowledge” in schools.
In doing so, Callaghan was making a bold foray into an area of school life which had been dubbed the ‘secret garden’, to which educationists had previously been granted exclusive access, and politicians and the public had never seen fit to tread.
But, as Callaghan said at the time, £6 billion is spent every year on education, so in his view public interest in how this money is spent was, I quote, “strong and legitimate”. I believe the same is true today, though the figure of overall expenditure rather higher.
The government’s curriculum reforms, which began in 2010, have been a lengthy and thoroughgoing process, but necessarily so. Many changes which began 6 years ago are only now hitting the ground in schools. With that in mind, today is an opportune moment to revisit the original justification for these reforms.
In 2010, 64% of pupils achieved a level 4 in reading, writing and mathematics at the end of primary school, but we were continually hearing from secondary schools that even pupils who arrived brandishing their level 4s were not, in fact, sufficiently prepared. Pupils unable to write cogently, or perform basic procedures in mathematics, were being judged as having met the expected standard aged 11.
At GCSE, 55% of pupils achieved the ‘minimum standard’ of 5 GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and mathematics. However, this number masked a multitude of deficiencies. The design of performance measures encouraged pupils to enter ‘equivalent qualifications’ in less academically demanding subjects, which employers told us they didn’t value. And there was widespread suspicion of grade inflation within the profession and amongst employers.
Having compared the reported improvement in GCSE results to an annual benchmarked aptitude test, Professor Coe concluded that the question, I quote, “is not whether there has been grade inflation, but how much”.
Lastly, there was a widespread feeling that qualifications, in particular GCSEs, did not represent the mastery of a sufficiently challenging body of subject knowledge. Did a good GCSE in history represent a basic understanding of the chronology of Britain’s past? Did a good GCSE in MFL mean a degree of fluency in the language? Did a good GCSE in English literature mean a pupil had read widely from the corpus of great works?
We all know the cliché of older generations asking their children, or grandchildren, ‘don’t they teach you that at school?’ We were determined to allow the children of tomorrow to answer such inquisitions, ‘yes, in fact, they do’.
Before 2010, pupils’ future life chances were being sacrificed for an illusion of success, which served short-term political expediency. Our objective whilst in government from that date onwards has always been to help build an education system that instead is designed for the long-term benefit of pupils.
More challenging standards may mean a temporary drop in the reported success rate of pupils – for example for those taking their key stage 2 national assessments in 2 weeks’ time. But this is something that we are unafraid to oversee. Because let me ask you: what is a more responsible political decision? To be realistic about the level of numeracy or literacy a child has achieved at the end of primary school, and increase the likelihood that any shortfall is addressed; or to tell a child that they have reached an adequate level of literacy and numeracy for their age, when their secondary school will state they have not?
You do not need me to tell you that the implementation of the new key stage 1 and key stage 2 tests has been bumpy, and I and the department are more than willing to accept that some things could have been smoother. The current frameworks for teacher assessment, for example, are interim, precisely because we know that teething problems that exist in this phase of reform need to leave room for revision.
But against those who attack the underlying principle of these reforms, I stand firm in my belief that they are right and necessary. Our new tests in grammar, punctuation and spelling have been accused by many in the media of teaching pupils redundant or irrelevant information. “Completely inappropriate” was the verdict of one union general secretary interviewed on Radio 4 last week.
One fundamental outcome of a good education system must be that all children, not just the offspring of the wealthy and privileged, are able to write fluent, cogent and grammatically correct English. This is the sort of written language which tutors expect to see in university essays and employers expect to see in a covering letter. All children, irrespective of birth or background, should be able to write prose where verbs agree with subjects, commas separate independent clauses, and pronouns agree in number with the nouns to which they refer.
Now, for children from homes where parents read and share books with their family, it may be possible over time to assimilate such grammatical rules indirectly. But for a great number of children in our schools, the easiest way for a teacher to explain to their pupils the rules that govern our language is to ensure that both have a shared vocabulary of grammatical terms. And when it comes to learning a foreign language, the benefit of having a shared vocabulary of grammatical terms is, again, enormous.
And, of course, the learned op-eds which attack the addition of grammar to the national curriculum are always grammatically correct – why the writers would want to take from children the ability to write with the accuracy that they consistently display is beyond me. It often occurs to me that grammatical knowledge, as with knowledge more generally, is much like money: only those who have it can be complacent enough to deny its importance.
This is also why we are undertaking the process of enhancing the subject content of our GCSEs. The new mathematics GCSE introduces more demanding content, such as ensuring pupils work with percentages higher than 100%, and use inequality notation to specify truncation or rounding errors.
Teachers are also half way through teaching the new English literature GCSE. I recently read a blog by an English teacher about planning for the new exam, in which he wrote, “I’m not afraid to say that, in our humble little department, we’re rather enjoying it”. His English department had been writing long-term plans to teach new texts: ‘Lord of the Flies’, ‘A Christmas Carol’, ‘Macbeth’ and a number of poems.
The texts that awarding organisations are offering for the new GCSE show a rich and rewarding span of literature old and new, from ‘Animal Farm’ to ‘Anita and Me’, Charlotte Bronte to Kazuo Ishiguro. In 2010, 90% of pupils studying for an English literature GCSE read, as their only text, the same short novella. Such narrowing of the GCSE curriculum is no longer possible.
The aforementioned blog was titled, ‘The New English GCSEs: a pleasure, not a chore’, and this is the spirit in which I hope that other new GCSEs are taken on in schools.
Geography teachers will teach the geography of the country we live in and the world in greater depth to their pupils, and carry out at least 2 pieces of fieldwork outside the classroom. Science teachers will address topics from the cutting edge of their subject – such as the human genome in biology, and nanoparticles in chemistry.
The new computer science GCSE will require students to understand mathematical principles and concepts such as data representation, Boolean logic and different data types. Students will also have to understand the components of computer systems, and write and refine programs.
In history, teachers can break away from the previous diet of predominantly 20th-century history that pupils have commonly studied at GCSE for 2 decades. History teachers with a passion for the medieval period can now teach in-depth studies of the Norman Conquest or Edward I. Those teachers with a passion for the early modern can choose between Spain and the ‘New World’, or the Restoration.
I am pleased to say that in all of the new GCSE and A level subjects, Ofqual has accredited at least one exam board qualification. I am also delighted that high-quality GCSEs and A levels in a range of community languages, such as Panjabi, Portuguese and Japanese, will continue. This comes as a result of government action and the commitment from those exam boards who have worked with us to protect these languages.
Of course, planning for these new examinations is placing a significant workload on teachers for the next 2 years. But as workload burdens go, I hope that secondary school teachers will see this as a chance to re-engage with the subject they love, the subject that they went into teaching to communicate.
In addition, a host of reforms that we have pursued since 2010 have been explicitly geared towards reducing extraneous workload burdens for teachers, freeing them to focus on the areas of school life, like the curriculum, that really matter. It is no longer compulsory to write a SEF for Ofsted; the inspectorate no longer require individual lesson plans during inspections; and we have removed 21,000 pages of unnecessary guidance for schools, reducing the volume by 75%, and centralising all that remains in one place on the GOV.UK website.
In addition, the independent workload reports which were published last month offer clear and constructive guidance for schools and for government, to ensure that such burdens reduce further.
The reformed performance measures which coincide with the new GCSEs will free teachers’ time to value the progress of every pupil individually, whether they are on the cusp of achieving a C or a new grade 5 or striving to reach an A* or a new grade 8 or 9.
On the topic of performance measures, there have been concerns amongst ASCL members about our aspiration that, in time, 90% of pupils will be entered for the EBacc. And I understand why these concerns exist. The key concern appears to be the challenge of teaching modern foreign languages to a much larger proportion of pupils, in terms of both recruitment of teachers and achieving success for lower attaining pupils.
There is work afoot on both fronts to tackle these concerns. We are in the early stages of developing a range of programmes to boost the number of teachers recruited to teach foreign languages in our schools. And I am delighted that today the Teaching Schools Council announced their forthcoming review into how foreign languages are taught in secondary schools. Led by former ASCL President Ian Bauckham, this report will look at rigorous research and international evidence, and provide schools across the country with thought-provoking, practical advice on how to pursue the most effective method for teaching foreign languages to their pupils.
Many have challenged the fundamental premise of the EBacc performance measure, arguing that a core academic curriculum up to the age of 16 is not suitable for all pupils. This is a claim with which I cannot agree. A tacit snobbery about ‘kids like these’ – which so often means kids from poorer homes – can lie behind such claims. Indeed, research by the Sutton Trust has revealed that high-achieving pupils of precisely the same starting point at secondary schools are significantly less likely to be entered into the EBacc if they are on free school meals. In 2015, 19% of pupils in Knowsley were entered for the EBacc, compared with 58.9% of pupils in Barnet.
An academic education is the entitlement of every child, irrespective of birth or background. All school leavers should be able to partake in intelligent conversation, and to do so children need to be given a good level of cultural literacy. This should be seen as a foundational purpose of any school.
It is the luxury of living in today’s world that there is no rush to start studying for the workplace. All pupils can be afforded the time and opportunity to be initiated into the great conversations of humankind, and develop an intellectual hinterland which will last them a lifetime.
In his Ruskin speech, Callaghan attacked the view that lower attaining pupils should be fitted with, I quote, “just enough learning to earn their living in the factory”. His retort was that all schools should, I quote, “equip children to the best of their ability for a lively, constructive place in their society”.
The same mission lies behind the EBacc policy. A child will almost certainly end up working in a job far removed from the curriculum content that they studied at school. But to limit the work of school to the world of work is depressingly reductive. Adults do not just work: they also read, converse, travel, vote and participate in other processes of democratic life. Just because someone goes on to work in a technical or scientific field, it does not mean they should not enjoy great literature, understand the history of their own country, or be able to communicate in a language other than their own.
All children can rise to this challenge. The structural reforms undertaken by this government have created extraordinary school success stories, which force all of us to revise our expectations about what children, particularly those from deprived backgrounds, can achieve.
King Solomon Academy sits in one of the most disadvantaged boroughs of London for child poverty – 44% of its pupils are eligible for free school meals – just over 3 times the national average. Yet last year, 77% of their pupils achieved the English Baccalaureate – compared to a national figure of 24%. The Tauheedul Islam Girls High School in Blackburn has a higher than average proportion of disadvantaged pupils, and 95% of its pupils speak English as a second language. Yet last year, 74% of their pupils achieved the EBacc.
Lastly, I would like to talk briefly about the importance of focusing on curriculum as a means of school improvement. Many during Callaghan’s time referred to the curriculum as the ‘secret garden’ for policy makers, but I think that the curriculum has also in recent history been something of a ‘secret garden’ in schools – an issue which is seen as slightly peripheral when it comes to driving improvement.
I am delighted to see how many schools are now thinking about how to devise a curriculum that consistently challenges their pupils, and does not allow a single year to be wasted.
Ark Schools, which has been devising a mathematics curriculum to be taught in all its schools based on the mastery principles of south Asian countries. Harris Academies and the Inspiration Trust have both appointed teachers to work across their schools in certain subjects, driving improvements on the quality of curriculum taught to their pupils.
Last year, a think tank called the Center for American Progress published a report entitled ‘The hidden value of curriculum reform’, which showed that adopting new curriculum resources is an inexpensive, effective and currently under-recognised means of improving pupil outcomes.
Their claim was based on an analysis of 4 elementary school mathematics curricula, conducted by the US Department of Education in 2011.
The Center for American Progress report created a minor tremor on Twitter thanks to the claim that – compared to other school improvement policies – adopting an effective school curriculum such as Saxon maths has almost 40 times the average cost-effectiveness ratio.
Due to the increased challenge of national examinations, and the new degree of innovation occurring in schools and academy trusts, I believe the conversation about curriculum taking place today is of a higher quality than at any time in the past. And this is a conversation that should lie at the heart of any successful school.
"
Ed Balls,"Conference, we meet here in Brighton.
With the General Election now just nineteen months away
Determined to defeat this out of touch Tory-led Government.
Knowing that we have more work to do to win back the trust of the British people.
And fully aware that no party since the 1920s has gone from losing office to a working majority at the next general election.
So Conference, this is our task.
To show we are ready for the great challenges we will face on spending control and the deficit.
To set out Labour’s alternative plan to create jobs, make work pay and tackle the rising cost of living.
And to secure a mandate to build a One Nation Britain:
A strong recovery that is built to last.
An economy that works for the many and not just a few at the top.
Conference, not just for the few, but for all working families in every part of Britain.
And Conference, three and a half years after the General Election defeat, we have learned from that experience and our time in government. And where we got things wrong – on immigration control, bank regulation and the 10p tax rate – the next Labour government will be different from the last.
And where change is needed in our party, we will reconnect with our members and working people across the country.
But Conference, let us also be proud of what the last Labour government achieved.
The national minimum wage.
Our schools and hospitals rebuilt.
NHS waiting times down from 18 months to 18 weeks.
More apprenticeships.
Bank of England independence.
Not joining the Euro.
1 million more small businesses.
Crime down.
Child poverty down.
And 3,500 Sure Start children’s centres – one of the most important reforms any Labour government has ever delivered.
And Conference, replacing the Tory abomination that was Section 28 with civil partnerships.
Paving the way for a landmark reform, something which would not have happened without Labour votes in Parliament, the progressive triumph of gay marriage.
And Conference, as we look forward to the General Election to come, determined to win a Labour majority, I want you all to know:
As the Labour and Co-operative MP for Morley &amp; Outwood – majority just one thousand, one hundred and one – the seat David Cameron needed to win to get a Tory majority in 2010 and, because of our hard work and determination, the seat he failed to win… Conference, I am up for the battle to come.
And as Chair of our Economic Policy Commission, I know this whole party is up for the battle to come. And Conference, please join me in thanking my co-Chair, Margaret Beckett, for her continuing hard work and service to this party not just over the past year but over four decades in Parliament.
And Conference, as a proud member of the Unite and Unison trade unions, I know this whole movement is up for the battle to come.
So in the coming months let us lay the foundations for the General Election.
Selecting the best Parliamentary Candidates we have ever had, with more women candidates in key seats than ever before.
Winning council seats and by-elections up and down the country with the toughest and best generation of local government leaders we have ever had.
Winning more seats in the European elections. And let us end the stain on our country’s reputation by kicking the BNP out of the European Parliament.
And Conference, in next September’s Scottish referendum.
With Alistair Darling, Johann Lamont and Margaret Curran now showing so powerfully that the arguments for separation are falling apart.
With Alex Salmond in a state of total confusion on the single most important economic decision a country can take – which currency to have: first he wanted the Euro – saying sterling was a “millstone around our neck” and now he wants independence but to keep the pound all the same.
Let us win the argument that we are Better Together in next year’s Scottish referendum.
Demonstrating, as Carwyn Jones and Welsh Labour have done so brilliantly, that it is our Labour values of co-operation, solidarity and social justice that best secure our union.
And Conference, it is Labour whose leader is facing up to the need for reform in our party and in our country.
Leading from the front – on phone-hacking, banking reform, putting the crisis of the ‘squeezed middle’ on the political agenda before anyone else.
And who on Syria had the courage to stand up and say that if the case was sound and the United Nations was properly engaged, Labour would support military action, but that Labour would not support a gung-ho Prime Minister, putting decision before evidence in a reckless dash to conflict.
Conference, Ed was right – and he prevailed. My friend, our leader, Britain’s next Prime Minister, Ed Miliband.
And Conference, when David Cameron and William Hague now have the nerve to go round saying that Parliament’s refusal to be bounced into military action in Syria has ‘diminished’ Britain, let us reply: no Labour government will ever stand aside when terrible atrocities are committed and international law is broken.
But Conference, we know what has diminished Britain.
Flouncing out of a European summit, leaving Britain isolated and without influence. That’s what has diminished Britain.
Absurdly comparing Britain to Greece and choking off business confidence and our recovery as a result. That’s what has diminished Britain.
Stigmatising the unemployed and the low paid and calling them shirkers, driving vans round out streets telling immigrants to ‘go home’, attacking our police and teachers and social workers, peddling the lie that ‘Britain is broken’. That’s what has diminished Britain.
Conference, we know who diminishes Britain.
David Cameron has diminished Britain.
Conference, we all remember what David Cameron and George Osborne said three years ago on the economy.
They claimed in 2010 that faster tax rises and deeper spending cuts would secure the economic recovery and make it stronger…
They said their plan would make people better off and get the deficit down.
And on every test they set themselves, this Prime Minister and Chancellor have failed.
They didn’t secure the recovery, they choked it off – as we warned – and flatlined our economy for three wasted and damaging years.
They claimed living standards would rise – but they’ve fallen year on year.
They made the number one test of their economic credibility keeping the triple A credit rating – but on their watch Britain has been downgraded, not once but twice.
They promised to balance the books in 2015 – but the deficit is now set to be over £90 billion.
And now after three wasted years, David Cameron and George Osborne now try to claim their plan has worked after all.
Worked? It may have worked for a privileged few at the top, but for the million young people trapped out of work, this Tory plan isn’t working.
For millions of ordinary families, worried about how to make ends meet when wages are falling, and prices are going up
For the young couples struggling to get on the housing ladder because the chronic shortage of homes is forcing up prices
For ordinary working families – the aspirational majority – who work hard, pay their taxes, who want to get on and not just get by, but who are working harder for less as the cost of living keeps on rising
This Tory plan isn’t working.
And for the 400,000 disabled adults forced to pay the Government’s perverse and deeply unfair bedroom tax, this Tory plan has failed them absolutely. And that is why in our first Budget the next Labour government will repeal the bedroom tax.
So when David Cameron and George Osborne say that everything that is happening in the economy is down to them.
Let us remind them:
– Prices rising faster than wages for 38 out of the 39 months since David Cameron entered Downing Street
– 3 years of flatlining
– The slowest recovery for over 100 years
– A million young people out of work
– Welfare spending soaring
– More borrowing to pay for their economic failure
That is their economic record. And we will not let them forget it.
I say to David Cameron and George Osborne: you can’t just air-brush away three wasted years, you can’t just air-brush away your economic failure.
And as for their claim that “we’re all in this together’, we don’t hear that line much anymore.
Conference, with the deficit still high and ordinary families struggling with a cost of living crisis, how can it be right or fair for David Cameron and George Osborne to have chosen this year to give the richest people in the country, earning over £150,000 a year, a £3 billion tax cut?
And isn’t it now clear whose side David Cameron and George Osborne are really on?
Cutting taxes for hedge funds.
Trying to bribe working people to give up their rights.
Country suppers at Chequers for Tory party fund-raising.
Protecting the privileges of the few, while the many work hard and don’t see the benefit.
For all their claims to be modernisers, with Cameron and Osborne, it’s not been “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” it’s “Who Wants to Help a Millionaire?”
Not “phone a friend”, but “cut taxes for your friends.”
Not “50-50” but “winner takes all”.
Conference, isn’t it about time they “asked the audience”?
Because we know the truth. The country knows the truth.
David Cameron and George Osborne.
For the few, not the many.
More of the same, from the same old Tories.
Conference, after three years of stagnation, it’s good news that our economy has finally started to grow again.
It was growing three years ago before they choked it off.
So don’t listen to the Tory propaganda that says Labour doesn’t want the economy to grow.
What nonsense. Because when the economy is in recession we know which communities lose out. When unemployment becomes entrenched, we know which constituencies suffer most. When the cost of living is rising, we know which families are hardest hit.
We know that three years of flat lining – far longer than any of us expected – have caused long-term damage: businesses bankrupt, investment and capacity lost, long-term unemployment entrenched.
And now even as growth finally returns, with prices still rising faster than wages, with business investment still weak, with unemployment still rising in half the country, with bank lending to business still falling, we can’t be satisfied.
For millions of families this is no recovery at all.
And when around the world emerging markets are jittery, China is slowing, oil prices are rising and the Eurozone is still stuck with chronic low growth, I say this is no time for complacency, to sit back with fingers crossed.
And that is why we have urged George Osborne to act to secure a strong recovery.
Because what Britain needs is strong enough growth so that we can catch up the ground we have lost and so that everyone can feel the benefit.
Not a recovery that only works for some, not early hikes in interest and mortgage rates as a weak British economy hits the inflationary buffers, but a recovery that works for all and is built to last.
That is why, along with voices from the Bank of England and the IMF, we are right to be concerned that the Government is boosting housing demand – with a taxpayer mortgage guarantee on houses of up to £600,000 – while doing nothing about the supply of housing which has fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s.
George, it’s basic economics. If you push up housing demand, but don’t act to boost housing supply, all that happens is that you push house prices up and up. And the end result is that the very people your policy should be helping – young first time buyers – will find it even harder to get on the housing ladder.
And Conference, I have to ask, when we need to secure stronger growth and invest for the future, how can it make sense for George Osborne to be planning to cut infrastructure investment in 2015?
That is why we have consistently said, it is why the IMF have said, bring forward £10 billion of infrastructure investment right now, build 400,000 affordable houses over the next two years, create half a million jobs and thousands of apprenticeships. That is the way to secure an economy that works for all and is built to last.
But Conference, we can’t rely on George Osborne to do the right thing.
And we stand to inherit a very difficult situation.
After three wasted years of lost growth, far from balancing the books, in 2015 there is now set to be a deficit of over £90 billion.
David Cameron and George Osborne’s failure on the economy has led to their failure to get the deficit down, and it will be up to the next Labour government to finish the job.
And I need to be straight with this Conference and the country about what that means.
The government’s day to day spending totals for 2015/16 will have to be our starting point. Any changes to the current spending plans for that year will be fully funded and set out in advance in our manifesto. There will be no more borrowing for day to day spending. And we will set out tough fiscal rules – to balance the current budget and get the national debt on a downward path.
Of course Labour will always make different choices.
We will combine iron discipline on spending control with a fairer approach to deficit reduction.
And with our zero-based review – a review of every pound spent by government from the bottom up – Rachel Reeves and my Shadow Cabinet colleagues have begun the work of identifying savings so that we can switch resources to Labour’s priorities.
But we won’t be able to reverse all the spending cuts and tax rises the Tories have pushed through.
And we will have to govern with less money around. The next Labour government will have to make cuts too. Because while jobs and growth are vital to getting the deficit down – something this government has never understood – they cannot magic the whole deficit away at a stroke.
So delivering our Labour goals will be harder than at any time in living memory.
But it can be done – if we get people back to work and strengthen our economy, cut out waste and focus relentlessly on our priorities, and make sure difficult choices are not ducked, but are rooted in our values, in fairness and in common sense.
So Conference, at a time when the public services that pensioners rely on are under such pressure, we cannot continue paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners.
We won’t be able to reverse the Government’s cuts to child benefit for the highest earners.
We will keep the benefits cap, but make sure it properly reflects local housing costs.
We will have a cap on structural social security spending.
And yes, over the long-term, as our population ages, there will need to be increases in the retirement age.
But a fairer approach to deficit reduction means we will also crack down on tax avoidance, scrap the shares for rights scheme and reverse the tax cut for hedge funds.
And we will insist that all the proceeds from the sale of our stakes in Lloyds and RBS are used not for a one-off pre-election tax giveaway – but instead every penny of profit used to repay the national debt.
Conference, fiscal responsibility in the national interest.
And with our zero-based review, we will make different choices.
So we will ask: can we improve care and save money, as Andy Burnham has proposed, by pooling health and social care as a single service, with a single budget and joint management?
And Conference, we will repeal the damaging and costly Tory privatisation of the NHS.
And we will ask: does it really make sense to have separate costly management and bureaucracy for so many separate government departments, agencies, fire services and police forces?
And Conference, we won’t pay for new free schools in areas where there are excess school places, while parents in other areas are struggling to get their children into a local school,
And on infrastructure, we need more long-term investment – and we will assess the case for capital investment as we prepare our Manifesto – but we must also set the right priorities and get value for money.
Conference, we support investment in better transport links for the future. And we continue to back the idea of a new North-South rail link.
But under this government the High Speed 2 project has been totally mismanaged and the costs have shot up to £50 billion.
David Cameron and George Osborne have made clear they will go full steam ahead with this project – no matter how much the costs spiral up and up. They seem willing to put their own pride and vanity above best value for money for the taxpayer.
Labour will not take this irresponsible approach. So let me be clear, in tough times – when there is less money around and a big deficit to get down – there will be no blank cheque from me as a Labour Chancellor for this project or for any project.
Because the question is – not just whether a new High Speed line is a good idea or a bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50 billion for the future of our country.
And Conference, in tough times it’s even more important that all our policies and commitments are properly costed and funded.
The British people rightly want to know that the sums add up.
So we will go one step further and ask the independent Office for Budget Responsibility – the watchdog set up by this government – to independently audit the costings of every individual spending and tax measure in Labour’s manifesto at the next election.
This is the first time a Shadow Chancellor – the first time any political party in Britain – has ever said it wants this kind of independent audit.
It’s a radical change from what’s gone before, but the right thing to do to help restore trust in politics.
Conference, you know we need economic responsibility and fiscal rigour.
And we can’t write all the details of our first Budget today – when we don’t know the state of the economy and public finances that we will inherit.
But after three wasted years of Tory failure, people are rightly now asking what will Labour do differently.
So now, with nineteen months to go to the election, this week is the right time to begin setting out Labour ‘s alternative.
Conference, as Liam Byrne has said, Labour won’t stand aside when there are almost one million young people out of work, and when long-term unemployment is so high.
And we know we can’t make our economy grow more strongly, get the costs of welfare down and deal with the deficit if we are squandering the talents of so many.
So building on the success of Labour’s Future Jobs Fund – so short-sightedly scrapped by this government – we will introduce a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee for young people and the long-term unemployed.
We will fund this by a repeat of the tax on bank bonuses and by restricting pension tax relief for the very highest earners to the same rate as the average taxpayer.
And we will work with employers to make sure there will be a paid job for all young people out of work for more than 12 months and adults out of work for two years or more, which people will have to take up or lose benefits.
That is welfare reform that works.
Matching rights with responsibilities.
Getting young people into work and ending the scourge of long-term unemployment once and for all.
Conference, when people get into work they should always be better off – it should always pay more to be in work than on benefits.
So we must do more to make work pay.
The national minimum wage is one of Labour’s proudest achievements.
It was opposed by the Tories every step of the way.
Even now some Conservatives say the minimum wage should be suspended.
And its value has fallen by 5 per cent in real terms since 2010.
So Labour must now fight to protect and strengthen the national minimum wage.
Increasing the fines for those who exploit workers.
Strengthening the national minimum wage, restoring its value and catching up the ground lost over the last three years.
And encouraging employers to go further and pay the Living Wage.
And Conference, to move Labour on from the past and put Labour where it should always be – on the side of working people – we will introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax.
Conference, a tax cut for 25 million hard-working people on middle and lower incomes.
And we will pay for it by introducing a mansion tax on properties worth over £2m, introduced in a fair way, so that foreign investors who buy up property in London to make a profit will finally pay a proper tax contribution to our country.
But for many families high child care costs are a real problem and can mean that it doesn’t even add up to go to work.
Childcare is a vital part of our economic infrastructure that, alongside family support and flexible working, should give parents the choice to stay at home with their children when they are very small and to balance work and family as they grow older.
So to make work pay for families, we must act.
Stephen Twigg set out yesterday how we will guarantee childcare available for all primary school children from 8am to 6pm.
But we need to do more for families with nursery age children too.
Conference, after the financial crisis, it is right that the banks make a greater contribution.
And here is how we can.
In the last financial year, the banks paid a staggering £2.7bn less in overall tax than they did in 2010.
Over the last two years the government’s bank levy has raised £1.6 billion less than even they said it would.
At a time when resources are tight and families are under pressure that cannot be right.
So I can announce today, the next Labour government will increase the bank levy rate to raise an extra £800m a year.
And we will use the money, for families where all parents are in work, to increase free childcare places for 3 and 4 years olds from 15 hours to 25 hours a week.
For the first time, parents will be able to work part-time without having to worry about the cost of childcare.
Making work pay.
Tackling the cost of living crisis.
A radical transformation in the provision of childcare in our country.
And we need a radical transformation in our economy too.
Because in the twenty-first century, the companies and countries that will succeed will be those who can exploit the huge opportunities the new digital age and the era of big data are bringing – in high-value manufacturing, digital media, education and medical technology.
And the question is whether we will seize this opportunity or squander it?
Because we and British business know we have no future trying to undercut emerging market economies like India, China and Brazil on cost and wages.
And that is why so many companies look at this Government’s record on industrial policy with increasing dismay:
The RDAs abolished.
The Heseltine growth review neutered.
The Business Bank a damp squib.
Apprenticeships for young people falling.
Energy policy in chaos.
Borrowing powers for the Green Investment Bank postponed.
And on infrastructure, dither, delay and inaction.
Conference, we cannot succeed as a country with this ‘race to the bottom’, deregulation, laissez-faire and old-style ‘trickle-down economics’.
It’s a narrow and defeatist vision.
Doomed to fail.
And we have seen it fail before.
Just look at the British car industry in the 1970s and 1980s. Trying to compete on cost. Cutting back on innovation, quality and skills. Plagued by terrible industrial relations.
And now look at the renaissance of Jaguar Land Rover – creating thousands more jobs and exporting round the world.
Not by cutting corners, but based on world-class, long-term investment in innovation, skills and supply-chains.
Chuka Umunna and I are determined to learn from this success. And I can announce that Mike Wright, Executive Director at Jaguar Land Rover, will now lead a review for us on how we can help strengthen our manufacturing supply-chains and deliver the skills and innovation Britain needs to succeed.
Following Sir George Cox’s review on short-termism, we will change takeover rules, and corporate incentives and reform our tax system to stop short-term asset-stripping and support long-term investment.
And why not use any revenues from the planned increase in the licence fees for the mobile phone spectrum, expected to be over £1billion in the next parliament, to capitalise the British Investment Bank so that, region by region, we can get small and growing businesses the finance they need to grow and create jobs?
And Conference, we will set up an the independent Infrastructure Commission, as recommended to us by the Chair of the Olympic Delivery Authority, Sir John Armitt, to end dither and delay in infrastructure planning.
We will legislate for a statutory banking code of conduct and demand real reform and cultural change from the banks.
We will legislate for a decarbonisation target for 2030 and unlock billions of pounds in new investment in renewables, nuclear and clean gas and coal technology.
And we will give the Green Investment Bank the borrowing powers it needs to do its job.
Conference, that is what the next Labour government will do.
So Conference, even in difficult times, even as we face a huge deficit, we will rise to the challenge and build an economy that works for the many and not just a few at the top.
And we know it can be done.
Because we have done it before.
Conference, we are not the first Labour generation to face a huge deficit and the need for spending restraint and a country crying out for change.
We are not the first generation to be awed by the scale of what needs to be done to transform our country.
And as we prepare for the 2015 General Election, to be held in the seventieth anniversary year of the end of the second world war, let us take our inspiration from the great reforming Labour government of 1945.
That past Labour generation faced huge economic and fiscal challenges. But they did not flinch. And they built lasting change: new homes for returning heroes, a universal welfare state, and a National Health Service which, sixty-five years on, is still a beacon of British values, Labour values – for all and not just a privileged few.
So Conference let us not be the Labour generation that flinched in the face of hardship.
Let us show we will not duck the great challenges we will face on spending and the deficit.
And let us build an economy that works for all working families in every part of Britain.
So in the coming weeks and months, when people ask what would a Labour government do, let’s go out and tell them:
Jobs for young people guaranteed.
Expanding free childcare.
A British Investment Bank.
Infrastructure delivered.
Green investment unlocked.
The deficit down fairly.
Tax cuts for millions – not millionaires.
Reforming our banks.
The minimum wage raised.
Our NHS saved.
Tackling tax avoidance.
Rail fares capped.
The bedroom tax scrapped.
Building the homes we need.
This what a Labour government could do.
Let us together make it happen.
Thank you.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much.
That's right.
Right.
It's a disaster because, that's right, in Pennsylvania they do it a certain way, and that would lead to many weeks after November 3rd before they're even accounted for, if they're even accounted. This is a terrible thing happening to our country where Democrat governors in, I think, virtually every case, they're trying to create a system of mail -- in ballots.
If you look at what's happened there in over the last little while, just over the last, uh, few weeks, elections have come in, small ones, very easy ones, and they've come in and they've been a disaster. They've been a disaster.
I think it's a terrible thing what's happening. People can get out and vote or you can do, what I call, a solicited ballot, okay? A solicited, where you request it because you can't be there for some reason. And you know, it's interesting, we voted in World War I, we voted in World War II, and here they don't wanna do it that way.
This is a terrible thing for our country, and they know it. The Democrats know this is going to be very bad. They know it. All you have to do is look at New York where the congressional district, a disaster. Look at Paterson, New Jersey. Look at Virginia. Look at many different that happened recently. Every one of them was just absolute... It was fraud all over the place.
Missing ballots, crumbled ballots, signatures that weren't there... It was a disaster.
Well, no. We're gonna hopefully accept the results, and hopefully the results are gonna be results... I think we're gonna win Pennsylvania by a lot. You see the crowd. It was a incredible crowd, a thousand standing outside. Um, I think we're going to win big. I hope we're going to win big, but you know, you never know when you have a -- a press that's as dishonest... Not you, by the way, but it's so dishonest.
It's so corrupt. We have a corrupt press, and people are starting to find that out. So, I think we're gonna win. I hope it's gonna be in the evening of the 3rd, of November 3rd, and you know, the mail -- in ballots, in this case of Nevada, they don't even have to have their ballot in until seven days after the election, and I'm saying, ""What is going on over here?"" So, um, we're just not standing for it.
We have two cases in Pennsylvania as you know, very big cases, and I think the judges will determine what's going to happen. They're very important cases. It's a terrible thing for our nation.
I understand what they're saying. I'm all for peaceful protests, but when you have anarchists and agitators and rioters and looters and everything else, that's different. But, you're right, Pittsburgh has had some peaceful protests. I'm all for that, but a lot of times the politicians cause, they say peaceful, and then you look behind or over the shoulder of a reporter like your, like you, and you see the city burning.
It's crazy, and you know, we can solve the problem if they'd call us. We'd bring in the National Guard. We would have, as an example, a radical left governor and mayor in Portland, we could fix that job, that whole city, in less than a half an hour. All we have to do is be asked. We have to be asked. You look at what we did in Wisconsin.
It was amazing. Very quickly, it's fine. You look at what we did in Minneapolis. Take a look at Minneapolis. As soon as the guard came in, it was fine. They should've called it two weeks earlier, that was the only thing. So, we have to wait for their call. As soon as they call it, we fix the situation very easily.
Well, I didn't see. I don't know much about The Atlantic. I don't read The Atlantic, uh, as a magazine but, uh, I can tell you there's nobody that respects soldiers more than I do. I respect them with my life. I've taken care of them like nobody's taken care of them. We've had three pay increases. We've rebuilt our entire military, and I know the incident when it was pouring rain and I was asked not to go by Secret Service because I couldn't take a helicopter, and I sent somebody else instead.
It was somebody that actually was a terrible chief of staff. He was way over his head, Kelly, but I know the exact circumstance, and it was pouring and I wanted to drive it, and the Secret Service said, ""You can't do that because of the roads,"" because it was a helicopter that was canceled. So, that's the facts there.
Nobody loves the military more than I do.
That's right.
Your governor has to open up. He has to say, ""Pennsylvania, you're open."" North Carolina, too. All Democrat governors, and I think what they're doing is politics. They want to keep it closed 'til after the election, and then they'll all open up, but that's a long time, two and a half months. It's too long, it's too long.
It's not fair. Restaurants are, you know, it's a wonderful business, but it's a tough business. They have to open up. The stores have to open up. The -- the... I have so many friends from Pennsylvania, they're devastated. Their governor won't open up. Gotta open up, you gotta open up the state, but there are other states too.
Michigan, it's a Democrat. Uh, you take a look at North Carolina, it's a Democrat. These governors don't wanna open up, and they have to. The commonwealth of Pennsylvania is great. It's gotta be opened up. It's gotta be opened up now.
They can open up slowly, but they have to start. They have to start. It's very unfair to people, and it's very unfair to the employees who are gonna lose their jobs. It's very, very unfair. They have to open up.
"
Justin Trudeau,"Good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us today.
Before we get into things, I have two pieces of news to share with everyone.
The first one is about the distribution of critical equipment to provinces and territories.
For the past few weeks, our government has been working closely with industry to produce the supplies our health care workers need like masks, face shields, gowns, ventilators, and test kits.
Well today, I can announce that our government has signed an agreement with Amazon Canada to manage the distribution of this equipment to the provinces and territories.
Amazon will use its wide distribution network to deliver medical equipment where it is needed the most.
The second announcement I want to make this morning is about the army.
We have received a request from the Government of Quebec for help from the Canadian Armed Forces for northern and isolated communities.
As I said earlier this week, our Canadians in uniform are always ready to help communities fight COVID-19.
I can therefore confirm that the Armed Forces will be there for Quebecers and for all Canadians.
COVID-19 has been turning our lives upside down for a few weeks now.
We are doing school work at home. We are limiting travel. We are staying at home as much as possible.
The pandemic is having consequences on all of us, but some families are going through even more difficult and uncertain times.
If you have lost your job, if you are not getting a paycheque, you are wondering how you are going to not only pay your bills at the end of the month, but also buy food the next day.
Across the country, there are food banks that can help.
Food banks and charities do incredible work for our communities all year long.
But like most organizations, food banks are facing new challenges because of this pandemic.
For example, most of their volunteers are retirees, who are more at risk of catching COVID-19. This means fewer people to serve a growing clientele.
With everyone staying home, they have fewer volunteers. And a difficult economic climate means that they are receiving fewer donations that they normally would while demand rises.
The staff at the Neighbour to Neighbour Food Bank in Hamilton told us that they’re getting more and more calls. And it’s overwhelming for the volunteers who are spread really thin and working overtime to help their community.
There is also Maison de Quartier Villeray, which I have known for many years, where people work extremely hard to help their neighbours in my riding of Papineau.
The work being done by food banks and their volunteers is essential, so there’s no question that they need more support during this crisis.
If you have the time and the ability to help, reach out to your local food bank and ask them how you can help them.
At the same time, I’m announcing that the government will provide $100 million to meet the urgent food needs of vulnerable Canadians, including those living in Indigenous and northern communities.
This money will help ensure that organizations can buy and deliver food to those who need it the most.
It will help support organizations you may already know like Food Banks Canada, Breakfast Club, Moisson Montréal, the Salvation Army, and many more.
And on that note, I do want to take a moment to thank all the volunteers and organizers.
Thank you for feeding our communities, we see you and we are grateful for the incredible, tireless, work you do even in these extremely difficult circumstances, especially in these extremely difficult circumstances. You are doing essential work for our most vulnerable. You are showing what it is to be Canadian, to be there for each other in times of difficulty.
I know that many of you are having a hard time right now.
The pandemic is creating a lot of uncertainty and you’re worried.
But I want you to know that our government will not let you down.
We are investing in food banks so that you can meet your family’s urgent needs during this crisis.
And, at the same time, we are providing financial support to those who have lost their job or their paycheque because of COVID-19.
We are implementing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which will provide you with $2,000 a month.
Our government is also supplementing the GST Credit to help low-income people.
We had said that in May, every qualifying adult would receive up to $300 with $150 for each child, but I can now confirm that help is coming sooner, this month, in April instead.
Our government has also been working with major banks to deliver benefits, including the CERB, through direct deposit.
Effective today, people should visit their bank’s website for information on how to enroll for direct deposit if they haven’t already.
I know that a lot of you want to know how long this is going to last.
You are asking when you will be able to see your friends, hug your grandparents, and have people over for dinner.
Last night, I spoke with the provincial and territorial premiers and we mainly discussed the sharing of information and projections.
The good news is, we are testing a lot more people and the experts have new data to analyze.
The provinces and territories are currently updating their data and will publish the latest information soon.
As for the federal government, we are working very hard to check the latest figures so we can post them online.
Please visit canada.ca/coronavirus for the best up-to-date information on the spread of the virus. 
I would love to be able to tell you exactly when this will end. I often talk about weeks or maybe even months, but the truth is, it will really depend on each of us.
The best way to minimize the impact of COVID-19 is to continue following the experts’ advice.
You know what they are saying.
Stay home as much as possible.
Limit non-essential trips.
And if you must absolutely go out, stay at least two metres away from other people.
Continue doing your part and I promise you we will get through this.
I want to close with a message for kids.
On Sunday, I will be holding a video conference focused on you with Dr. Tam.
So, send me your questions through the CBCKids’ website by the end of the day, and I’m looking forward to answering you this weekend.
Thank you very much, everyone.
"
Donald Trump,"-manufacturing back to the USA. We’ve been working on this for a long time. This is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus. It should have never happened. It should have never been here. They should have stopped it.
In the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries, take our business out of the United States. Millions of jobs were vacuumed out, just taken out so easily. Our politicians let that happen, and our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases to China and all over the world, countries all over the world.
Nearly four years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing, enact fair trade deals, and bring our industries back home, where they belong. When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security. We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for America’s medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs.
I just want to say that Pfizer just announced a little while ago that they’re combining Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, and the vaccine looks like it’s really heading in a very rapid direction and very positive direction. First time that’s happened, and they’re many months ahead of any other trial. There’s never been anything like it. So it’s the fastest ever. To me, it’s very exciting.
Today I’m proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of US pharmaceutical industries. My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company. You remember this company? It’s called, from the good old camera age, the old days, to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients. It’s called Kodak, and it’s going to be right here in America. So I want to congratulate the people in Kodak. They’ve been working very hard.
Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now, Rochester, New York, good place, and they’re trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal. They will be announcing this deal. I want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives. We’ve worked really well together on this deal. It’s a big deal. It’s going to be a great deal and a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak.
90% of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs. We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration by far. Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names, but cost much less. Yet less than 10% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs are currently manufactured in America. More than 50%, however, are made in India and China.
You’ll be seeing a lot of things that have happened. It’s been happening, but it’s happening at a more rapid pace right now. With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals. It’s a great name when you think of it, such a great name. Was one of the great brands in the world. Then people went digital, and Kodak didn’t follow. But now under very extraordinary leadership, they are following, and they’re doing something that’s a different field. It’s a field that they’ve really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company, watching over it.
But it’s a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States under this contract, our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act. Remember when you were saying I didn’t use it enough? I didn’t use it enough? Then now you heard it’s the 33rd use. We don’t talk about it all the time. We used it, and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren’t doing as we were asking them to do. It came through as both a threat and a usage, but this is our 33rd use of the Defense production Act.
Kodak will now produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is a big deal. Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost-competitive and environmentally safe. We’ll be competitive with almost all countries and soon with all countries.
Once this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we’ve opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25% of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the USA. That’s a big number, 25%. This agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak’s factory in Rochester, that’s just in the initial phase, and in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well. It’s a great place, and I’m very happy that we’re able to help them with the problems that they’ve had recently. The National Guard, I want to thank the National Guard, both state and beyond. I want to thank them for the incredible job. They went in and they did some beautiful job. They cleaned it up. You didn’t hear about the problems anymore.
Indirectly, I want to create … We created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains. We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also. I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boehler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible.
Today’s action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history. We’ll be able to do that through the Defense Production Act and other authorities. We have invested more than $3 billion in our nation’s industrial base. We’ve contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Philips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year, nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year. We’ve contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&amp;M, Halyard, Moldex, and Lidl to increase US production of N95 masks. We’ve brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we’ll have 160 million in a very short while, 160 million a month. That’s many times what we used to do, if you go back two years ago, many, many times.
We’re increasing domestic production of gloves by 1000%. That’s 1000%. We’ll be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year. We’re finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric. We have 13 million reusable gowns in the stockpile, and we’ll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed.
We made major investments in new rapid point of care tests. So there’s nothing like the rapid point, where you get your answer in 5 minutes to 15 minutes to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max. We’re already at about a 50% level, and we’re bringing it up very substantially from there. We’re growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month. There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close.
Through our partnership with Puritan Manufacturing in the state of Maine, great state, we’ve increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million per month now. As you remember, I went to Maine, I went to the plant where they do this. It was incredible. It was a great experience, and we’ll produce over 100 million swaps per month by January.
We’ve dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter. So we’ll have 500 million doses, and logistically we’re using our military, our great military group of people. Their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations, and they’ll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly. They’re all mobilized. It’s been fully set up. A very, very talented general is in charge. When we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It’ll be a very, very rapid process all over the country. Perhaps we’ll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we all of a sudden have become very good at making.
When the China virus struck our nation, we mobilized the entire government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies. HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns. That’s a lot of gowns.
Last week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States. Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens. As you know, that’s where we want to take care. We have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem, in particular heart or diabetes.
We’ve provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns. We have replenished the long-neglected national stockpile. In January, the stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks. Today the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we’ll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number. We’ve shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we’ve more than 75,000 available to deploy.
Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, and if you remember early on, when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by. Now we’re the largest maker anywhere in the world by far, and not only are we fully supplied in stock, but we’re helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get.
This is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history. We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world’s premier medical manufacturer and supplier. That’s what’s happening already. It’s been happening now for quite some time.
We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country. It’s corona-free, but we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida. It’s starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you’ll see it rapidly head down very soon. But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and for the most part, most of Florida starting to head down.
In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what’s been going on. We, as you know, have done an excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse, where they wanted to burn it down. There were anarchists, nothing short of anarchists, agitators, and we have protected it very powerfully. If we didn’t go there, I will tell you, you wouldn’t have a courthouse. You’d have a billion-dollar burned out building.
We’re also working aggressively to combat the virus in Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in tribal communities, and we’ve worked very hard with tribal communities. They’re very vulnerable to this horrible plague. That’s the largest investment in Indian country in US history. There has never been an investment that big in Indian country.
We need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease. It’s critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk and in fact, some age groups are at extraordinary low risk themselves, they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk. I ask all Americans regardless of background or age to practice social distancing, which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it. Remain vigilant about hygiene. Avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars, and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate.
Through the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before. We’re looking at a very powerful year next year economically. The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly, setting records. The numbers on retail sales came in two weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country. So we look like we’re heading to some very, very good economic times. That means jobs. That means stock market. Stock market is already doing very well. It’s getting to a point very close to where it was when we were hit with the plague. So I just want to thank everybody for being here. Steve, please, go ahead.
We’ll be doing a speech on Thursday, the main speech, the primary speech. Charlotte, they will be doing nominating on Monday. That’s a different period, a different thing happening, but they’ll be doing nominations on Monday. I speak on Thursday. Okay?
We’ll be announcing it soon.
Does anybody have any ideas? We’ll be announcing it very soon.
Yeah, there are, actually, and we’ll be talking about it. There are also things that I very much support, but we’ll be negotiating. It’s sort of semi-irrelevant, because the Democrats come with their needs and asks and the Republicans go with theirs. So we’ll be discussing it with Mitch and all of the other people involved. Kevin has been very active, as you know, all of the people involved. Steven Mnuchin has done a great job, keeps everybody together, both Democrat and Republican. We’ll see. We want to do what’s best for the people. I want to do what’s best with the people. I want to do what’s best for the economy, because that means jobs and lots of good things. All right?
I wasn’t making claims. The recommendations of many other people, including doctors, many doctors think it is extremely successful, the hydroxychloroquine coupled with the zinc and perhaps the Zithromycin. But many doctors think it’s extremely good, and some people don’t. Some people … I think it’s become very political. I happen to believe in it. I would take it. As you know, I took it for a 14-day period, and I’m here, right? I’m here.
I happen to think it works in the early stages. I think front line medical people believe that, too, some, many. So we’ll take a look at it, but the one thing we know, it’s been out for a long time, that particular formula, and that’s essentially what it is, the pill. It’s been for malaria, lupus, and other things. It’s safe. It doesn’t cause problems. I had no problem. I had absolutely no problem. Felt no different. Didn’t feel good, bad, or indifferent. I tested it, as you know. It didn’t get me, and it’s not going to hopefully hurt anybody.
So we know because it’s been so many years, from a safety standpoint, it’s safe. I happen to think, based on what I’ve read … I’ve read a lot about hydroxy. I happen to think that it has an impact, especially at the earlier use. There were some very good tests at Ford, and the doctor from Yale came up with a very, very strong testament to it.
There was a group of doctors yesterday, a large group that were put on the Internet. For some reason, the Internet wanted to take them down and took them off. I guess Twitter took them off, and I think Facebook took them off. I don’t know why. I think they’re very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it, that she’s had tremendous success with it, and they took her voice. I don’t know why they took her off, but they took her off. Maybe they had a good reason. Maybe they didn’t. I don’t know.
I can only say that from my standpoint and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. I don’t think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically, it doesn’t seem to be too popular. You know why? Because I recommend it. When I recommend something, they like to say, “Don’t use it.” John?
No, not at all. I don’t even know what his stance is on it. He was at the task force meeting a little while ago. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. It’s sort of interesting. We’ve listened to Dr. Fauci. I haven’t always agreed with him, and that’s, I think, pretty standard. That’s okay. He did not want us to put up the ban to China when China was heavily infected very badly, Wuhan. He didn’t want to do that, and I did and other things. He told me I was right, and he told me I saved tens of thousands of lives, which was generous, but I think it’s fact. Then I did the ban on Europe.
But I get along with him very well, and I agree with a lot of what he said. So it’s interesting. He’s got a very good approval rating, and I like that. It’s good, because remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us, John. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn’t have to be Dr. Fauci. He’s working with our administration, and for the most part, we’ve done pretty much what he and others, Dr. Birx and others who are terrific, recommended.
He’s got this high approval rating. So why don’t I have a high approval rating and the administration with respect to the virus? We should have a very high … because what we’ve done in terms of … I was just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody’s seen and the testing. At 55 million tests, we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I’d love to show you. Perhaps you’ve seen it, where we’re up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that’s just a tiny fraction of what we’ve done in terms of testing. So it sort of is curious. A man works for us, with us very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also, highly thought of, and yet they’re highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That’s all. Go ahead.
We’re going to work with a lot of people on DACA, and we’re also working on an immigration bill, a merit-based system, which is what I’ve wanted for a long time. That decision was an interesting decision, because it gave the President as a President more power than many people thought the President had. So the President is now, which happens to be me, in a position where I can do an immigration bill and a healthcare bill and some other bills. You’ve seen some of them come along. We’re going to do tremendous … We just signed it three days ago. We’re going to do tremendous prescription drug price reductions, tremendous. It could be over 50%. Whether it’s favored nations clauses or anything else, I mean, it’s tremendous numbers we’re talking about.
You go to some countries, and they’ll sell a pill for ten cents. In the United States, it costs $2. It’s the same basic factory. It’s the same everything. The United States bears the cost of all of these low prices that you see all over the world, where people go to Canada to buy a prescription drug from the United States. Not going to happen with me. It’s not going to happen with me.
So John, I think one of the exciting things got very little coverage, and that’s okay, but the people understand it. I think we will be reducing prescription drug prices by massive amounts, numbers that have never been done before. Other thing, in 51 years, we got, as you know, last year drug prices came down first time in 51 years that they came down. Now, with what I signed last week, I think that drug prices can come down by numbers like 50% and even greater in certain instances.
We are going to make DACA happy and the DACA people and representatives happy, and we’re also going to end up with a fantastic, merit-based immigration system. Please.
I didn’t know a meeting was cancer. Oh, a meeting with the drug-
Well, I said there would be a meeting. Yeah, a meeting sometime this week, yeah. They want to meet. I mean, I don’t know that it was canceled. They want to meet. I thought the meeting was actually scheduled for tomorrow.
I thought the meeting was scheduled tomorrow. Sorry about the dates. I see how upset you are by it.
Go ahead, please, Bloomberg. Bloomberg, Mr. Bloomberg. You look like just a Mr. Bloomberg. Go ahead.
We’ll do something. We’re going to take care of the people. Yeah. That’s a good question. We’re going to take care of the people.
Maybe it’s not, but I can tell you this.
She was on air along with many other doctors. They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine. I thought she was very impressive in the sense that from where she came, I don’t know which country she comes from, but she said that she’s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her. Go ahead.
Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
"
Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"I beg to move,
That this House has considered use of digital records in the NHS.
I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Wilson, and grateful to you and Mr Speaker for the opportunity to debate this matter. I am delighted to see my hon.
The issue of data is of transformative significance for the NHS. The health service has so many interactions with patients on a daily basis that it creates an enormous amount of health data that have a huge number of practical applications for those who know how to analyse the data correctly. With more patients being treated, more work being done on access to drugs, and massive breakthroughs in genomics and the study of rare diseases, the NHS must use IT effectively to digitise patient records and allow clinicians to harness the power of such valuable data. That is the essence of this debate.
My involvement in this subject area began through my late constituent, Les Halpin, who was diagnosed with the dreadful motor neurone disease in 2011. Les was one of the country’s foremost statisticians by profession, and a gifted mathematician with an inquisitive brain. He quickly realised that the numbers were stacked against him—when I first met him, he was absolutely clear that he had between a couple of months and a couple of years to live, about which he was absolutely stoical—and furthermore that the money spent on new drugs was widely out of kilter with the output.
Rather than take on the treatment of and research into MND directly, as that was already catered for by a number of non-governmental organisations, Les set his sights on tackling the system more widely. Understanding that the system he wanted to change was governed by the regulatory and political world, he began the Empower: Access to Medicine campaign. As a statistician, he knew better than anyone that it is information that furthers medical research. Empower taking on this debate is therefore the logical extension of his original work. Les died while on the waiting list for new treatments, for there had been no new treatment for MND for more than 20 years.
To my mind, there are three ways of deploying this IT effectively in the NHS—this is part of a wider debate, but it is worth mentioning here. First, with the right technology, data can be analysed for particular cohorts of disease sufferers to look for trends, monitor the effects of new drugs treatments and therapies and, ultimately, improve patients’ information about their own conditions, patient outcomes, and access to medicines or other treatments that are right for them.
Incidentally, we are seeing growing evidence of repurposed drugs being used to treat a variety of diseases that they were not originally intended for, with some success. For example, recent research suggests that some statins—drugs generally used to control cholesterol—can affect the treatment of brain tumours. Before such research can be turned into real treatment options for patients, we need to be able to use modern technology and digital records to flag where patients are receiving that treatment and look at the effects across a much larger cohort.
The potential offered by using IT to identify new treatments and trends could fundamentally change how the NHS operates. Indeed, the Science and Technology Committee recently reported that the value of big data to the health sector will equate to £14.4 billion by 2017. In fact, some consultants have found that efficiency savings between £16 billion and £66 billion could be generated in the NHS were the data deployed properly.
Once we start to use data, we can leverage the value of the intellectual property, which is created in a number of ways, by using it to incentivise GPs or clinicians to pursue certain treatment paths; by funding patient interest groups and other bodies; and, ultimately, by selling the IP to drug companies to speed up the development of new drugs. The whole thing then becomes a virtuous circle.
The second key benefit of IT and digital records is that they enable us to address the lack of co-ordination in the NHS. Clinicians will be able to monitor what is happening to a patient cohort for a particular disease across the country, rather than re-invent the wheel when approving treatment. Digital records will enable different teams to co-ordinate across one or a number of hospitals, synchronise appointments and ensure that all clinicians are fully informed of how their treatment is interacting with a patient. That should lead to the best possible outcomes for patients, and enable co-ordination across the health service.
Thirdly, patients will have more control over their own health information. In an age in which the use of medical self-diagnostic tools is on the rise, patients will be able to control—possibly remotely or at home—the data produced by the diagnostic machines; view it in whatever form they like; use it to inform their self-care; and feed it remotely, through IT, back to clinicians, who if necessary can modify the patient’s treatment. Treating people remotely will prevent unnecessary hospital visits and visits to clinicians.
Fourthly, once we start collecting data on patient outcomes, we will be able to drive processes within the NHS, identify things that are taking too long and work that is being duplicated, and ultimately save the NHS money on its day-to-day processes and tests. For example, we will be able to transfer huge amounts of data across different systems in the NHS. New patient tests are emerging almost weekly, which produce data that can be transferred across different parts of the NHS more efficiently. In those four ways, IT can transform the NHS.
Members from all parties, members of the public and clinicians have concerns about data privacy, and I would like to tackle that point head-on. I thought that some Members might be here to speak about their concerns about privacy and data protection. Some of those concerns are serious and legitimate; it is no use pretending that they are not. We all hear horror stories from our constituents about NHS trusts mishandling data, losing records and sharing inappropriate information. When this debate was granted, a member of the public contacted me to bring to my attention his experience of massive data breaches by one NHS trust, which is alleged to have consistently failed to adhere to data protection principles and to have hidden its failings from NHS England. Make no mistake: concerns about the handling of patient data are very real.
That member of the public highlighted that data protection breaches are regrettably already taking place. One of the purposes of this debate is to highlight the need for a national framework for digital records with built-in safeguards to protect patient privacy, and for genuine national accountability for trusts. We need to generate a debate on that subject. No patient record system is absolutely secure. Even the old-fashioned paper system is not absolutely secure, because it can leak: people can get into files, access the data and pass them on in an unauthorised way. With modern technology, we ought to be able to protect patient records.
Digital records may ring alarm bells with some patients, such as that member of the public, so it is imperative that the Government develop a comprehensive public information campaign on the enormous treatment benefits, which I have outlined, that health data can provide. We must convince the public that the benefits of the effective use of IT in the NHS far outweigh the potential obstacles and pitfalls that there may be along the way. We have the technology to keep patient data safe. A fear of errors should not paralyse progress on this issue.
There are some great examples of things happening across the country. For example, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust has done incredible work in putting together a patient registry of more than 99% of all cystic fibrosis sufferers. As I am sure all Members realise, cystic fibrosis is a horrible disease. Babies born with it cannot breathe properly and need continuous treatment for the whole of their often only too short lives. The first new-generation genotypic drugs are beginning to be introduced, and by using patient data to measure their effectiveness and possible side effects we can begin to make real progress on rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis.
The Cystic Fibrosis Trust operates a strict evaluation process, overseen by a committee of experts, to ensure that its registry data are used in line with patients’ consent. It is interesting that those with that debilitating disease realise the effect that IT can have and have willingly given permission for their data to be used in that way. That is an example of the importance of patient buy-in to IT patient records. Thanks to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust’s determination to promote and maintain its registry, we are seeing new treatments for particular strains of CF, which completely alleviate the dreadful symptoms that I outlined in young babies, who would otherwise die prematurely, and enable them to live a relatively normal life. Proper deployment of IT in a digital NHS would enable us to develop similar drugs for suffers of all sorts of rare and debilitating illnesses.
A shining example of what I am outlining is happening in Birmingham, where clinicians are trailblazing in this area. They are an example of what we hope will happen nationally. The University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust uses electronic patient records. Since 2011, all records have been electronic. Its commitment to innovation has allowed for some remarkable projects, such as Cure Leukaemia, which was established in 2003 to enable patients with blood cancer to access effective new treatments. In 2005, it helped to secure a £2.2 million grant to build the Centre for Clinical Haematology at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham. It resulted in the development of the second-largest adult stem cell transplant programme in the United Kingdom. The impact of Cure Leukaemia and the Centre for Clinical Haematology in Birmingham is closely linked to the distinct make-up of the west midlands and the fact that they use IT in the way that we propose. With a population of 5.5 million and the most ethnically diverse catchment area in Europe, the west midlands offers access to the broadest possible data pool for drugs trials.
Over the past decade, Cure Leukaemia has funded a network of 15 specialist nurses, who work across the west midlands and administer pioneering drug treatments to leukaemia-suffering patients. The combination of the west midlands’ unique demographic and the network of well-supported nurses has enabled us to leverage millions of pounds worth of pioneering drugs and give patients access to clinical trials for drugs not readily available in the rest of the NHS. Cure Leukaemia’s founder, Graham Silk, is also a member of the Empower: Data4Health campaign. Graham’s hope is that, one day, everyone will be able to benefit as he has from the amazing work being done with digital records in the west midlands.
The medical community see the advantages that digital records can bring to the NHS. The Royal College of Physicians believes:
“Fully digital patient records will bring benefits to the NHS, but to do so they need to be based on standards for the structure and content. Common standards are essential to enable interoperability between digital records in different care settings.”
“easier for care professionals to bring together a person-centred view of the patient from all the disparate records held in different settings and over time. They believe digital records will improve communication between professionals in different care settings and that it will be easier to drive timely, relevant automatic clinical alerts. They believe that digital records can improve safety by reducing errors in transcription of paper documents and they are of the opinion that it will be easier for patients to access their records for self-care purposes”—
something I have already outlined.
The second major benefit comes in NHS quality improvement and research activities. That is very much the key theme of my speech today. The RCP states that digital records could provide:
my buy-in point—
“and support for the development of stratified medicine which enables doctors to provide patients with specific treatments according to individual needs.”
The final benefit that the RCP highlights is the potential cost saving. With the NHS under increasing pressure, because of a variety of factors, the importance of opportunities to do more for less, while protecting patient outcomes, should not be dismissed. The RCP believes that the potential cost savings could come from reduced duplication of test orders and unsuccessful treatment, fewer errors and reduced time spent on searching for missing paper records.
I want to give a powerful example that really sums up what this is all about. Using IT and patient data to improve access to breakthrough treatments and personalised medicine is, fundamentally, about patients who are looking for answers and for some hope, not only for themselves, but for everyone in a similar situation. At this point, I want to mention a remarkable woman from my constituency, Christiana Knudsen. Christiana can explain her situation and her journey far more effectively than I ever could. If you will permit me, Mr Wilson, I will read the words she sent to me:
“The unusual aspect of my situation is that I am relatively young, midforties, and otherwise very healthy, sporty, have a positive mindset and have no cancer in my DNA. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a nationwide dataset of patients with ampullary cancer that could be used to cross-reference symptoms and treatments. This would, in my case, be a vital resource. It would not only allow doctors to help pinpoint the cause, but also make an informed decision on my treatment according to what has worked well with other patients who have suffered from the disease and who have similar attributes to me.
To conclude, effective use of digitisation in the NHS heralds the possibility of a complete transformation in how health services are delivered. This is one of those rare moments in human innovation when we could make a step change and deliver much more, for significantly less, on a permanent basis. We should, therefore, seize the opportunity with both hands, without delay.
"
Mike Pence,"… here in this barn in the Hawkeye State to look out and see this inspiring gathering. Small but mighty. Men and women wearing the uniform of law enforcement. Let me say to each and every one of you on behalf of the President of the United States, on behalf of your Vice President and on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you for your courageous service every day. We will always back the blue. You have a president, you have an administration that are committed to law and order and to supporting men and women who serve on the thin blue line.
But I also want to say, I know that here across the heartland of America, you’ve just endured some unprecedented storms and I know that the police officers and sheriffs who are standing before me today, and many that are looking on from afar have played a role in responding to families in the midst of this devastation. We grieve for the loss of three lives in two states. But I met with families today that have literally lost millions of dollars of crops as well and property.
But on behalf of all of the families that you responded to and once again that you went into harm’s way where others might have been running in another direction. Let me thank you for what you have done in these unprecedented storms for the people of Iowa and the people of America. Well done. And again, I just want to say thank you to Heritage Action. I know we’re going to be having a conversation in a few moments, but Jessica and Heritage Action are a bulwark of freedom and free markets, but I’m particularly grateful that Heritage Action would use their vast reach across this country to focus on that, which I believe is of first importance for the American people.
Security is the foundation of our prosperity. Our nation is able to be free and prosperous because people wear the uniform of the United States and serve at home and abroad defending this nation. But we’re able to live in the most prosperous nation on Earth and to run our businesses, to raise our families because of the thin blue line. Because each one of you ever done straps on a sidearm, puts on a badge, puts on the uniform and you count your lives as less important than ours.
I mean, it’s a humbling thing to think about. I love what the Bible says about those who bear the sword. You do not bear the sword in vain, throughout history, the good book says servants for good. And I want to tell you that as we were running for this office four years ago here in the great state of Iowa, and as we’ve served in this office every day since, it’s been a challenging time for law enforcement.
In the last administration, it seemed like a reflexive effort to blame police first and we’re hearing the most contemptible slander against law enforcement and even up to this present day. But I want to assure you that your president and this vice president know that the men and women who serve in law enforcement, you’re the best people in this country and you will always have the support of the American people.
But this is a challenging time. It truly is and I’m grateful not only for Senator Joni Ernst, but let me also say I’m truly grateful for the service and the leadership in a challenging time by the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Chad has done a remarkable job for the American people and join me in thanking acting secretary, Chad Wolf for all he does for America every day. I also want to thank, I want to thank Governor Kim Reynolds, who will be along directly. The support that she’s lent to law enforcement here in Iowa.
She’s really set an extraordinary standard and we’re truly grateful. Join me in thanking Governor Kim Reynolds for her great leadership during a challenging time for the people of Iowa. We live in a time when we literally have leading politicians that are talking about defunding the police. And as that rhetoric rises from even some of the leading democrat politicians in America. We’re actually seeing a rise in violence across the country in cities where the case for defunding is being made most poignantly.
And it’s remarkable to think as liberal politicians are talking about dismantling the police department as they suggested in Minneapolis, cutting NYPD by a billion dollars in New York, in one city after another Seattle, Portland and elsewhere. We also see a rise in crime. I pulled these statistics on the way here on Air Force Two. Atlanta saw 19% rise in shootings and a 9% rise in murders just in the recent days. Chicago’s seen a 42% rise in shootings. Philadelphia has seen a 54% rise in shootings and a 20% rise in murders. New York City actually just reached its 1000th victim with more shootings this year already than in the last two years combined. And 21 people were shot in our nation’s capital last weekend.
These are heartbreaking numbers, but I must tell all of you that they’re just a preview of Joe Biden’s agenda for America. The truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America. When he was asked recently about law enforcement, he actually described well-armed police officers as people that could become “the enemy” to civilians. When he was asked if he would support redirecting funding for law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, ‘Yes, absolutely.”
In fact, his new running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris absolutely said when she was a candidate for president that it was time to in her words, “Reimagine police.” I mean, the truth is these efforts of blaming law enforcement for violence in our streets, blaming law enforcement for unrest across America have got to end. We must back the blue and we must support law enforcement for the safety of all of our families of every race and creed and color.
There’s a false choice out there the liberal politicians are projecting. It suggests that we’ve got to choose between supporting law enforcement or supporting our African American community. The truth of the matter is we have done both. We will continue to do both. And with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, we’re going to support law enforcement and expanded public safety and opportunity for African Americans and every American of every race.
We can do both. And that’s why under this administration, we’ve supported funding through the COPS program to hire 4,000 new police officers on the streets of America. It’s also why this president in the wake of senseless violence that continues at this very hour in Portland, Oregon and in cities around the country, the president launched what we call Operation LeGend. It’s actually named after a four-year-old little boy.
It’s actually named a four-year-old little boy, LeGend Taliferro. LeGend was in his home, building a pillow fort with his dad. He was asleep that night in the pillow fort when gunfire broke out. Police officers arrived on the scene, they rushed little LeGend to the hospital but we lost him, but let me promise you. That little boy, little LeGend will not have died in vain. Operation Legend is going to save lives of children and families all across America. We will.
We’re surging personnel, surging resources, in cooperation with local law enforcement. We’re going to bring peace to our cities and we’re going to quell the violence and what’s the American people deserve. They deserve the support of law enforcement in their cities and that’s what you who serve in law enforcement deserve every day. So I look forward to our conversation today. It’s always humbling to stand before police officers and I never wore the uniform of law enforcement but my uncle was a cop in Chicago, Illinois for 25 years and I remember when we’d drive up from that small town in Indiana where I grew up and we’d go to Chicago to visit my grandparents, me and my three brothers would marvel as he walked out of his bedroom every day, wearing that badge, having that sidearm. We’d look up at him and we’d see a hero.
I just want to assure each and every one of you that whatever happens in the public debate, that’s how the American people see you. Each and every one of you, I truly believe with all my heart are heroes and never doubt the American people know it, we’ll always be grateful for the men and women of law enforcement. You’re in the prayers of tens of millions of Americans every day, and let me say to you, but just as much to your families who are gathered here today, thank you for your service. I promise you, we’ll always back the blue. Thank you and God bless you.
Thank you Devin. Great to meet you Devin.
Beautiful day, feels like I’m back in Indiana.
Well thank you for the question but more than that thank you for your service to America. Thank you. We’re eternally grateful, and it’s good to see you again. It really is. Well look, with regard to public safety, because on the larger question, let me just … I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president who has appointed more than 200 principled conservative men and women to our federal courts at every level who I promise you will uphold all the God-given liberties in our constitution from freedom of religion, freedom of speech to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. This administration is proud of the way we’ve been able, 200 appointees to our court with the strong support of Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Joni Ernst and we’ll continue to stand strong for all of those freedoms and all of those liberties. Including the freedom of speech. The right of peaceably assembling, the right as peaceable protest is as old as the nation, but let’s be clear. Burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not peaceful protest. People who destroy businesses and destroy properties and destroy statues will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Justice will be served.
I will tell you that in Washington, D.C. and I don’t have to tell the police officers here. There’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis and justice will be served, but there’s also no excuse for the rioting and the looting and the destruction of property that followed and that’s why President Trump took the action that he took in Minneapolis. He said to the governor of Minnesota, he said, “Either you quell the violence in your city or we will.” To his credit, Governor Walz deployed the National Guard and brought peace to the streets of Minneapolis. Acting Secretary Wolf will tell you, we had the very same conversation, after weeks and weeks, more than 60 days of violence around the federal courthouse in Portland, our administration spoke with Governor Brown and essentially said to her our federal officials are going to be there to protect the courthouse and to keep peace in the streets around it if you don’t and just a matter of two weeks ago she issued and deployed the state police to the region and deployed Portland police.
The violence has continued but the president has made it clear, whether it’s Portland, whether it’s Seattle, whether it’s Chicago, whether it’s New York City, we’re calling on mayors, we’re calling on governors to let law enforcement do your job and if they won’t let you do it, we’ll do it. We have the obligation to bring public safety and security to our streets.
Thank you very much.
Hey Todd, great to meet you.
Well thank you Lieutenant Perdue and if you just join me in thanking him for a great career of service in law enforcement. Truly grateful to you. When I was governor of the state of Indiana, I will tell you some of the most meaningful experiences I had was
… you, some of the most meaningful experiences I had was attending graduations from our police academy in the state of Indiana. You’ve been through it. And to see these young men and women step forward and to be willing to put on the uniform of no ordinary career. That’s why I hope all of you leave here, and anybody that’s looking on, know that whatever you might hear in the public debates from the radical left, or their defenders in the Democratic party, the American people are for you. They’re grateful to you. I hear it every day. I see it in the countenance of people. Every time that I speak about law enforcement … I know President Trump sees it in the faces of Americans every time he speaks about law enforcement. I just want to be very clear, the American people love the men and women in law enforcement and we are grateful for what you do every day, really and truly.
Now, that being said, I think you raised a very important question. Your first obligation and the calling of your life is public safety. And so, we’re going to support law enforcement to stay on the mission of public safety. Domestic tranquility is a central feature of the purpose of government. But beyond that, the other thing that’s wrong with the language of the radical left is one can’t help but think it is both discouraging courageous young men and women from pursuing a career in law enforcement. And similarly, it’s resulting in people choosing to leave a career in law enforcement. I actually read that roughly a month ago, because of the utter lack of support for NYPD by Mayor de Blasio, that they had to set a limit, a monthly limit on the number of retirements because they couldn’t process the number of officers who were applying to retire out of NYPD early.
I mean, that’s heartbreaking. That’s the largest police department in the United States of America. I must tell you, the world saw the character of NYPD and the New York Fire Department on September 11, 2001. These are the greatest people in the world. Many of whom lost their lives on that fateful day of 9/11. And yet, to see the Mayor talking about a billion dollar cut, pulling them back in terms of allowing them to go in and to deal with rioters and protestors, not allowing them to do their job is resulting in people losing a desire to be in law enforcement. And that’s a real cost to public safety and it’s something that we have to talk about. And I think it’s one of the reasons why I’m just so proud to serve alongside a President who backs the blue. I mean, and that’s not to say that there aren’t instances of abuse that have happened.
As I said, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. But, in my experience, nobody hates bad cops more than good cops. And the over … I don’t even want to say the majority, I want to say almost everybody that wears a uniform in the United States are the best of us. And all of you gathered here, that applies to. Your point is so well taken and I hope people looking on who are part of this national debate through Heritage Action will fight for America, will carry this message even more loudly. It compromises our public safety when we don’t give support to law enforcement and let you do your job. It also compromises our public safety when young men and women or experienced law enforcement officers no longer choose to wear the uniform. And that is happening around the country today, but that’s going to stop with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, okay?
Great question. Thank you.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
How old are your little ones?
Thank you, Jen.
Well Jen, number one, these are your boys here? This is your family here? This is great. Stand up. What a beautiful family this is. Wonderful. Three boys, you have three boys?
Okay. I was going to ask, because I’m one of four boys, so I respect you even more. Thanks for a great question too. Well, let me address that question by simply saying that we’re going to continue to stand strong for all the values and ideals that have made this country great. And I really do believe that the American people are with us. The President often speaks about the silent majority, but I think the silent majority will be silent no more. I hear it and I see it. I read a good amount of my mail every day that comes to the White House and I hear people all the time talking about feeling, in a very real sense, their values, their traditions, their beliefs are under constant criticism by the mainstream media and by politicians on the left. But I really do believe the vast majority of the American people are proud of this country, are proud of law enforcement.
We believe in faith, and family, and freedom and are going to step forward in roughly 80 days from now and support men and women that are standing for all of those timeless principles and ideals. I really do believe that the future’s never been brighter for this country. I mean, you think about what we’ve passed through as a nation. In our first three years, because this President rebuilt the military, largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And that means a special amount to me, because my son’s a United States Marine. And my son-in-law is a Navy Lieutenant and a pilot. And so, the investments that we’ve been able to be a part of and seen made have meant the world to us and made America safer.
But to see an agenda to cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleashed America energy, supported ethanol in places like Iowa, negotiated the kind of free and fair trade of the US MCA. Stood tall on the world’s stage. You may have heard today, for the first time in more than 25 years, a major Arab country formerly recognized the state of Israel, the United Arab Emirates, today. And it’s because of strong leadership, but it’s also been leadership on values. I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life, for religious liberty, and has been appointing leaders and jurists to our courts at every level to defend those principles. And so, I just-
To defend those principles. I just want to give you a word of encouragement. I truly do believe that if all of us will let our voice be heard in the days ahead, we’re going to solve the challenges in the time in which we live. We’re going to heal our land, and each and every day, we’re one day closer to the day we put the coronavirus in the past. We have a ways to go, but we’re going to continue to spare no expense. And to make sure that our health care workers, all of those that are struggling with the coronavirus and have the healthcare that we want any of our family members to have.
And can I just say thank you to the members of the law enforcement community. You’ve been there for families throughout this coronavirus pandemic and I thank you for your courageous and compassionate leadership in a challenging time for our nation. But I truly do believe as we see our economy starting to come back in the last three months, 9 million people have gone back to work, after we lost 22 million jobs. Let the American people know, that the strength of this nation is derived from our commitment to our national security to public safety. To commitment of freedom and free enterprise and the commitment to the ideals in life and liberties that have always been the well spring of American greatness.
And I truly do believe with four more years in the white house, people like Joni Ernst back in the United States Senate, we’re going to make America great again, again. For you and for these beautiful boys. Thank you.
Thank you, so much. It’s a privilege.
Well first, join me in thanking the Sergeant for his career in public service. We are grateful for you. And I want to say to you, Sergeant and everybody in this room. You have the harder job. They only shoot at me with words. I want you to know. Your President and Vice President are grateful to you and admire you and respect you. I’m humbled to meet you. I really am. And I love your question as a stepping off point, because we’re absolutely committed to doing just that. I don’t know if a police officer that I ever met that didn’t want to get better at what you do. And that’s the reason why in the wake of the tragic murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, President Trump signed an executive order. It said, we’re not going to defund the police, we’re going to do the opposite. We’re going to fund the police with additional resources so that you can have more training on the use of force. More training in what you all call de-escalation efforts.
We live in an increasingly complex security environment, particularly in our major cities. President Trump recognized that and said that rather than the defunding the police, we’re actually going to fund more training, more support for law enforcement. Combine that with the cops program, more law enforcement personnel on the streets, combine that with Operation Legend that I mentioned that will actually make federal personnel available to support local law enforcement. And that’s how we’ll improve. That is a false choice. The choice America has made the last three and a half years under this President. The choice you’ve made here under Governor Kim Reynolds. The choice we’re going to make for four more years is we’re going to do both. We’re going to support our African American communities, we’re going to support educational opportunities. We support education and choice. This President supported the largest investment in historically black colleges and universities ever.
You just heard Senator Joni Ernst reflect on my friend, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina. And he offered legislation, the President helped move through the House and Senate that actually is created more than 8,000, what are called opportunities zones in cities, across the country. They’re inviting investment in underserved areas and creating opportunities for people.
And I must tell you with that foundation I was just talking about of less taxes, less regulation and more fair trade and more exports, more American energy. We have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans in our first three years. And that we believe is the pathway forward, more support for law enforcement, for training, for resources, for personnel. A commitment to quell the violence on the streets. To make it clear to Governors and Mayors that if they don’t do their job, we will. And secondly is continue to support our African American neighbors, all of families in our cities to make sure that they have safer streets, better schools, more jobs and opportunities. That’s the pathway forward to bringing our country together. And making America great again, for every American. Thank you, Sergeant, thank you for that great question.
Thank you, Jess.
Jessica, thank you. Greatest honor of my life, to be your Vice President. God bless you all.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you. What a group of people. What a state. This was a big winner for us, wasn't it? This was a big one. That was a great victory. And I just want to thank you.
The governor is here. Doug, where are you? Doug? OK, come on, Doug. Look at him. See. He gave up the good location so you could have a good location. Thank you very much, Doug. And very much Kathyrn for being here. We appreciate it.
And you have a man who's here who's a special friend of mine. Works with us so hard on all of the tax cuts and the regulation cuts, and all of the things we do, your great Senator John Hoeven. John. Where's John? Thank you, John.
And, Mikey, thank you for being here. We really appreciate it. And Kevin is special. I have to tell you, I came for Kevin. I've been here for Kevin. I asked Kevin to do it. He was the one that could do it. He's the one you love in this state. And I said it's time. And I think you're going to do fantastically well.
And you know how well he's doing, he's really doing a fantastic job. So I just want to thank him for going into the race and, you know, you look at what he and Chris have done in a short period of time, they've really turned it around. And they're leading, I won't even tell them by how much. OK, I don't want to tell them by how much.
I don't want to tell them by how much, but he's doing great. That's all I want to say. Always assume you're down by one point. That's the best right. That way you work real hard.
I want to thank also -- thank you. I want to thank also Kelly Armstrong who is here someplace. Kelly, thank you, Kelly. Running for Congress. Also really out there, very popular, very outstanding person, and thank you very much. You're going to do fantastic, Kelly.
And Rick Berg, head of the Republican Party. Rick, thank you very much. Thank you, Rick. So we have a very simple, well-defined task. We want to have strong borders. We want to have low taxes. We want to ct the hell out of regulations. We want...
And by the way, we want regulations. Somebody, very popular guy here, was just interviewing me. You know who I'm talking about, great guy. And he said, what do you think of President Obama's speech? And I said, I'm sorry, I watched it but I fell asleep.
I think he was trying to take some credit -- he was trying to take credit for this incredible thing that's happening to our country. If the Democrats -- and I have to say this to President Obama, and it wasn't him, but would have been the same thing. If the Democrats got in with their agenda in November of almost two years ago, instead of having 4.2 up, I believe honestly you'd have 4.2 down; you'd be negative. You'd be in negative numbers right now. You'd be a negative number. We were heading south.
And you look at those bad numbers that were there in the last couple of years, it was this way, and going in the wrong direction. It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country since, I guess, to be totally specific, because I'm not sure they've gone any further, since the Great Depression, in '20s, it was the weakest recovery we've ever had. It was barely a recovery.
And now this is called not recovery; this is called rocketship, what's happening.
And today, -- today, numbers came out, and this is something that makes me happy. The numbers were great. The job numbers were great. The numbers have been incredible. Almost from the beginning. Took me a few months to get the engine started. And we did that with regulation. I mean, we did that by freeing it up. You had pipelines that couldn't be built. I immediately approved them. Dakota.
How about Dakota Access. That was a very unfair situation. And you know, I approved it. I -- nobody called me. They just built the pipeline, it's been working ever since.
Lot of jobs. It was very unfair. They got their approvals, and then they said, you have your approvals but you can't build it; you'll never be able to build it. I was told they'd never be able to build it. I approved it on day one. On day one it was approved. The same thing with Keystone. I approved Keystone.
Total of 48,000 jobs. But more importantly, two great projects. And we approved them both immediately, and you would have been stuck. You would have been stuck. You were never getting that approved.
And there are -- so many people thanked me for that. I guess more importantly, though, when I walked in, I was walking in with Kevin Cramer. And walking through the door. And a strong man came up to me, tough kind of a guy. And said, ""I want to thank you, Mr. President, for saving our country.""
And... and he had -- he had tears coming down his eyes. He had -- this wasn't just a statement because he had tears coming down. Unless he was a real wise guy.
But he had tears coming down his eyes. And he said, ""I want to thank you, Mr. President, for saving our country. And I want to thank you for all of the horrible things that you have to go through because it's so unfair to you and it's so unfair to all of the millions and tens of millions of people that voted for you."" It's true.
Thank you. Thank you. So -- so I really appreciated that. And it is. It's very hard for Republicans and Conservatives. We have a great judge right now being looked at, to go up and be the next justice of the United States Supreme Court. This is a great intellect. He's a great man. He's a fine person. And the way they are screaming and shouting and it's -- it's a disgrace to our country, actually. I don't know if anybody's been watching, if they're making fools out of themselves. And one of those people, I'll be running against in two and a half years. I'll be running against them and I look so forward to it...
...because we'll be able to give it back. So forward to it.
But the court system's very important. I'm going to be appointing -- and have appointed -- a record number of judges. We're going to be district court judges, we have Court of Appeals, we have Supreme Court, of course. And one of the reasons that it's so important to get Kevin in is just that. Because, you know, it could change very quickly.
And we could actually have -- you know, this will be -- hopefully everything goes very well with Judge Kavanaugh. He's -- he's central casting. You know, 10 years ago they said, ""He'll be a Supreme Court judge."" The intellect is extraordinary, and the man is extraordinary. But they were saying this years ago. I heard it even before I ever thought I'd be doing this, that there was a man named Kavanaugh who was extraordinary. And those are the people we want on the Supreme Court. And we have two of them. We'll have...
...him, hopefully. And we have Justice Gorsuch, who is just an outstanding -- an outstanding man. I'm very proud of it.
But we have to keep it going. If we don't keep it going, that changes. And if it changes, that affects yours Second Amendment rights. That affects so many different thing. We don't have to go into it, but it affects so many different elements of your life.
I know it's a big Native American population, and I know it's been very tough, and I know Heidi has not done a good job helping them and taking care of them, and they sot of vote for her because maybe they haven't had the right choices; maybe they don't the what's going on with respect to the world of Washington and politics.
But I have to tell you with African-American folks, I would say what do you have to lose? As I read a list of the worst things you have ever heard, highest crime rates, worst education, lowest home ownership. And I'd read like 10 items, and I'll never forget, they gave me a list; I was making a big speech. And I'm reading all these horrible things about crime and education, and home, and so many things, and I just said, what do you have to lose? Vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose? Do you remember that?
And my people all came up to me and, oh, you shouldn't have said that, you shouldn't have said -- why? The response was incredible. Why.
And I used it over and over again. And frankly, you know, we went way up. And now we've produced. Because now African-American unemployment is at the best number in the history of our country. Best number meaning it's at it's at the lowest in the history of our country.
And Asian-American and Hispanic-American and women, 65 years. But Hispanic, think of it, Hispanic is the best number in the history of our country. And Asian is the lowest in the history of our country. And I say with respect to the Native Americans, that I go right back to where I was two years ago when I was campaigning, what do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?
You put Kevin Cramer into that position and you're going to see things happen that you'll never see with Heidi. You're just never going to see it with Heidi. So I'll say, very respectfully, what the hell do you have to lose? OK.
So I have a list. And the list goes on and on. It's four pages of things that the Trump administration has accomplished in a short period of time; it's less than two years. This goes on, and on and on.
I have -- and, if I read it to you -- look at this. This is -- if I -- each dot is a thing. OK? And some of those things are very big things.
More than 4 million jobs created since the election, think of that; 201,000 jobs just last month, brand-new jobs. Wages are growing at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. And what happened this morning? Did you hear that? Two-point-nine percent, it's like the best wage number that we've had in many, many years. And that makes me very happy.
To me, you know, we had great jobs numbers this morning. They were just announced and they were fantastic. But the one that stuck out to me was the wage -- I mean, people are starting to be able to live; to live.
So not only unemployment but the wages are starting to go up for people. More Americans are now employed than ever before in the recorded history of our country, think of it. Today, right now, we have more people working than have ever worked.
We've created more than 400,000. That's very soon going to be 600,000 manufacturing jobs since my election. Well, President Obama said you won't have manufacturing jobs anymore, they're not around.
They're around -- because if you look at what I've done for your coal industry, it's incredible. We had a man who is in the mining business. He said, sir, what you've done for the coal industry is incredible because we were dead and now we're vibrant again. Where is he? Where is that guy? Where -- shout out your name, please. I signed his hat. Guy's probably loaded and I'm signing hats.
Hey, come up here. Get him up here. Can you try to get him up? I don't know. Who the hell knows who he is; all I know, he's in the coal business.
Come on up.
See if you can get him up here. He'll have to work through -- he's going to have to work through secret service. But who cares? I'm -- I'm telling you, secret service, he'll be all right.
Come here. Come here.
Does everybody recognize him? I don't. But he's a big -- he's one of the biggest. Tell them what you said about the coal industry. Do you mind? It's always very dangerous for me to...
Very nice. Thank you very much.
That's so nice. Now, I could stand up here and talk about coal for a half an hour, and I couldn't do as good a job as he just did because...
...Seriously, because he's in the business. He's knows. He said, you know, you -- we were dead and now we're a vibrant -- really a vibrant industry again. And you know, another industry that's vibrant -- it affects you a little bit less, but it affects everybody -- is steel. The steel industry is coming back like I've never seen anything because of what we've done.
We've done -- with all the dumping; they're not doing so much dumping anymore. But the steel industries are coming back. And you know, when they do dump, they're paying a lot of money on their dump steel that they're sending in here. And it goes right into the coffers of our country; and, that's OK.
But U.S. Steel is opening up eight plants, Nucor and others are opening up plants. Some of them are spending close to $1 billion on a brand new plant. The steel industry is one of the great things to be talking about. So the manufacturing jobs are back. They're coming back and they're coming back at levels.
Economic growth, as you know, last quarter 4.2. New unemployment claims recently hit a 49-year low. Median -- think of that, I mean, I'm going through them like eh.....No, think of it, median...
... Yes. Median household income hit the highest level ever recorded. That's not bad, right? These are some of the biggies.
American pensions have grown more than $2 trillion in value since the election. I said before, the African American unemployment the -- the best ever. The best ever, lowest number ever -- Hispanic American, Asian American.
Women, 65 years, sorry about that; it's -- I like history better, right? I like history better, right? Historic as opposed -- I joke, but -- but women it's 65 years. Best numbers in unemployment in 65 years, it's good. It'll be historic, I would say best in history very shortly, probably another two weeks. Youth unemployment...
...Youth unemployment, the best in half a century. Lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans without a high school diploma. Isn't that a great thing? I mean, nobody even talks about this stuff. That's like, you've probably never even heard of these categories. Those are important categories to me.
Veterans' unemployment recently reached -- its lowest in more than 20 years, and that's going up rapidly. I even think it's wrong. I think it's a much higher -- even much better than that. If it's not, I'll make sure it is. OK? I'll make sure because we love our veterans.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since my election, 3.9.
So Medicare. If you look at what the Democrats are doing, they're going to destroy Medicare and they're going to destroy your Social Security. We're going to save your Social Security. We're going to keep it. We're not going to touch it.
Did you see, when I campaigned, I was the only one that said we're not touching your Social Security? They'd say, how are you going to do it? I said growth.
We're growing faster than even I projected, although I thought we'd be around that number. Most other -- if I would have said it during the campaign, they would have laughed me off the stage -- they've been trying to do that for a long time. That hasn't...
...That hasn't been working too well, has it? And we're going to grow a lot faster. You know, the fact is, we're doing well. And you've got the 4.2s, we're going to go much higher than that.
Most people would've said 4.2, it'll take years to get there. Well, it didn't take years to get there; very quick. And last time, we were at 3.2 and everybody was shocked. I said it's going to much higher. It's going to go much, much higher than anybody believes.
You know, when we fixed the trade deals, that has a big impact. We're losing -- we're losing $100 billion with Mexico. We're losing anywhere from $25 billion to $50 billion with Canada, you know, even though Canada likes to say we have no deficit. They're smart in saying that.
They have a sheet out that it's $98.2 billion, OK? Their sheet, but they don't show us that sheet, that's meant for other reasons. They showed $98.2 billion. We're working on a deal with Canada, we'll see if it's good. If it's a good deal for us, if it's good for them, I want it to be good for everybody.
But we cannot continue to get ripped off like we've been ripped off before. Our farmers are very important to me. Our farmers -- and you're great patriots. Honestly, you're really great American patriots.
And it takes a little time. But China wasn't letting you in, for -- I mean, for peanuts. And the European Union has been very, very tough on you. They have barriers. They have trade barriers. They sell us but we aren't allowed to go in there. I said we can't do that.
And if you're going to do that, we're going to tax your cars because that's very easy. And that's the biggest money, the cars. It's all about the cars. That's the biggest money. And they're all pouring cars into our country and we don't -- essentially, don't tax them. It's 2-1/2 percent but for the most part, they don't pay.
You know, why should they pay? Why should they pay the U.S.? They're not used to paying the U.S. Now they're paying but it's only 2-1/2 percent. And with them, number one, they don't take our cars. And number two, if they do, their tariff is many, many times the amount that they pay us.
So we tax the cars. And as soon as they said that, they all say, OK, we'll make a deal. So every time I have a problem with any of these -- you know, many of these countries that we're talking about -- especially the big car countries -- I just say, OK, look, we can't make those deals. That's OK. I'm going to put a 20 percent tax on you because"" -- ""We'll do it! We'll do it! We'll agree.
We'll agree. I mean, actually in some countries, including Canada, a tax on cars would be the ruination on the country. That's how big it is. It would be the ruination of the country. Now, they've taken advantage of us for many decades. We can't let this happen anymore.
We have a country to run. You know the expression ""we have a company to run""? Well, we have a country to run. And when I get these horrible trade deals, these are one-sided, horrible deals. I think NAFTA -- I mean a lot of you people forget, but I think NAFTA's been the worst trade deal ever.
I actually think World Trade Organization was probably the worst of all, but a lot of people don't know what that is, but that allowed China to become this great economic power. And I'm a big fan of President Xi, but I told him, I said, ""we have to be fair."" We can't let China take out $500 billion a year out of the United States and rebuild itself.
We have some of these countries that are considered growing economies. They are considered nations that are not mature yet, so we are paying them subsidies. The whole thing is crazy. You know, like India, like China, like others we say, ""oh, they're growing actually."" So I want to be put down in that category because we're growing, too. We're going to grow faster than anybody.
And, you know, they call them developing nations. Well, we're a developing nation, too, OK? We are. As far as I'm concerned, we're a developing nation. They call themselves developing nations, and under that category they get subsidies. We have to pay them money. This whole thing is crazy, but we're going to stop it. We're going to stop it. We have stopped it.
And when we're securing militarily, John Kelly is here, General Kelly, he's great. When we're securing the wealthy countries from outside harm because we're paying for their military, I think it's fine, but they got to pay us for this. We're watching the whole world and they take it for granted.
For years and years we've been protecting these countries. They're making a fortune. They've had very little military cost. We have the biggest military cost in the world. Most of it goes to protecting outside countries, some of whom don't even like us, some of whom don't even like us.
I mean, we're protecting countries that have -- I got to say, they do have respect for us now, but they didn't have any respect for us, and they got to pay. They got to pay, you know, when they're wealthy.
Now, we are going to protect some people that need help, and that's OK. That's understandable. We all understand that, but when we're protecting these massively wealthy countries -- I'm not going to name them, but you probably know some of whom I'm talking about -- they got to pay because we're not going to be the protector of the world and lose a fortune and have our taxpayers paying while these other countries are living very beautifully thanks to us. Not fair, so we changed that around.
And by the way, then this idiot Woodward who wrote this book, which is all fiction, said that I said something like that, but he put it in a very crude manner. I -- the concept is true, but the way it was said was very -- you know, hey, I went, like, to the best college. I did lots of good -- I mean, you read this thing, the quotes were wrong. All these -- John Kelly, General Mattis, they were all writing, ""I never said that, I never said that.""
You know, well it's fiction, but they do put down the concept of I said that -- isn't that horrible, isn't that crude. Crude? You know what, I want to have our nation protected and I don't want to be taken advantage of like other countries in the world.
And you know what? They respect us more when they have to pay their bills, and they can afford to pay their bills, and it's going to make a big difference for our country. You wait. You watch. You see.
And so many other things. I could go help with the Olympics. We got the Olympics. We just got the World Cup. That's small stuff compared -- I mean, I must tell you. We opened ANWR, potentially the biggest in world, right? They've been trying to do it for 45 years.
We have a record number of regulations eliminated in the history of this country. In less than two years, I've cut more regulation than any other president regardless of how long they served.
And I think that might have been just as important as the tax cut. Regulatory relief for community banks. They were dying, the community banks. Now they can loan you money. Make a good deal, please.
We enacted all sorts of different elements for credit unions to come so they make it possible for you. My administration's providing more affordable healthcare options for Americans through association health plans and short-term duration plans.
We have all sorts of healthcare. We actually had it beaten, but that's a long story. We appealed and replaced -- but we'll do it. We had it done, but something happened. But we need -- frankly, you're right. Heidi's vote would have been great. If we had Heidi's vote, but she voted against it, but we got, if you remember, the individual mandate was wiped out. So we wiped out the individual mandate which is the most unpopular part of Obamacare. We wiped it out. And then I have three more pages -- two more pages just like this. Look.
OK? But isn't this much more excited than listening to President Obama speak?
Because we get things done. All of this, like the gentlemen from the coal industry, I mean, I've had that from so many people. I've had it from so many other industries. What we're doing for timber and lumber, what we're doing for so many other industries, what we're doing for cars.
Plants are moving back into the United States. They're coming into Michigan. They're going into Ohio. They're going into Pennsylvania. They're going into North Carolina. We have a lot of -- a lot of them coming back in, tremendous. And we have just started.
One of the things I wanted is I don't want our companies -- and I just insist on it -- I don't want our companies moving to other countries, firing everybody, losing these great companies and losing these great jobs, and that's the thing I'm most insistent on with trade deals.
We did NAFTA, our country emptied out. They still have empty places up in New England, these big factories that are all empty. They went to move to Mexico and other places, but they moved to Mexico. So I could go on and on. I've reached so many different things. We've started the wall. It's moving along.
Kevin is a big fan. Kevin's a big fan of the wall, and I just say this. We have so many things -- I will put it very strongly. You're second amendment is under siege. You put the wrong person in there, they're going to vote with Schumer. Look, Heidi is going to vote with Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. I always add Maxine Waters in there because...
But he's going to vote with -- we're going to vote -- he's going to vote with me. He's going to vote on making American great again, which soon... Which soon we're going to changing to keep America Great, exclamation point. Keep America Great!
And Kevin's going to be with us, and we've got the agenda for the courts, the agenda for the borders. We want borders. We don't want people pouring into our country we have no idea who they are, where they come from.
And you know, with these lotteries that we have, we have lotteries from countries where people come in through a lottery system. Do you think that these countries are sending us their finest? I don't think so. Now, they would say, ""That's a terrible thing to say.""
I mean, when I hit MS-13 and I called them animals -- they're animals -- Nancy Pelosi said, ""How dare you say that about another human being,"" you know? No, we have to be tough. We have to protect our law enforcement just like they protect us.
ICE is under siege and our law enforcement is under siege. And they want to have weak law enforcement, and basically they want to have crime coming. Look what happened in Chicago with a liberal mayor that had these stupid, stupid policies, but now he's not running anymore.
So that's fine, but, I mean, two weeks ago, 68 people shot, 12 died, Chicago. That's our country. I mean, excuse the crime figures because the crime figures in the United States are doing well. But you add -- that's a lot of addition in terms of skewing numbers.
But that'll get straightened out. It's easy to straighten out if you have the right policy. It's actually easy to straighten out. So we want to have strong borders, and that's Kevin. We want to have no crime. That's Kevin -- Kevin Cramer. We want to have...
We're going to have totally protected Medicare. We're going to protect our Social Security. That's Kevin. The Democrats are going to destroy your Social Security. As sure as you're standing -- they're sorry for no seats, but the crowd was bigger than they're supposed to be...
But as sure are you're standing there, they are going to -- they want to destroy your Social Security. We're going to protect it. Kevin's going to protect your Second Amendment, and so am I. But you know...
Things like that -- that's a very important thing. And things like that, they are under siege and things like that can disappear very -- very quickly if you don't have the right people.
So I'm here for Kevin Cramer. I want to thank you all for supporting him. It's -- it's an honor for me, because he's a very special man and I really said -- you really owe it to the country, you have to do this. You have to do this. We need that vote. We need him, we need his brainpower, we need his presence in Washington D.C., because that place is brutal. It's brutal. It's a -- a lot of bad, bad things up here are going -- going through people's heads. These are sick people. These are sick people.
I mean, the deceit and the -- you know, some of these Democrat senators, ""Oh Mr. President, how are you? I'm such a fan, blah blah blah,"" but then I see them on television 10 minutes later, ""We must get rid of this guy."" I said, ""Wait a minute, I just said hello to the guy 15 minutes ago, he's hugging and kissing me. He's hugging, he's kissing, and then he's talking"" -- these people -- it's bad.
I used to say, ""Real estate guys in New York, they're really tough."" Now I say, ""They're babies."" They're babies.
But we need -- we need Kevin there. We have to have him. So I'm here for him. I honor him. And I honor you for helping. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
"
George Osborne,"Good morning, and on behalf of myself, Ken and Philip, can I welcome you to the venue for our press conferences during the general election.
This will be the first of many such mornings we spend together here.
Today we’re going to talk about how a Conservative Government would get the British economy moving, by taking action on debt and boosting enterprise.
We’re going to draw a contrast with Labour’s debt, waste and taxes that risk pushing Britain into a new recession.
And, specifically, we are going to talk about our plans to avoid the most damaging part of Labour’s national insurance tax on working people and their jobs
And we’re also going to talk about our spending plans for the year about to start, 2010/11, and explain how they are connected.
We had to wait to see the Budget.
After all, it was always possible that Gordon Brown would recognise the damage that the full force of the national insurance tax rise would do to jobs and the recovery and the incomes of families – but he has not.
It was always possible that he would listen to the cries of business leaders, international observers and the rating agencies to make a start on dealing with the deficit in 2010, but he did not.
The Budget was empty.
There is no spending review for the years from 2011.
They have not even published the total departmental spending envelope for that year.
What we know is that Labour claim to have suddenly discovered that they have been wasting billions of pounds of public money in the government they have been running for the last 13 years.
£11 billion of waste, to be precise. As well as £5 billion of low priority programmes.
And we know that they don’t plan to do anything about this waste until next year.
So according to Gordon Brown’s logic, carrying on wasting money is crucial to securing the recovery.
We think this is wrong.
If we know the government’s wasting money, why don’t we stop it now?
Why don’t we reduce borrowing now, create confidence now, protect our country’s credit rating now?
Philip Hammond asked two of the members of our Public Sector Productivity Panel to advise us:
First, whether it was possible to undertake significant savings in government in 2010 without damaging frontline services.
Second, what were the steps that a new government could take urgently to find those significant savings.
I want to thank Sir Peter Gershon and Dr Martin Read for providing this advice.
Both of them bring not just impressive business experience, but also a very considerable knowledge of identifying waste in this government.
Sir Peter Gershon was, of course, commissioned by Gordon Brown to produce a major report on efficiency in 2004.
Dr Martin Read was until recently the head of the major IT supplier Logica, who was commissioned by Alistair Darling to produce a report on how to save on the government’s£35bn back office and IT budget.
It would be difficult to find two people more qualified to make the judgement about what savings can be made in 2010.
Peter Gershon and Martin Read have come back to us and told us that they believe that a sum of £12 billion pounds can be saved from the total of government department budgets in 2010.
Both say explicitly that this can be done without “reducing the quality of front line services”.
And they have set out the ways in which these savings can be achieved quickly, “with the right political will and managerial focus”.
Indeed, Martin Read believes that unless a government does this in 2010, it will not achieve larger savings in later years.
So the Chancellor’s own adviser says delay is not an option.
Philip Hammond will set out in more detail what both men recommend, and we are today publishing their advice to the Conservative Party in the interests of transparency.
Clearly, part of the £12 billion of savings will be found in the health service and in overseas aid.
We have made explicit commitments to protect these budgets, and so the money saved will be reinvested onto the frontline.
In the Ministry of Defence, we are conducting a strategic defence review this year and we don’t want to pre-empt that.  The existing plans for the defence budget will remain unaltered this year.
The other government departments together represent just over half of total departmental spending.
So we are expecting them to find, together, £6 billion of savings from the waste that even the government now admits exist – and which the government’s own efficiency advisers tell us can be found.
And let me be clear – not a single penny will come from the front line services that people depend on.
This £6 billion in savings – alongside the smaller savings we have identified by, for example, cutting child trust fund payments to the better off and stopping people with incomes over £50,000 receiving child tax credits – will be used to reduce the government’s borrowing requirement for the year 2010/11.
That £6 billion or so represents less than £1 in every £100 that the government spends.
Given the much larger savings that almost every business and ` many families have had to find from their own budgets in the last two years, it is not too much to ask.
No one can seriously argue that tackling waste is somehow going to damage the economy.
But from the conversations we have had with institutional investors and others, we believe it will make a start in reassuring those who fear Britain will lose its credit rating and restore confidence in our economy.
Identifying £6 billion of wasteful spending in 2010 is just that – a start.
We will hold this autumn the spending review which the Labour Government, with all their access to information, have so cynically refused to hold.
This will identify where larger savings and reforms can be made.
Some of the measures I announced at the Conservative Conference will take effect in 2011, such as the general pay freeze in the public sector that excludes the lowest paid million.
And we will have started by then to make real progress in reducing the size of Whitehall and the quangos by one third.
But identifying the £6 billion of savings in 2010 gives me the confidence that we can now say with certainty that we will be able to act more quickly on the deficit and at the same time avoid the most damaging part of Gordon Brown’s national insurance tax rise.
It also enables us to bring the share of dealing with our deficit accounted for by tax increases down from one third of the total towards one fifth.
As I said in January, this 80:20 split – 80% spending restraint, 20% tax increases – is what international evidence and the Treasury’s own internal analysis believes is the best balance for achieving sustained deficit reduction.
Labour’s National Insurance increase is a tax rise on working people who earn above £20,000 – roughly half of the working population.
It is a tax rise on almost all jobs.
The Small Business Federation calls it “an attack on jobs” that “will cause deeper unemployment”, and cost 57,000 jobs in small and medium sized businesses alone.
Quite frankly, it is the economics of the madhouse.
Gordon Brown talks about securing the recovery.  He is taxing the recovery.
He talks about creating jobs.  Well, the businesses that create jobs say his policies will destroy tens of thousands of them.
He pledges to make families better off one day, and then hits them with a tax on their incomes the next.
And for what?  To pay for the very wasteful spending that the Labour Government themselves admit exists.
Gordon Brown may raise taxes on working people to pay for waste, but we will not.
We will take his national insurance tax plans and we will raise the primary threshold for employees by £24 a week and the upper earnings limit by £29 a week.
We will raise the secondary threshold at which employers start paying national insurance by £21 a week.
Compared to life under Gordon Brown, every national insurance payer earning between £7,100 and £45,400 will be up to £150 better off.
The tax on every single job with a salary of more than £5,700 will be reduced for employers by up to £150.
Under the Conservatives seven out of ten working people in Britain will be better off than under Labour – and nobody will be worse off.
People on lower incomes will receive a tax cut – indeed they will benefit the most as a proportion of their earnings.
People on middle incomes will avoid Labour’s tax rise.
Taxes on jobs will be lower.
The tax system will be fairer.
Jobs will be saved.
That is the way to secure a recovery.
And it shows, as this election approaches, the choice facing Britain.
The re-election of a Labour Government under Gordon Brown – with more debt, waste and taxes – will bring us a new recession.
Labour will kill the recovery with their tax on jobs.
We will cut Labour waste to stop it.
Seven out of ten working people will be better off with the Conservatives.
Because we believe we are all in this together – and we need new energy and fresh ideas to get Britain working for everyone.
"
William McKinley,"To the Congress of the United States:
In my message convening the Congress in extraordinary session I called attention to a single subject -- that of providing revenue adequate to meet the reasonable and proper expenses of the Government. I believed that to be the most pressing subject for settlement then. A bill to provide the necessary revenues for the Government has already passed the House of Representatives and the Senate and awaits executive action.
Another question of very great importance is that of the establishment of our currency and banking system on a better basis, which I commented upon in my inaugural address in the following words:
Our financial system needs some revision; our money is all good now, but its value must not further be threatened. It should all be put upon an enduring basis, not subject to easy attack, nor its stability to doubt or dispute. The several forms of our paper money offer, in my judgment, a constant embarrassment to the Government and imperil a safe balance in the Treasury.
Nothing was settled more clearly at the late national election than the determination upon the part of the people to keep their currency stable in value and equal to that of the most advanced nations of the world.
The soundness of our currency is nowhere questioned. No loss can occur to its holders. It is the system which should be simplified and strengthened, keeping our money just as good as it is now with less expense to the Government and the people.
The sentiment of the country is strongly in favor of early action by Congress in this direction, to revise our currency laws and remove them from partisan contention. A notable assembly of business men with delegates from twenty-nine States and Territories was held at Indianapolis in January of this year. The financial situation commanded their earnest attention, and after a two days session the convention recommended to Congress the appointment of a monetary commission.
I recommend this report to the consideration of Congress. The authors of the report recommend a commission ""to make a thorough investigation of the monetary affairs and needs of this country in all relations and aspects, and to make proper suggestions as to any evils found to exist and the remedies therefor.""
This subject should receive the attention of Congress at its special session. It ought not to be postponed until the regular session.
I therefore urgently recommend that a special commission be created, non-partisan in its character, to be composed of well-informed citizens of different parties who will command the confidence of Congress and the country because of their special fitness for the work, whose duty it shall be to make recommendations of whatever changes in our present banking and currency laws may be found necessary and expedient, and to report their conclusions on or before the 1st day of November next, in order that the same may be transmitted by me to Congress for its consideration at its first regular session.
It is to be hoped that the report thus made will be so comprehensive and sound as to receive the support of all parties and the favorable action of Congress. At all events, such a report cannot fail to be of value to the executive branch of the Government, as well as to those charged with public legislation, and to greatly assist in the establishment of an improved system of finance.
"
Bernie Sanders,"If we stand together, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.
Yes, we have the guts to take you on.
We’re going to rattle their amnesia and force them to acknowledge reality.
And it’s a thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country, for the last 40 years, has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top 1%.
As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt, and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs, and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people.
Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous, climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51%. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36%. It seems to me that instead of building more jails, and providing more incarceration, maybe, just maybe, we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids.
What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have. Thank you.
Well, we’re going to win because first we’re going to explain what Democratic socialism is. What Democratic socialism’s about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one tenth of 1% in this country own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, that it is wrong today in a rigged economy that 57% of all new income is going to the top 1%. That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing healthcare to all people as a right except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that when you have a baby, we’re not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have medical and family paid leave like every other country on Earth.
Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden, and Norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.
Well, first of all, let’s look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November. 63% of the American people didn’t vote, Anderson. 80% of young people didn’t vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country. Democrats at the White House on down will win when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing.
Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much, and so many have so little? By which Wall Street’s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don’t. I believe in a society where all people do well, not just a handful of billionaires.
I mean, everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation. We have got to encourage that, of course we have to support small and medium sized businesses. But you can have all of the growth that you want, and it doesn’t mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1%. What we need to do is support small and medium sized businesses, the backbone of our economy, but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake, not just the billionaires.
Let’s also understand that back in 1980-
Let’s also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. Over the years, I have strongly supported instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole and I think we’ve got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchases. Also, I believe, and I have fought for to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal that can’t get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare because they don’t have insurance or they’re too poor.
I believe that everybody in this country as a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately.
Of course not. This was a large and complicated bill. There were provisions in it that I think made sense. For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, then that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don’t. On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gunshots knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.
As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton that all the shouting and the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing. I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus that said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with his gun show loophole that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the straw man purchasing issue and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally do something to address this crisis.
I think the Governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it. But, here is the point, Governor, we can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states. Whether we like it or not, our job is to bring people together around strong common sense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together on that issue.
It’s exactly about rural.
As somebody who has a D- voting record, I don’t think I’m pandering, but you have not been in the United States Congress …
… Check it out. If you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together, you are surely mistaken.
Well, let’s understand that when we talk about Syria, you’re talking about a quagmire in a quagmire. You’re talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting Isis. You’re talking about people who are fighting Isis using their guns to overthrow Assad and vice versa. I’m the former chairman, Anderson, of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war. I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country.
We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive, but I do not support American ground troops in Syria.
Let me just respond to something the Secretary said. First of all, she is talking about, as I understand it, a no fly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation, could lead to real problems. Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in a war. I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com, hear what I said in 2002 and I say without any joy in my heart that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization in fact did happen.
I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here and that is to support those people who are against ,Assad against Isis, without getting us on the ground there and that’s the direction I believe we should have to go.
Well, obviously, I voted when President Clinton said let’s stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. I voted for that. I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan. When our country is threatened or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country. I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral actions. Let’s work with our allies.
Pardon me?
Well, I think Mr Putin is are going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that …
Well, I think he is already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy and I think what he is trying to do now is save some face, but I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down. I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home. Maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation there.
First of all, let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways. Jim and I under Jim’s leadership as he indicated passed the most significant veteran’s education bill in recent history. We followed suit with few years later, passing under my leadership the most significant veterans healthcare legislation in the modern history of this country. When I was young man, I’m not a young man today. When I was a young man, I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam. Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war, but the policy which got us involved in that war. That was my view then. I am not a passivist. Anderson, I supported the war in Afghanistan.
I supported President Clinton’s effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. I support air strikes in Syria and what the President is trying to do. Yes, I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy. Yes, I am prepared to take it this country into war if that is necessary.
The scientific community is telling us if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we’re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis.
Let me say this. Let me say something that may not be great politics, but I think the Secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
The middle class, Anderson, and let me say something about the media as well. I go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people. Middle class in this country is collapsing. We have 27 million people living in poverty. We have massive wealth and income inequality. Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs. The American people want to know whether we’re going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens United. Enough of the emails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America.
Black lives matter, and the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she’s going to end up dead in jail, or their kids are going to get shot. We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system in which we have more people in jail than China. I intended to tackle that issue, to make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells.
Well, first of all, let’s remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world’s financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. That’s where we were. Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely, but the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. In my view, what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.
Well, that’s not true.
Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people. Check the record. In the 1990s, and all due respect, in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, “What a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge,” Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation. Today, it is my view that when you have the three largest banks in America are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail, we have got to break them up.
… is kind of naive.
Well, I remember that meeting very well. I remember it like it was yesterday. Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in, and they say, “Guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under. It’s going to take the economy with them.” You know what I said to Hank Paulson? I said, “Hank, your guys, you come from Goldman Sachs. Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem. How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country?” To answer your question, no, I would not have let the economy collapse, but it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street. By the way, I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax.
Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes in the future than they’re paying today, but in terms of education, this is what I think. This is the year 2015. A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago, and what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college. I think we don’t need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you’re poor you have to work, and so forth and so on.I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country.
When the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans for the so-called chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by, and I don’t know how they do, on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year, you don’t cut Social Security, you expand it. The way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000. You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits.
I didn’t leave anybody at the altar. I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery. Guest workers are coming in, they’re working under terrible conditions, but if they stand up for their rights, they’re thrown out of the country. I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason. Tom Harkin, a very good friend of Hillary Clinton’s and mine, one of the leading labor advocates, also voted against that.
I know that, but point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason. My view right now, and always has been, is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows.
Well, I was chairman for two years, and when I was chairman we did take action. What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A. so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines. The other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector. As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them.
It was 99 to one, and I was maybe the one. I don’t know.
I’m sorry?
Absolutely. Of course.
Well, I would shut down- I’d shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA. That is unacceptable to me, but it’s not just government surveillance. I think the government is involved in our e-mails, is involved in our websites. Corporate America is doing it as well. If we are a free country, we have the right to be free. Yes, we have to defend ourselves against terrorism, but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights.
I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined.
He did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that.
I have a lot of respect for President Obama, I have worked with him time and time again on many, many issues. But here’s where I do disagree. I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America, and do the things that the middle-class and working-class desperately need, is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say, “Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.”
What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest. We need to raise public consciousness. We need the American people to know what’s going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know. And when people come together in a way that does not exist now, and are prepared to take on the big money interest, then we can bring the kind of change we need.
I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics. I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire, who has raised substantial sums of money, and I do not have a super PAC. I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties, 100,000 people in this country, watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country.
Well, I will tell you this. I believe, and Pope Francis made this point, this is a moral issue. The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly. I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon. And let me also tell you that nothing is going to happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform, because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party, which denies the reality of climate change and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively.
This is a moral issue. We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia. The planet …
The future of the planet is at stake.
Yeah, Dana, here’s the point. Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby. We are the only major country. That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide paid family and medical leave.
Second of all, the secretary is right. Republicans tell us we can’t do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That’s not what the American people want.
I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs which has done an enormous amount of damage. We need to rethink our criminal justice system, and we’ve got a lot of work to do in that area.
The Republican party, since I’ve been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists. Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said, “Mo, no, no.” Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right wing Republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President, but the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together.
If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can’t refuse. If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, “We know what’s going on. You vote against us, you are out of your job.”
As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my list of people who do not like me.
This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems. We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country. We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and parental leave, family and parental leave to all of our families.
Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life. Jim Webb is right. Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs. We are doing it the old-fashioned way, 650,000 individual contributions. And if people want to help us out, berniesanders.com. We are averaging $30 bucks apiece. We would appreciate your help.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much. We're signing an executive order I consider to be a very important executive order. It's about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border. And border security will be equal, if not greater than previously.
So we're going to have strong -- very strong borders, but we're going to keep the families together. I didn't like the sight or the feeling of families being separated. It's a problem that's gone on for many years, as you know, through many administrations. And we're working very hard on immigration. It's been left out in the cold. People haven't dealt with it, and we are dealing with it.
So, step by step -- just like we dealt with North Korea, we dealt with Iran, we dealt with an economy that was heading in the wrong direction. We dealt with a lot of different problems. This is one that has been going on for many decades.
So we're keeping families together, and this will solve that problem. At the same time, we are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero-tolerance. We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally. With that, I'd ask Mike Pence, Vice President, if you'd like to say anything.
I think the word ""compassion"" comes into it, but it's still equally as tough, if not tougher. Secretary Nielsen?
It's been going on for 60 years. Sixty years. Nobody has taken care of it. Nobody has had the political courage to take care of it. But we're going to take care of it. But it's been going on -- it's been going on for a long time.
No, no, the border is just as tough, but we do want to keep families together. This is a problem. If you look at some of those horrible scenes from a few years ago -- to me, they were horrible scenes. They were just terrible. And that was during the Obama administration. Other administrations have had the same thing. We're keeping the family together. And so this is it.
And also, there may be some litigation. We're also wanting to go through Congress. We will be going through Congress. We're working on a much more comprehensive bill. A lot of good things are happening toward immigration, and proper immigration. But we have to have strong borders. And ultimately, we want to see it done right, and it will be done right.
But what we have done today is we are keeping families together. The borders are just as tough, just as strong. They can come in through ports of entry if they want. That's a whole different story. And that's coming in through a process, and the process is what we want. So I want to thank you all very much. I think this is something --
Thank you very much everybody. We'll get the wall -- we'll get the wall done. We'll get the wall done. Yes?
No, Ivanka feels very strongly. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it. We don't like to see families separated. At the same time, we don't want people coming into our country illegally. This takes care of the problem. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Caitlin. She's doing a great job. Thank you. Thank you very much.
"
George Osborne,"Ladies and Gentlemen,
We all share an interest in greater economic relations between the UK and China. And nowhere is that more important than in finance.
That’s why I wanted to hold this conference here in London – the world’s leading financial centre.
As someone who is a passionate believer in the importance of the UK-China relationship, can I begin by expressing my huge thanks to Premier Li for joining us this morning.
Premier Li – your passion and your leadership is driving radical reform in China.
It is a hugely exciting agenda that you set out in the Third Plenum – one that I am confident will bring prosperity and economic security to the people of China, and to the global economy.
I want Britain to play a major role in helping you achieve those reforms – and I look forward to hearing from you today about the opportunities for closer financial cooperation.
Yesterday, with Premier Li and Prime Minister David Cameron we spent many hours writing the next chapter in the story of the UK-China partnership.
We have seen historic agreements between our countries.
Agreements on energy – with multi-billion pound contracts for UK companies, and further steps towards a historic deal that could bring billions of pounds of Chinese investment into our new civil nuclear programme.
We have seen agreements on science investment and research partnerships – as two nations dedicated to expanding the frontiers of human knowledge.
But today we focus on finance, and the momentous progress that China, and the UK and China together, have made in this arena.
Modern finance is constantly changing.
But the number of historic changes in our financial world are relatively few: the emergence of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency after the First World War, is one; a second was the disintermediation of banks and growth in securities markets in the 1980s as savers sought higher returns.
And I believe the emergence of China’s currency as one of the world’s leading currencies will be the next huge change.
And, bluntly, I want the City to facilitate that change and be central to it.
In the last three years, Renminbi has overtaken 23 other currencies to become the seventh most used currency in international payments.
And that presents huge opportunities – both to China, who benefits from more investment, greater returns, and more diversification – and also to the UK.
We are the world’s leading financial centre.
And since coming to office I have been determined to make sure we capitalise on that position – and lead the way in this exciting new market.
In 2011 there was almost no offshore Renminbi activity in London.
Now we account for two thirds of Renminbi trading outside China and Hong Kong.
Two years ago we saw the first UK bank, HSBC, issuing an RMB bond.
Last year, with the permission of the Chinese government, we saw the first Chinese bank do the same. And now Chinese banks will soon be able to apply to set up wholesale branches here.
We have made huge steps forward – and I am hugely grateful to my Chinese colleagues with whom we have worked so closely over the last four years.
I have worked in partnership with my good friend Governor Zhou in particular on many occasions, and I look forward to continuing that strong relationship.
We are so pleased to welcome you today, and my colleague, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei.
Today we build on the progress we have made so far.
First, I am delighted that yesterday the People’s Bank of China, with the Bank of England’s agreement, selected China Construction Bank as the Renminbi clearing bank in London.
That makes it the first RMB clearing bank outside of Asia.
It’s hugely important in underpinning the future growth of London’s RMB business.
Second, I am very pleased to announce that UK Export Finance will now provide guarantees for transactions denominated in RMB.
That’s a huge boost for UK businesses looking to export to China.
This week UK Export Finance signed an agreement to commence work on its first transaction involving an RMB guaranteed loan, with a view to completing a major transaction later this year.
Third, I welcome the news that the Chinese authorities have awarded new licenses to UK companies so they can make RMB denominated investments into China.
Licenses will go to UK asset managers, HSBC Asset Management and Blackrock’s UK subsidiary.
This was a major outcome of my visit to Beijing last October.
And now that agreement is being put into practice, giving UK investors more opportunities to invest directly into Chinese securities.
And finally, I welcome the news that the People’s Bank of China will launch direct trading between sterling and Renminbi on the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.
Another boost to bilateral trade and investment – building further economic ties between our two great nations.
We have made huge progress in the last four years.
Everyone here has played a role in making the London RMB market what it is today.
And I would like to thank you for the many contributions that you and your firms have made.
And to thank the City of London initiative for all that they have done over the past three years.
But of course, what we have achieved so far is just the beginning.
And today we gather to work out what the next steps in our relationship should be.
Here are some of my ideas:
Firstly, I want to see the links between our financial markets grow further.
For example, Hong Kong and Shanghai are developing arrangements to connect their stock exchanges. I want London to explore something similar.
Secondly, we have already secured licenses for asset managers in London to invest RMB directly into China.
I now want us to explore ways for Chinese individuals and institutions to invest RMB into London’s global capital markets.
Thirdly, I want to see more British businesses grow in China, including in the very exciting Shanghai Free Trade Zone.
And finally, as Chinese companies go global, I want them to find London the most attractive place to set up their international headquarters.
But more than that, as Premier Li set out last night, I want UK and Chinese companies to be working together in third countries.
Because that is the true sign of a successful partnership.
These are just some of my thoughts, but there will be many others discussed at this conference.
It’s a hugely exciting agenda, where the future belongs to those ambitious for reform.
Let me be clear.
Our long term economic plan is working, but the job isn’t done.
We need to export to fast growing economies like China, and attract more investment to our shores.
To do that we need to make sure China’s currency, as it emerges onto the world stage, is used and traded here – as that will not only be good for China, but good for UK jobs and investment too.
Together – the people here in this room – we’ll work to make that happen.

George Washington,"Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: In meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public Affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our Country with plenty, and with the means of a flourishing commerce. The progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American Stock abroad as well as at home. And the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes, have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources, but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add, as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our Citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary. 
In conforming to the powers vested in me by acts of the last Session, a loan of three millions of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place, has been completed in Holland. As well the celerity with which it has been filled, as the nature of the terms, (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) gives a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The Secretary of the Treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information. 
Since your last Sessions, I have received communications by which it appears, that the District of Kentucky, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that State; in consequence of which the District is to become a distinct member of the Union, in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony, with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties; and the sentiments of warm attachment to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow citizens of Kentucky cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you. 
It has been heretofore known to Congress, that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the North West side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane overtures92 made on the part of the United States, renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable Citizens have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking; whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity. 
These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the Western Settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the Government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the Act, which empowers the President to call out the Militia for the protection of the frontiers. And I have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of Militia as were deemed sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended. 
The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war, among the Nations most concerned in active Commerce with this Country, to abridge the means, and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflexion how far and in what mode, it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies, by such encouragements to our own Navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries, and the transportation of our own produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil. 
Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it distressful to us, that you will not think any deliberations misemployed, which may lead to its relief and protection. 
The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a Judiciary System have opened the doors of Justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom, whether improvements in that system may yet be made; and particularly whether a uniform process of execution on sentences issuing, from the federal Courts be not desireable through all the states. 
The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and Seamen, has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign Countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that Jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them, either by express Convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the national authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect. 
The establishment of the Militia; of a mint; of Standards of weights and measures; of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own importance. 
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The sufficiency of the Revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me, moreover, to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the Interest of the debt funded, but, as far and as fast as [the] growing resources of the Country will permit, to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the Western Lands explains your dispositions on this subject: And I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more salutary will the measure be to every public interest, as well as the more satisfactory to our Constituents. 
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: In pursuing the various and weighty business of the present Session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by the love of your Country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both, and our best reward, if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established Government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow Citizens, and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.
"
Donald Trump,"For 17 months, I've traveled this country and met countless Americans from every walk of life. Your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams.
I've been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make America great again.
Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing Obamacare -- Americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof.
It also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed American jobs and crushed American incomes. This means renegotiating Bill and Hillary Clinton's disastrous NAFTA and China deals that have deindustrialized the United States -- importing unemployment and exporting our wealth.
It means we don't have to keep kids trapped in failing schools -- that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed for generations by Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton.
Real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington. We must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. If we want to make America great again, we must clean up this corruption.
Hillary Clinton has been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation into many crimes against this nation. Were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis -- Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt.
America has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation.
It is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people.
That's what I'm offering in my Contract with the American Voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to Washington. It's there for you to read at www. TheTrumpContract.com.
In my Contract with the American Voter, I offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. We will cut taxes on middle-class Americans by 35%. We will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. We will repeal and replace catastrophic Obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. And we will end the offshoring of American jobs.
In my contract, I also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary has pledged ""open borders,"" mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. America's immigration officers described Hillary's extremist plan as ""the most radical immigration agenda proposal in U.S. history.""
I will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same.
Finally, I pledge to fight for the right of every child in American to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities.
I am asking for your vote, and to be your champion in the White House.
Together, we will take our government back from the special interests -- and we will Make America Great Again.
"
Dominic Raab,"Further to the oral statement made by the Defence Secretary on 7 January, I will make a statement on Iran in response to the urgent question from my right hon. Friend.
Let me first express my condolences, and those of the Government, to the loved ones of those who tragically lost their lives on Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752. Our thoughts are with all those affected during what must be a devastating time. Among the 176 passengers who tragically lost their lives were four British nationals, as well as 82 Iranians.
On 9 January we stated publicly—alongside partners such as Canada and the United States—that, given an increasing body of information, we believed that Iran was responsible for the downing of the aircraft. Despite initial denials, the Government of Iran acknowledged on 11 January that they were responsible. Now it is time for a full, transparent and independent investigation. It must be a collaborative endeavour, with a strong international component. The families of the victims—including those in Iran—must have answers, and must know the truth. The UK is also working with the Canadian-led International Coordination and Response Group, consisting of countries with nationals killed in the plane crash. The group will help with the issuing of visas and the repatriation of the bodies of the victims.
Separately, Her Majesty’s ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, was arrested over the weekend, and was illegally held for three hours. On 11 January, the ambassador attended a public vigil to pay his respects to the victims of flight 752. He left shortly afterwards, when there were signs that the vigil might turn into a protest. Let me be very clear about this: he was not attending or recording a political protest or demonstration. His arrest later that day, without grounds or explanation, was a flagrant violation of international law. Today, in response, we will summon the Iranian ambassador to demand an apology, and to seek full assurances that this will not happen again.
Given the treatment of the ambassador, we are keeping security measures for the embassy under review, and, as I am sure the House would expect, we updated our travel advice on 10 January. We currently recommend that British nationals should not travel to Iran or take any flights to, from or within Iran. On the diplomatic front, in the past week I have met our international partners in Brussels, Washington and Montreal, and I attended an E3 meeting yesterday in Paris. I spoke to Foreign Minister Zarif on 6 January, and the Prime Minister spoke to President Rouhani on 9 January. We welcome the overwhelming international support for Her Majesty’s ambassador to Iran, and for the rights to which all diplomats are entitled under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. The regime in Tehran is at a crossroads, and it can slip further and further into political and economic isolation, but there is an alternative. The regime does have a choice. The diplomatic door remains open, and now is the time for Iran to engage in diplomacy and chart a peaceful way forward. I commend this statement to the House.
"
Donald Trump,"Many people are asking me what do I think of Libya, and it's so-called newfound freedom. The fact is what we should have done is we should have asked the rebels when they came to us and they came to us, they were being routed by Qadhafi. They were being decimated, we should have said we'll help you, but we want 50 percent of your oil, they would have absolutely said okay, a hundred percent.
In fact, they would have said how about seventy five percent. So they came to us, they were nothing, they were gone, the war was over. He was taking over then all of a sudden we go in through NATO, which is funded by us largely and which is largely our weapons and our guys we go in and absolutely decimate this guy they take over.
And now you ask for oil, you know what, they're going to do the same thing that OPEC does, they're gonna rip us off like you've never seen before. They're gonna charge us so much. Our economy is broke, our country is broke.
We're spending billions and billions on the so-called rebels that aren't even our friends. You watch what happens, they'll turn against us as soon as they have somebody else like Iran and isn't it sad. We could have had anything we wanted, we could have had 50% of those oil fields.
You know the old days when you had a war, it's to the victor belong the spoils. We have wars with Iraq, with Afghanistan we spend trillions of dollars. We get nothing, absolutely nothing and those countries are falling apart the day we leave it's over.
So we could have had something special when the so-called rebels came to us, we should have said, fellas, we're gonna help you. We want 50% of your oil. They would have said thank you very much.
We have a deal, write it down, sign it. We have a deal. We would have been a rich nation again, they have tremendous oil reserves in instead we help we get nothing.
We're very, very foolishly led. Our leaders unfortunately are.
"
Donald Trump,"I would like to introduce, first, the mayor. He's going to say a few words. Then I will say a few words. We were treated so nicely. We learned so much in such a quick period of time. But the mayor has done a fantastic job. Mr. Mayor.
Thank you, Pete. Thank you very much.
. It's been an amazing experience. Mexico is booming, absolutely booming. And Jesus, the city manager, and Pete have done an amazing job right here.
But a lot of what's happening here is because of the fact that Mexico is doing so well. It's just doing beyond -- beyond what anybody ever thought. And I don't know if that's good for the United States, but it's good for Mexico. Anybody have any questions?
Yes, I think we will win the Hispanic vote. I have thousands of Mexicans and Hispanics. And I think when it comes right down -- I don't know if you saw the poll, but they just did a big poll in Nevada, the state of Nevada. And I'm way ahead. And more importantly as far as I'm concerned, I'm way, way ahead with the Hispanics, well into the 30s, which -- and I think second is like 11.
So I have a great relationship. Over the years, thousands and thousands of Hispanics have worked for me and now work for me. And the relationship is very good. Question.
How many people killed?
Yes.
I agree with that. No, I agree with that. And they come through here. But they come from all over the world. I agree with that.
There's great danger with the illegals. And we're just discussing that. But we have a tremendous danger on the border with the illegals coming in. Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I have. And I have heard it. And I have heard it from a lot of different people. And, in fact, as you know, the Border Patrol was the one that invited me. I think most of you have that invitation. We sent it. The Border Patrol invited me. And then they canceled, because, frankly, they don't want to get involved. They know the problem.
The reason they invited me was because of the tremendous problem and the tremendous crime and all of the things that you're talking about. So, they invited me. And then, at the last moment I mean, we were virtually in the air and they said, we can't get involved. And I heard they got those orders from Washington.
We will be showing you the evidence.
Well, you know, I have -- we just landed and there were a lot of people at the airport. And they were all waving American flags and they were all in favor of Trump and what I'm doing, and virtually everyone that we saw. There was such a great, warm -- I was actually surprised. But there was such great warmth at the airport with all of those people that were there. So, we're very, very honored. Yes, go ahead.
No, they were chanting for me.
I didn't see that.
Well, I think meeting the mayor and meeting Jesus, the city manager. I think these are tremendous people. They're doing a tremendous job. Come on, Jesus. Say a word. This man -- I'm going to steal him to run something for me. He's fantastic, the city manager.
No, no, not at all. There are different sections. This is one section, but there are different sections.
Well, the one thing you have to do, and as Jesus was saying and as the mayor was saying, there is a huge problem with the illegals coming through. And in this section, it's a problem. In some sections, it's a massive problem. And you have to do -- you have to create -- you have to make the people that come in, they have to be legal. Very simple.
You have to let people do their job, the Border Patrols, which, by the way, it seems the unions are very much involved with the Border Patrols. But have to let them do their job. They want to do their job. That's why they invited me, that they invited me. I didn't come here. The Border Patrols invited me because they have got such a problem. They want to be able to do their job. If they can't do their job, believe me, they're unhappy. They want to be able to do their job.
Yes, in certain sections, you have to have a wall, absolutely. And, by the way, the wall -- the wall will save you a tremendous amount of money. But you absolutely -- there are areas that you have to have the wall.
The who?
I don't know anything about it.
No, they weren't insulted, because the press misinterprets my words.
The first thing we have to do is strengthen our borders. And after that, we're going to have plenty of time to talk about it. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
"
Yvette Cooper,"Conference,
Last week I talked to a mother in my constituency.
Her daughter Ellis is 16.
She got her GCSEs this summer. Her mum said she worked really hard.
She was due to start an apprenticeship this September at a local nursery school.
In August they told her the coalition Government has cut the funding.
Her mum was told Ellis can still do her training.
But only if she forks out £1,200. That’s £1,200 she and her family haven’t got.
Conference this is the Britain David Cameron and Nick Clegg want to build.
Hopes betrayed.
Ambitions abandoned.
Young people left to sink or swim.
Unless you can afford to pay yourself.
This is what the Big Society really means.
And this is why, for Ellis and thousands like her, we have to fight to get the Labour Party back into Government as soon as we possibly can.
And that is why we need to come together now, behind our new leader, Ed Miliband, who will lead us in:
– exposing the madness of the Tories’ attack on jobs,
– challenging the deep unfairness of their plans,
– and fighting the biggest assault on families in any of our lifetimes.
Conference, throughout our history the Labour Party has fought for jobs.
Remember as recession started, economists said unemployment would reach 3 million.
That is what happened in the Tory recessions of the 80s and 90s.
But this party vowed we would not let that happen again.
Government, businesses, unions , councils, voluntary groups all pulled together.
Backing jobs building new schools and homes.
Guaranteed work or training for young people.
Working together to keep Britain working.
Look at the results.
The dole queue started coming down last autumn.
Far earlier than in any other recession.
Far below the 3 million predicted.
One and a half million fewer people on the dole than in the 80s and 90s recession.
One and a half million more people in work supporting their families. That is Labour’s achievement and this party should be proud of it.
And Conference I saw the pressures Labour’s Chancellor faced, the decisions Alistair and Gordon took, that:
– stopped banks crashing,
– stopped millions of people losing their savings,
– saved jobs.
Conference we should pay tribute now to Gordon and Alistair for the work they did for this country.
Over the summer, the world economy ha s slipped back into more dangerous waters.
In Ireland the sharp austerity drive has triggered a double dip recession.
Here at home private sector job growth is still too weak.
Vacancies have dropped in the last three months.
And the number of people on the dole has gone up for the first time since January.
So what is David Cameron’s answer?
To cut jobs just when we need them most.
George Osborne’s own Budget said 100,000 more people on the dole each and every year, just as a result of the decisions they made.
Over the next few years, Treasury’s own papers show:
– Half a million jobs lost in the public sector,
– Over half a million jobs lost in the private sector,
– Half a million fewer jobs and opportunities for the unemployed.
So what do ministers have to say to the 90,000 young people now being denied a job on the Future Jobs Fund.
David Cameron said the Future Jobs Fund was “a g ood scheme” and “good schemes we will keep”.
But he didn’t keep it. He abolished it.
Nick Clegg was asked whether these job cuts were fair. He said “of course it isn’t…. It’s a decision taken by the local council.”
But Nick, it wasn’t a council decision, it was a decision announced by a Liberal Democrat Government Minister.
Doesn’t this tell you everything you need to know about this coalition.
David Cameron tells people whatever they want to hear.
Nick Clegg tells them it’s someone else’s fault.
And we in the Labour Party must make sure every conceit and every deceit is exposed for what it is – a betrayal of young people across Britain.
And what reason do they give for cutting so many jobs?
They say they need to do this to get the deficit down.
Conference, of course the deficit does need to come back down. And that will mean some tough and unpopular decisions.
But cutting jobs to get the deficit down?
More people on the dole to bring the deficit down?
What planet are they on?
We’ve heard the Tories say this before.
In the 90s they told us that “unemployment is a price worth paying to bring inflation down”.
20 years later they are telling us again unemployment is a price worth paying to bring the deficit down.
Both times they were badly wrong.
Unemployment is never a price worth paying.
Rising unemployment pushes the deficit up not down.
Every 100,000 people on the dole costs us £700 million in lower tax and higher benefits.
Unemployment isn’t the price of bringing the deficit down.
Higher unemployment means we all will pay a higher price.
Nick Clegg claims the public finances are like a household budget, and we have to cut back quick.
But think about it. Because this is a family with a choice to make.
It’s a family with a mortgage who cut the rep ayments when dad lost his job in the recession – to make sure they could get by til he found work, and to make sure the family didn’t lose their home.
And now they have a choice.
Make good those repayments steadily, bit by bit. Go for some extra overtime or promotion, tighten their belts a little. But spread the payments sensibly.
Or follow the George Osborne plan. Pay it off all at once. Sell the furniture, the car that gets mum to work, sell the dog, even the house itself – whatever it takes to get the debt down.
The truth is that every family knows cutting back too far too fast causes deep damage and ends up costing you far, far more.
Unemployment won’t get the deficit down, more people in jobs will get the deficit down.
Conference, our task is getting more people into work
That means supporting jobs and yes it also means going further on welfare reform too.
We brought in extra help and stronger rules. We cut the numb er of people stuck on out of work benefits. But we need to go further.
We know from the doorstep, we talked to parents worried about whether their children could find work, neighbours worried that other people weren’t playing by the rules.
We should have started sooner on reforms to help people off long term sickness benefits and into work.
And we should go further to guarantee more jobs, but to require more people to take them up.
Opportunities alongside obligations.
But that’s not what this coalition is doing.
Iain Duncan Smith says he wants more people in work.
But George Osborne is cutting jobs for them to go to.
Iain Duncan Smith says he wants people to be better off in work.
But George Osborne cut working tax credit.
Iain Duncan Smith says he wants more conditions on claimants.
But the Government is ending the requirement for young people to take work.
Iain Duncan Smith says a lot. But no one else in Government seems to be listening.
He said himself, he was the quiet man.
So quiet no one else can hear.
They’re not setting out welfare reforms to help people into work. They’re just setting out old fashioned cuts that hit the poorest hardest.
George Osborne is swaggering round like the playground bully – working out who won’t fight back, picking on the weakest – and that’s just Iain Duncan Smith.
Hitting the poorest harder than the rich.
Women harder than men.
Hitting the sick and disabled.
Pensioners and children are being hit hardest of all.
The nasty party is back, and this time they’ve brought along their mates.
From this April, over 50,000 of our poorest pensioners will lose an average £11 a wee k from their housing benefit.
Thousands of pensioners who will struggle to pay the rent.
Conference this party believes people who worked all their lives have a right to a secure home in their retirement.
And we should be proud of action we took to lift 600,000 children out of poverty. But the government is trying to turn back the clock.
Cutting maternity allowance, ending the child trust fund, the baby tax credit.
Taking £1200 from working families with new born babies in that important first year of life.
At least Margaret Thatcher had the grace to wait til the babes were weaned before she snatched their milk.
That money is what lets a new mum stay home with her little one a bit longer before she goes back to work to pay the bills.
It lets new dads cut back on the overtime so they can spend more time at home.
For thousands of new parents across the country, that money means precious, precious time at the start of a family’s life.
David Cameron said this would be the most family friendly Government ever.
In fact they have launched the biggest assault on the family in the entire history of the welfare state. And this party must fight it all the way.
This is a Government which just doesn’t understand women’s lives.
They’ve halved the number of women in the government – and let’s be honest we needed more women before.
George Osborne’s Budget hit women three times as hard as men.
£8 billion raised, £6 billion of it from women.
Even though women earn less and own less than men.
Nick Clegg says things like working tax credits, child benefit, carers allowance make people dependent and should be cut back.
For millions of women across Britain the opposite is true.
The tax credits help mums pay for child care so they can go out to work.
The carers allowance helps daughters look after their elderly parents.
That support doesn’t make them dependent. It gives them greater independence, greater choice about how to cope with the different pressures of work and family life.
Conference, all my life I have assumed that each generation of women would do better than the last.
I know I’ve had more choices, more opportunities than my mum and my grandma, not least because of the battles they won.
With each generation, I assumed, we would break more glass ceilings, change more of the world.
But now for the first time I worry about my daughters, about all our daughters. For the first time I worry that our daughters will have fewer chances in life than we did.
Conference, for women across Britain, backed by the Labour Party, the fight back starts here.
Throughout our history the Labour Party has fought for equality.
Fought for working families.
Fought for dignity in old age.
And throughout our history – from the Jarrow marches to the New Deal – we have fought for jobs.
Fighting for jobs, backing our economy, standing up for fairness, united behind our new leader; this must again be Labour’s crusade.
"
Donald Trump,"So I was asked to go by the President, who I get along with very well, despite a lot of fake news. You know, I actually have a very good relationship with all of the people at the G20. And he called me, he said, would you come, it's Bastille Day -- 100 years since World War I. And I said, that's big deal, 100 years since World War I. So we're going to go, I think we're going to have a great time, and we're going to do something good. And he's doing a good job. He's doing a good job as President.
A big thing we have with China was, if they could help us with North Korea, that would be great. They have pressures that are tough pressures, and I understand. And you know, don't forget, China, over the many years, has been at war with Korea -- you know, wars with Korea. It's not like, oh, gee, you just do whatever we say. They've had numerous wars with Korea.
They have an 8,000 year culture. So when they see 1776 -- to them, that's like a modern building. The White House was started -- was essentially built in 1799. To us, that's really old. To them, that's like a super modern building, right? So, you know, they've had tremendous conflict over many, many centuries with Korea. So it's not just like, you do this. But we're going to find out what happens.
Very important to me with China, we have to fix the trade. We have to fix the trade. And I've been going a little bit easier because I'd like to have their help. But we have to fix the trade with China because it's very, very none-reciprocal.
Nobody has ever said it before. I say it all the time. Somebody said, what cards do you have? I said, very simple -- trade. We are being absolutely devastated by bad trade deals. We have the worst of all trade deals is with China.
We have a bad deal with South Korea. We're just starting negotiations with South Korea. South Korea, we protect, but we're losing $40 billion a year with South Korea on trade. We have a trade deficit of $40 billion. The deal just came up.
That was another Hillary Clinton beauty. Remember she said it was five-year deal, and now it's an extension period. She said this will put jobs in our country. She said we'll make money with it. Great. We're losing $40 billion a year. It's a horrible deal. So we're starting -- we started, as of yesterday, renegotiating the deal with South Korea. We have to.
But the biggest strength we have are these horrendous trade deals, like with China. That's our strength. But we're going to fix them. But in terms of North Korea, our strength is trade.
Well, yeah, when I say reciprocal -- you make reciprocal deals, you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. But before I did that, I wanted to give it a good shot. Let's see. And they helped us. I have a very good relationship with him. I think he's a tremendous guy. But don't forget. He's for China. I'm for the U.S. So that's always going to be.
So he could be a tremendous guy, but he's going to do what's good for China. And he doesn't want 50 million people pouring across his border. You know, there are a lot of things. I understand the other side. You always have to understand the other side.
Steel is a big problem. Steel is -- I mean, they're dumping steel. Not only China, but others. We're like a dumping ground, okay? They're dumping steel and destroying our steel industry, they've been doing it for decades, and I'm stopping it. It'll stop.
There are two ways -- quotas and tariffs. Maybe I'll do both.
No, I think, first, I want to do -- well, we have a few things. We have a thing called healthcare. I'm sure you haven't been reading about it too much. It is one of the -- I'd say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare. It's like this narrow road that about a quarter of an inch wide. You get a couple here and you say, great, and then you find out you just lost four over here. Healthcare is tough.
But I think we're going to have something that's really good and that people are going to like. We're going to find out over the next -- you know, we just extended for two weeks. Which, that's a big --
No, not joking, no. There is a chance that we can do a solar wall. We have major companies looking at that. Look, there's no better place for solar than the Mexico border -- the southern border. And there is a very good chance we can do a solar wall, which would actually look good. But there is a very good chance we could do a solar wall.
One of the things with the wall is you need transparency. You have to be able to see through it. In other words, if you can't see through that wall -- so it could be a steel wall with openings, but you have to have openings because you have to see what's on the other side of the wall.
And I'll give you an example. As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don't see them -- they hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It's over. As crazy as that sounds, you need transparency through that wall. But we have some incredible designs.
But we are seriously looking at a solar wall. And remember this, it's a 2,000 mile border, but you don't need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don't really have people crossing. So you don't need that. But you'll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles.
Plus we have some wall that's already up that we're already fixing. You know, we've already started the wall because we're fixing large portions of wall right now. We're taking wall that was good but it's in very bad shape, and we're making it new. We're fixing it. It's already started. So in a true sense, we've already started the wall.
Don is -- as many of you know Don -- he's a good boy. He's a good kid. And he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting. It was a short meeting as he told me -- because I only heard about it two or three days ago.
As he told me, the meeting went -- and it was attended by a couple of other people who -- one of them left after a few minutes -- which is Jared. The other one was playing with his iPhone. Don listened, out of politeness, and realized it wasn't...
Honestly, in a world of politics, most people are going to take that meeting. If somebody called and said, hey -- and you're a Democrat -- and by the way, they have taken them -- hey, I have really some information on Donald Trump. You're running against Donald Trump. Can I see you? I mean, how many people are not going to take the meeting?
What meeting?
He didn't say that. No. He said, I think he accepted it, but you'd have to ask him. That's a big difference. So I said, very simply -- and the first 45 minutes, don't forget, most of the papers said I'd never bring it up. Had to be the first 20 to 25 minutes.
And I said to him, were you involved with the meddling in the election? He said, absolutely not. I was not involved. He was very strong on it. I then said to him again, in a totally different way, were you involved with the meddling. He said, I was not -- absolutely not.
Somebody said later to me, which was interesting. Said, let me tell you, if they were involved, you wouldn't have found out about it. Okay, which is a very interesting point.
What I said, I asked him, were you involved? He said, very strongly -- said to him a second time -- totally different -- were you involved? Because we can't let that happen. And I mean whether it's Russia or anybody else, we can't let there be even a scintilla of doubt when it comes to an election. I mean, I'm very strong on that.
And I'm not saying it wasn't Russia. What I'm saying is that we have to protect ourselves no matter who it is. You know, China is very good at this. I hate to say it, North Korea is very good at this. Look what they did to Sony Studios. They were the ones that did the whole deal to Sony. You know, we're dealing with highly sophisticated people.
So, China is very good. You have many countries. And you have many individuals that are very good at this. But we can't have -- and I did say, we can't have a scintilla of doubt as our elections and going forward.
I told him. I said, look, we can't -- we can't have -- now, he said absolutely not twice. What do you do? End up in a fistfight with somebody, okay? Because then I brought up Syria, and I said --
Very shortly there afterward. And I said, there's so much killing in Syria. We got to solve Syria. We've got to solve Ukraine. And you know, I've always said -- and I'm not just talking about Russia -- we're a lot better off -- like it's a good thing that I have a good relationship with President Xi. It's a good thing I have a good relationship with every one of them -- Modi -- you saw that. Every single one of them of all 19 -- there's 20 with us. All 19, I have a great relationship with.
So we're doing well. I mean, we're doing well and we're having a good time. Now what we'll do is we'll go celebrate with the President of France -- we have a good relationship -- open up a little trade with them. But it's got to be fair trade. I mean, every deal we have is bad. It's got to be fair trade.
I mean, the European Union, as an example -- I'm all for the European Union, but we have things that we can barely sell into the European Union. They're very protectionist. And we're not. And you have to be reciprocal.
To me, the word reciprocal is a beautiful word. Because people can say, we don't like a border tax or we don't like this or we don't like that. But what they can't say is that, if you're selling a motorcycle and they're coming into your country and not paying tax, and they're going into another country and paying 100 percent tax, people understand that's not fair. So we say we make it reciprocal.
I would say yes, yeah. At the right time. I don't think this is the right time, but the answer is yes I would. Look, it's very easy for me to say absolutely, I won't. That's the easy thing for me to do, but that's the stupid thing to do. Let's be the smart people not the stupid people. The easiest thing for me to tell you is that I would never invite him. We will never ever talk to Russia.
That all of my friends in Congress will say, oh he's so wonderful, he's so wonderful. Folks, we have perhaps the second most powerful nuclear country in the world. If you don't have dialogue, you have to be fools. Fools. It would be the easiest thing for me to say to Maggie and all of you, I will never speak to him, and everybody would love me. But I have to do what's right.
And, by the way, I only want to make great deals with Russia. Remember this, I have built up -- we're getting $57 billion more for the military. Hillary was going to cut the military. I'm a tremendous fracker, coal, natural gas, alternate energy, wind Ð everything, right? But I'm going to produce much much more energy than anyone else who was ever running for office. Ever. We're going to have clean coal, and Hillary wasn't.
Hillary was going to stop fracking. She was going to stop coal totally. Hey, in West Virginia I beat her by 42 points. Remember, she went and sat with the miners and they said get the hell out of here. So, I was going to -- if Hillary got in, your energy prices right now would be double. You'd be doing no fracking. You'd be doing practically no fossil fuels.
So Putin, everything I do is the exact opposite. I don't believe -- in fact, the one question that I didn't ask him that I wish I did -- but we had so many other things going, and really the ceasefire was a very complicated talk, it was a very important talk to me because I wanted to see if we could start a ceasefire.
Now, why does that affect Russia? Because Russia makes its money through selling of oil, and we've got underneath us more oil than anybody, and nobody knew it until five years ago. And I want to use it. And I don't want that taken away by the Paris Accord. I don't want them to say all of that wealth that the United States has under its feet, but that China doesn't have and that other countries don't have, we can't use.
So now we no longer have the advantage. We have a tremendous advantage. We have more natural resources under our feet than any other country. That's a pretty big statement. Ten years ago, five years ago even, you couldn't make that statement. We're blessed. I don't want to give it up. I don't want to say oh, okay, we won't use it. But think of it. So, if Hillary is there, you're going to have a far less amount of fuel. Therefore, energy prices will be much, much higher. That's great for Russia.
So, the next time I'm with Putin, I'm going to ask him: who were you really for? Because I can't believe that he would have been for me. Me. Strong military, strong borders -- but he cares less about the borders -- but strong military, tremendous.
We're going to be an exporter of fuel this year. We're going to be exporting. What was the first thing I signed when I got in? The Keystone Pipeline, and the Keystone Pipeline goes from Canada all the way through our country right into the Gulf, and the ships are there to take it all over and compete with Russia.
The first thing I signed, the first day, was the Keystone Pipeline. That first * was the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipeline -- also Dakota Access. Now, what does that mean? Dakota Access takes it to the Pacific. Who do they compete with? Russia. Hillary would have never signed -- that was with the reservation -- she would have never signed it. I was given great credit for that one. That was a tough one. First day.
It's also 48,000 jobs between both of them. The other one I signed, that was the Keystone. That was dead. That was dead for two years. It was never going to happen. I revived it on day one. You know, you'll check, please check it. I have to be exactly accurate. They'll say, oh I wasn't totally accurate. But that goes to the Gulf, right? Competes with Russia.
So now oil is getting to be record low -- and gas -- because we're producing so much.
Well, I'm not talking about new, I'm talking about the old sanctions. Wait, we got to get this right. Ready? I think I said it right but just in case. We have very heavy sanctions on Russia right now. I would not and have never even thought about taking them off. Somebody said, Donald Trump wants to -- I don't want to take them off.
He never raised it. We did, I think, talk about the sanctions that Congress wants to pass, but it was very brief. Much of it was talked about Ukraine. Look, we talked about the elections. We talked about Ukraine and Syria. Not in that order. We talked about Syria and Ukraine. But I will just tell you, I didn't say this to him. We didn't talk about this aspect of it. I would never take the sanctions off until something is worked out to our satisfaction and everybody's satisfaction in Syria and in Ukraine.
I saw a report and I read a report that Trump wants to take off the sanctions. I've made a lot of money. I've made great deals. That's what I do. Why would I take sanctions off without getting anything?
What pressure? I didn't -- I did nothing. Hey, now it's shown there's no collusion, there's no obstruction, there's no nothing. Honestly, the whole thing, it is really a media witch hunt. It's been a media witch hunt. And it's bad for the country. You know, when you talk about Russia, if Russia actually did whatever they want to do, they got to be laughing, because look at what happens -- how much time...
They feel it's a witch hunt, the people. There are a lot of people. And those people vote. They don't stay home because it's drizzling. We proved that. But every single party chairman said that my base is substantially stronger than it was in November. That's a big compliment. That's a big compliment. And I feel it.
And I think what's happening is, as usual, the Democrats have played their card too hard on the Russia thing, because people aren't believing it. It's a witch hunt and they understand that. When they say ""treason"" -- you know what treason is? That's Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving the atomic bomb, okay? But what about all the congressmen, where I see the woman sitting there surrounded by -- in Congress.
So I think it's a good thing. When Hillary Clinton spent her ads -- you know, she spent almost 100 percent of her ads on anti-Donald Trump ads. You know that. Every ad was an anti ad. When the election came, nobody knew what she stood for.
I heard tonight, and I saw tonight, and I read tonight that they're making a big mistake. And I a lot of the Democrats feel -- they say, we're putting all our money into this Russia stuff and it's making Trump stronger. Because my people and the people that support me, who are incredible people, those people are angry because they feel it's being unfair and a witch hunt.
"
Donald Trump,"I’m sorry. Well thank you very much. It’s great to be with President Macron of France, and we’ve had a very long relationship and a very good one. And we were just discussing certain things, and then we’d have a long conversation afterwards. First of all, before we begin, I want to pay my respects to the great warriors that you lost in Mali, 13 helicopters. It was sad. I’ve gotten a report on it. We talked about it, and please give my condolences to the families and to France, great fighters. You’ve done a fantastic job in that whole area. It’s a tough area, so we appreciate it very much.
We’ll be talking about a lot of things including NATO and including trade. We do a lot of trade with France, and we have a minor dispute. I think we’ll probably be able to work it out. But, we have a big trade relationship, and I’m sure that within a short period of time, things will be looking very rosy, we hope. That’s usually the case with the two of us. We get our work done. We’ve had a lot of cool things. We’ve done a lot of good things together as partners. Our countries have been partners in many good ventures including some having to do with radical Islam and others. It’s always worked out, so I look forward to our discussion.
We made a lot of progress in our first 25 minutes, and we intend to make a lot of progress in our next hour, maybe hour and a half. So, thank you very much.
Well, we just began discussing NATO. And what I’m liking about NATO is that a lot of countries have stepped up, I think really at my behest and also yourself. You’re close to that level.
They’ve stepped up, and they’ve put up a lot of money. I think it was 130 billion dollars, and that’s a lot. They’re not stepping up again. It’s going to be 400 billion dollars. But we are very sure we have commitments to 400 billion dollars. We just left the Secretary General, and he’s got some things that are very important, and discussed with him the flexibility so that we have it’s not just with one area of the world. You and I discuss this all the time. We have all areas of the world because NATO’s a lot different than it was, and now it’s certainly a lot different over the last three years. So, we have a lot of countries stepping up and putting up a lot of money. The number, as of this moment, is exactly 131 billion dollars. That’s a year, and that’s a tremendous amount of money, but it’s not enough. They also raised and have commitments for 400 billion dollars.
So, NATO, which was really heading in the wrong direction three years ago is heading down. If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don’t think they could’ve gone on much longer. Now, it’s actually very strong and getting stronger. Many people are committed to that 2%, and ultimately, I think the 2% will be raised. The President and I, I think, feel that we need more flexibility. And I think we both agree on that so that we can use it for other things, not just looking at one specific country. A lot of people say it was meant to look at originally the Soviet Union, now Russia. But, we also have other things to look at, whether it’s radical Islamic terrorism, whether it’s the tremendous growth of China. There are a lot of other things.
NATO is becoming different than it was, much bigger than it was, and much stronger than it was because people are now fulfilling their commitments. There are some countries that aren’t fulfilling their commitment, and those countries are going to be dealt with. Maybe I’ll deal with them from a trade standpoint. Maybe I’ll deal with them in a different way. I’ll work something out where they have to pay, but we don’t wan to have people delinquent. I really don’t think it’s fair for us to be involved, including France, by the way, to be involved if you have countries that aren’t paying their way. They’re less than 1%. You have a couple that are less than 1%. Not fair.
NATO has made a lot of progress over the last three years, and the word flexibility is very important. They’re not just looking at one area now. They’re looking at the world, and it’s very important. To me, it’s very important.
Yes?
Well, one thing I would also like to say that you’ve been really doing a great job in Africa, and you’ve been very much involved there, more than most. And that’s been fantastic. I appreciate you saying the United States for decades have been paying really way, way disproportionately too much, and you have other countries paying far too little that are very directly benefited by it and by the United States’ involvement. We’re changing that around somewhat, it’s important. But, we’re a very important player. I think without us, NATO certainly is not the same thing as we discussed, and discuss it at length. This morning, we discussed it with Secretary General Stoltenberg. But, we’re behind you 100%, and all of the money that’s been raised, and all of these countries that are all of a sudden putting up money, it’s a great thing to see.
But, we do have a great… We really have a different objective, I think, right now. We’re looking at a much bigger picture, and that includes… You mentioned Iraq, but it really includes Iran, too, I think. If you look at what’s going on in Iran, they have massive riots. They’re having protests all over the country, and they’re killing a lot of people. Everybody knows that. That’s why they turned off their internet system, so nobody can find out. But, if the media would go there, and I think it’s very hard for the media to go there, frankly, right now. But, they’re killing a lot of people.
But, NATO has come a long way in three years, and it’s something that we’re very proud of because we’re with them. NATO serves a fantastic function if everybody’s involved. If they’re not involved… And I really believe that the President is very much involved and likes the idea of NATO, but he wants it also to be utilized properly. If it’s not utilized properly, we all agree, right? That’s no good.
We’ve had a very good discussion. A lot of people, and we’re meeting with a lot of countries later, as you know. They’re really stepping up. For the most part, they’re all stepping up. We have one or two that aren’t, and we’ll have to deal with them in a different way. Maybe, as I said, we’ll deal with them on trade. We have a lot of power with respect to trade. They make a fortune with the United States, and then they don’t pay their bills. That’s no good. But NATO’s come a long way in three years, and it’s become very powerful, I think, very very powerful. It’s become, I think, a much fairer statement in terms of the United States because we’re able to go down a little bit.
We were paying four or 4.3% of the largest GDP ever. Nobody’s ever had a GDP like we have right now, and nobody’s come close. Other people were paying 1%. Some people were paying less than 1% of a very small GDP. It’s not fair. And they get it back. We protect them, but it’s not fair. So, a lot of changes have been made.
Right. Well, we’re working on that right now. We have discussed it. I think we’ll be able to work something out, I hope, and maybe not. Maybe we’ll do it through taxing. We could work it out easily through taxing. But, the American companies, the tech companies that you’re talking about, they aren’t my favorite people because they’re not exactly for me. But, that’s okay. I don’t care. They’re American companies, and we want to tax American companies. It’s important. We want to tax them. That’s not for somebody else to tax.
As the President knows, we tax wine, and we have other taxes scheduled. But, we’d rather not do that. But, that’s the way it would work. So, it’s either going to work out, or we’ll work out some mutually beneficial tax. And the tax will be substantial, and I’m not sure it’s going to come to that, but it might.
Well, I haven’t asked that to the President today. I have over the period of time. We have a tremendous amount of captured ISIS fighters over in Syria, and they’re all under lock and key. But, many are from France, many are from Germany, and many are from the UK. They’re mostly from Europe, and some of the countries are agreeing… I have not spoken to the President about that. Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?
I could give them to you. You can take every one you want.
This is why he’s a great politician because that was one of the greatest non-answers I’ve ever heard, and that’s okay.
France has actually taken back some fighters. But, we have a lot of fighters. We’ve captured a lot of people, and we have captured 100% of the caliphate. But, you know that that means they keep going and going. We sent a small contingent in, and we wiped out another portion of ISIS. We don’t want to happen to me what happened with President Obama, where it reformed, and then it became stronger than it was in the first place. So, we don’t want that to happen. As I said before, we’ve taken the oil. We have the oil, so we have total control of the oil so that they’re not going to be able to use it. They use that oil to really fuel up their wealth, to fuel up their money. That was a primary source of income.
And they get contributions, and we have now lists of where these contributions come from, which is very important. People contributed, if you can believe it. Some of these people are wealthy people that made contributions, and we have lists of… We learned a lot. When we got al-Baghdadi, that was a great get. And when we killed him, we have a lot of information that I’m revealing now for the first time. But, we also got a lot of good information. A lot of things are happening, and France has been very helpful. I have to say that they’ve been very very helpful. Okay.
Go ahead. Any other questions, please?
I largely agree with that answer. I just have to say that I came into a position, where the European Union was making anywhere from 100 to 150 billion dollars a year in deficits to the United States. They were making it. We were losing it, so we had to do something that is fair, not severe. I think fair. We’re losing tremendous amounts of money. As you know, the European Union is very strong on barriers. Barriers meaning certain of our products can’t come in, including agriculture product. It just can’t come in. We can’t sell it, and yet the European Union sells openly to the United States and generally untaxed or taxed at a low level. So, these are problems that we’re talking about. These are problems that we’re working out, and the digital tax is the least of it.
I inherited a situation where the European Union, which was formed partially for this reason. I guess for a lot of reasons, it was formed, but partially to make better or take advantage of the United States. They’ve done that very brilliantly, and frankly, it’s not right. So, I’ve exposed it. A lot of people didn’t know it, and we’re doing things about it. We have no choice because the United States can’t continue to lose the kind of money that they’ve lost literally since the formation of the European Union. And I think we’ll work something out. They want to talk, as you know. The new head wants to talk, who is supposed to be a very respected woman, very highly respected, and I look forward to meeting her. They want to meet.
But, we have a very unfair trade situation, where the US loses a lot of money for many, many years with the European Union, billions and billions of dollars. To be specific, over 150 billion dollars a year. So, we don’t want to be doing that, and we can make a deal, or we could take a harsh approach. We could solve that problem instantaneously, if we wanted to. But, I don’t want to do that. These are friends of ours. These are people that we’ve had very extraordinary relationships with, and I do personally. And I’m sure we can work something out.
I don’t want to comment on that, but the answer is no. But, I don’t want to comment on that.
Well, I can only say we have a very good relationship with Turkey, and with President Erdogan, I do. I can’t speak for the President of France. We have a very good relationship. We pulled our soldiers out and we said, “You can patrol your own border now. I don’t care who you do it with, but we’re not going to have soldiers patrolling the border that’s been fought over for 2,000 years.” But, we took our soldiers out. We put some of the soldiers around the area where we’ve captured the oil and taken the oil, and we have the oil. And we’ve brought some home, and we will be bringing some home, and we’ve sent some to other areas. But, we have a very good relationship with Turkey.
This is really why we’re having meetings. Those are our points, and we’ll be discussing that with the President today. Yes?
We’re looking at it now, and we’re talking about it now. As you know, Turkey wanted to buy our Patriot system, and the Obama administration wouldn’t let them. They only let them when they were ready to buy another system, which is not the same system. But, Turkey, for a long period of time, wanted very much to buy the Patriot system, which is our system, which is what NATO uses, which is a great system, which is the best system. They wouldn’t sell it to Turkey. So, there are two sides of the story. I have to say this. But, we will be discussing that with Turkey in a little while. We’ll be meeting with Turkey in a little while, and also tomorrow.
Are you talking about Ambassador….
Oh, I thought you meant Woody Johnson.
I said, “Boy, he’s really risen rapidly.” Woody. Where is Woody? Is he here? He’s not here. This is his house. I can’t believe he’s not here.
Yes, we’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Johnson in a little while. I’ll be seeing him later on. We’re going over to number 10, which is a very exciting place to be, as you know. And we’ll be discussing a lot of different things. Yes.
No. I don’t have a comment on the London Bridge attack, other than to say that I was very proud of those people that grabbed them and did such a good job between the fire extinguishers and whatever else. It was an amazing job they did, and he was very violent. You could see that. I mean this was captured very much on tape. I think they were British citizens. The way they stepped up was incredible. That was really great. So, a terrible thing, a terrible attack. A lot of people very badly hurt. I believe three or four killed. Is it four now today? So, it’s terrible. It’s a terrible thing, and I know it’s an act of terrorism. It’s been declared an act of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism, by the way. And it’s very bad, very bad. But, I think the way they stepped up, to me, that was something very special. Okay?
I don’t think he does feel that. I think we get along with Russia. I think we could get along with Russia. I think you feel we can get along with Russia. We’ve discussed that before. But, certainly we have to be prepared. Whether it’s Russia or somebody else, we have to be prepared. But, you and I have a pretty similar view on that. I think we feel that we can get along with Russia, and I think it’s a good thing to get along with Russia. I campaigned on it, when I go into big stadiums, people like it. And, I think the Russian people would like to see it, too. A lot of good can come out of it. But, the purpose of NATO is that, but the purpose of NATO can be much more. And that’s where we’ve shown the flexibility over the last period of two years.
And I think the situation in Ukraine is very important. I think that the meetings coming up with Russia and Ukraine are very important. There is a possibility that some very big progress can be made. It’s very important for Ukraine. I think it’s very important from the standpoint of Russia, also, that they work out a treaty, they work out peace because they’ve been fighting a long time, too long. I think there’s a really good chance that that will happen. Also, with respect to nuclear weapons, I’ve spoken to President Putin, and I’ve communicated with him, and he very much wants to and so do we, work out a treaty of some kind on nuclear weapons. That will probably then include China at some point, and yourselves, by the way. But, it will include China and some other countries. But, we intend to see if we can work something out to stop the proliferation, to stop what’s happening because we are making a lot, and we are renovating a lot.
And frankly, the whole situation with nuclear is not a good situation. We ended the treaty because it wasn’t being adhered to by the other side. But, they want to make a treaty, and so do we, and I think it would be a great thing. I think it’s one of the most important things we can do, frankly. So, we’re going to be dealing with Russia on a treaty where we really… And we’re focused on nuclear and nuclear weapons, missiles, and nuclear weapons. And we think something can be worked out. We think they want to do it. We know they want to do it, and we want to do it, also.
I’ve spoke to China about it. During one of our trade negotiations, they were extremely excited about getting involved in that. So, some very good things can happen with respect to that. I think it’s very important. The whole nuclear situation, very very important.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
"
Andrew Cuomo,"… Over to Governor Murphy first and then we’ll hear from the other governors. I think most states. Oh, operator? We’re ready. Started hearing music. Okay. Thank you, Governors. I just said, I thank you all very much for your professionalism and your cooperation and everything you’ve done that has benefited the alliance with the state of New York. And I also want to thank you and congratulate you on what you’ve done for your states. It’s truly been outstanding and it’s my honor to be a colleague to you.
We’ve been talking today about the fact that New York believes we have reached a plateau in the increase of number of cases. They’re not going down, but they’re not going up at the same rate. And we believe it’s a quote/unquote plateau. And that is relatively good news in a world of bad options. And we should start looking forward to reopening quote/unquote, but reopening with a plan and a smart plan. Because if you do it wrong, it can backfire. And we’ve seen that in other places on the globe.
So everyone is very anxious to get out of the house, get back to work, get the economy moving. Everyone agrees with that. What the art form is going to be here is doing that smartly and doing that productively and doing that in a coordinated way. Doing that in coordination with the other states that are in the area and doing it as a cooperative effort where we learn from each other and we share information and we share resources and we share intelligence. No one has done this before. No one on this telephone has done it before. No other state has done it before. So it’s one step forward after research and consultation with experts.
I’m not a public health expert but this has to be informed by experts and by data. You take one step forward, you see how it works, and then you measure the next step. And to the extent we can do that together, that is the best course, there is no doubt about that.
I don’t believe we wind up with a fully common strategy. You have different states in different positions. Within this state, you have different areas with different circumstances. And the plan has to fit the facts and the circumstances. It’s one situation in New York City, it’s a different situation in rural counties, different situation in suburban counties. So how do you address those different set of facts?
And I want to make sure all the people we represent, make sure that we are smart in the way we are doing this. Yes, we’ve never been here before, but that doesn’t mean you can’t ensure public confidence that you’re doing everything you can to do it in a smart way, an informed way, guided by experts and data and science and not in a political way. And I think working together, we can do that.
Each state is going to name a public health official for that state, an economic development official for that state. Those officials and the chief of staff of the governor of each state will then form a working group that will start work immediately on designing a reopening plan, taking into consideration the public health concerns and issues and the economic reactivation issues and concerns. Study the data, study the research, study the experience of other countries, and give us guidelines and parameters to go forward.
Again, we anticipate different facts, different circumstances for different states, different parts of states, but let’s be smart and let’s be cooperative and let’s learn from one another. And that is inarguable. With that, let me turn it over to Governor Phil Murphy. Governor Murphy, thank you so much for being with us.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Governor Murphy. And you’re right, we started this journey together, we’re going to end it together on a positive note. Same with Governor Ned Lamont from the state of Connecticut. Governor Lamont, thank you very much. Thank you for being with us.
Amen. Thank you very much, Governor Lamont. Thank you. Governor Tom Wolf from Pennsylvania. Tom, good to be with you again.
Thank you, Governor Wolf. Thank you very much. I couldn’t agree more with what my colleagues are saying and Governor Wolf’s point. We talk about the economic toll, which you can quantify. You can’t quantify the emotional toll this has taken on people. And I think Governor Wolf is exactly right. Knowing that there’s another day, a new day coming, it may be different than past days but it can be a bright day. And that is true and we have to focus on that. Governor Carney, very good to be with you, John. Thank you very much for taking the time and all the help and all the coordination. Governor Carney?
Yes, I can. Yes we can, John.
Yes we can.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Governor Carney. And you’re so right, we’re all learning. This is new for all of us and it throws out a lot of the old rules and the old ways of doing business. And the state boundaries mean very little to this virus. And somebody can get on Amtrak or somebody can get in a car and go up the I-95 corridor and it doesn’t matter if they’re from Delaware or New Jersey or Connecticut or New York or what state they’re from, it can have the same consequence. So we’re learning and we’re growing every day. Thank you, John. And Governor Gina Raimondo from the state of Rhode Island. Governor Raimondo, thank you very much for taking the time to be with us. Thank you for working through all these issues with us on behalf of New York. Gina Raimondo.
Yes, yes we can.
Thank you very much Gina. Thank you, Governor Raimondo. And I couldn’t agree more with all of my colleagues and Governor Raimondo’s point. None of us have done this before. Sharing information, learning from each other, pooling resources is only smart, and we have to be smart. You need the best public health plan and you need the best economic reactivation plan. It’s not either/or, it has to be both. No one is willing to sacrifice one at the expense of the other, and you can’t have one at the expense of the other. But how you do it, that’s the art form.
We’re going to take questions, one question each from each state and then I’ll take questions from New York afterwards. Governor of the state of New Jersey, Governor Murphy is ready for any question from any reporter in the state of New Jersey.
We will not allow the New York reporters to question any other governor. I would not subject my colleagues.
State cooperation only goes so far. There have to be some-
Operator, anything?
Well said, Governor. Thank you very much for being with us, Governor Murphy.
Thank you, my friend. Operator, state of Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont. Do you have any questions from any reporters from Connecticut, Operator?
Great.
Thank you. Thank you Governor.
Thank you Ned Lamont very much for being with us today. Operator, anything for the state of Pennsylvania? Thank you, Ned. Governor Wolf?
Exactly right. Thank you very much, Tom. Thank you, Governor Wolf. Operator, do you have any questions for the state of Delaware? Governor John Carney.
State of Delaware.
Thank you John. Thank you, my friend, very much. I wish my leadership in the state of New York was as good as yours, and I had no questions whatsoever about my decisions. Maybe you teach me a few lessons. Thanks for being with us, John. Governor Gina Raimondo. Operator, do you have any calls for the state of Rhode Island?
Yep. Another governor who shows me up. Good to be with you, Gina. Thank you very much for taking the time.
Great, thank you all very much, thank you. I think, first I thank the governors very much. We’ve been working together for a number of days. Obviously we’ve been working all through this with many of the states on a daily basis. Again, nobody’s been here before. Nobody has all the answers. If they say they do, they don’t know the question in my opinion.
Addressing public health and addressing the economy, which is first? They’re both first. You can’t do one without the other. It’s a false choice. To move the economy forward, you have to address public health. To address public health, you have to be addressing the economic reactivation. You have to do both at once. They’re parallel tracks. That’s why we have the head of economic development, the head of health, and then the governor’s chief of staff from each state. So we have a total counsel of 18.
We’re still talking to other states. Any states who want to join are welcome to join. And again, it’s a sharing of information. Compare notes, compare experiences, sharing of university resources, scientific resources. And coming up with a plan that is consistent, if not complimentary, one state to the other. And certainly not where one state does something that is counter to another state. Which could happen. And I’ve seen that in the past. Governor Murphy for example from New Jersey’s point that what you do in New York just pushes people across the bridge to another state if it’s not consistent. That is exactly right. His work force is my work force, my work force is his work force. All these decisions affect everyone in the entire region.
What this virus says is all of your lines and boundaries make no sense. I can get on the Amtrak train and get off anywhere along that line. And if the person is positive, can infect scores of people. So you’re all interconnected. We’ve talked about it for a long time, but this makes the point. Questions?
Excuse me one second. Jesse?
They’re going to start talking literally tomorrow and start to scope that out. We didn’t start with a timetable. We said and will say to the group, we want it ASAP, but we want it smart. This is about being smart first. Not political, smart. Follow the data, learn from the other countries. Other countries have done this. You’re seeing mixed information and mixed data. Learn from the other countries, coordinate set of guidelines ASAP, but smart.
Oh, it has to be within weeks. It has to be within weeks.
Well look, I would say let’s see what the federal government’s plan is. Governor Wolfe’s point was right. He left it to the states to close down. And that was a state by state decision. Without any guidance really, he took the position that it was a state’s decision. And then the states were responsible for purchasing supplies, et cetera. So that was the model of management for this disaster emergency that was promulgated thus far. If they want to change the model, they can change the model. He’s the President of the United States, he is the federal government. And it is still civics 101. It’s federal, state, local government. He wants to change a management model, we look at the laws, state governance, federal governance.
Let him change a model consistent with the constitution, consistent with the law. But then change the model and explain it. What does that mean the federal government is in charge of opening? Are you going to say when each state can open or should open? Are you going to set a formula and that says any jurisdiction of X population that has X infection rate should be open or closed? Any population of X infection rate, these are the activities. This is what can be on public transit, this is what can be on the roads. Any jurisdiction that opens must have the following precautions. You must have a mask, you must have gloves. You can do that, that could be a model, where they set a federal program that the states can follow and should follow. But then you have to be specific.
Testing, states don’t have the capacity to test. It’s not as simple as saying states should test. They can’t do it without the federal government. There are not enough tests now. And there’s not enough reagents, and there’s not enough medical equipment. Any one of these governors would tell you on the phone. They don’t have the testing capacity and they can’t gather it themselves. So you want to change the management model, you can do that as president. But what is the model? And let’s learn from the past, right? Because this was not smooth sailing up till date, let’s be honest.
No, I’ve not had this conversation.
Let’s learn from the past. What does the federal government do and what does the state do? Tell me what are the roles. What’s my responsibility, what’s the federal responsibility? You want to shift the responsibilities in the relationship, fine, I’m open to that. Explain to me what I do, what they do. Who does purchasing, who pays, who does testing? I can’t. Open what, open it when, open it how? How do you differentiate between New York city, Albany, Buffalo, Nassau, Suffolk? Do I do the schools at the same time that I do businesses? Do I do the transportation system at the same time that I do businesses? What happens if I don’t have enough transportation workers? Do I still open the economy even though I don’t have enough transportation workers to run the trains?
You want to make those decisions? Tell me you want to make those decisions and then make them in a way that states can follow. Or say option B, federal government does this, states, you do this. You decide what the percentage is, I don’t want to. You decide what the appropriate time is to open and what functions, I don’t want to. You can do it any number of ways. But, it has to be clearly defined. You’re talking about states, under the states I then have to tell the cities what to do, I have to tell the counties what to do. I have 500 mayors, I have 50 county executives. I have to say to them this is the plan. Because each one of them wants to come up with their own plan.
So I can’t have… You want to tell me what to do, fine. But then I have to be able to turn around and tell my local governments what to do. So the clarity here is important. There is no conceptual answer. This is a very specific answer. I have to operate everyday. My life is all about management and operations. That’s what I do right now. I communicate the truth to the people of the state everyday and I have to manage the operation. And that’s everyday. Everyday I have to tell my local governments what to do. Everyday I have to tell the schools what to do. Everyday I have to tell the hospitals this is what’s coming on PPE. Everyday I have to tell the hospitals this is how we’re going to balance the patient load. That’s what I have to do.
But yeah, you’re President of the United States. You want to put forth a management model, let’s hear the model.
Let Jimmy just follow up, I’m sorry.
I wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t tell you that. You’d have to… That’s part of this study. What business do you open, when, what is the best thing? They all have a conversation, but for example, if you don’t have the fundamental systems aligned, you have nothing. If you want to open business, schools have to be open to any large degree. You want to turn the valve a lot? The schools have to be open. Why? Because you can’t open businesses if people don’t have child care.
Well I’m saying, you have to align the systems. You want to open businesses, you have to have the transportation system open. That will be the starting point for the conversation. Or you could say I’m not turning the valve that far. We’re going to ease into it, we’re going to phase into it, and this is how we’re going to do that. That’s what this group has to discuss. And then New York will have a strategy, each state will have a strategy. Hopefully they’re not inconsistent. I would love to do everything in unison as the optimum. If unison isn’t possible because we’re different and we have different needs, fine. But let’s at least know what each other is doing so we’re not counter productive with each other.
Frustrating, nothing’s frustrating, everything’s frustrating. And it’s not about an emotion. I just want clarity. Governor Wolfe’s point is right. The states closed. It is an interesting construct that it wasn’t the federal responsibility to close the economy, but it is the federal government’s responsibility to open the economy. If it’s your authority to open, why wasn’t it your authority to close? That’s an obvious question. When you say open, what does that mean? Does that mean that you’re going to proclaim all businesses open? Isolation over. Come out of your homes, businesses are open. What does it mean?
Governors need clarity. That’s what they need. You’re the president, there’s a constitution, there may be legal questions. What’s a federal responsibility, what’s a state responsibility? But the president has a lot of lawyers. So if it is a legal construct, your president of the united states. You want to put forth a disaster emergency plan? As president, that’s your right. By the way, this is a federally declared disaster.
I was in the federal government. The rules of government matter. There is an operating manual. States can declare disasters, and then the state is in charge over the local governments. Federal government declares an emergency, the federal government is now in charge. And they have done a federal emergency declaration here. Then why didn’t the federal government make decisions on closing? I don’t know. Could they now say we’re going to make decisions on opening? Yes. I don’t believe they could have a policy that says everybody opens five days from now. How do you differentiate different parts of the country with different infection rates? Different places on the curve, some are apex, some are at the plateau, some are on their way up the mountain. How do you do that differentiation?
Are you going to do a formula that says any place with an infection rate less than 2% can open. How do you do it? I don’t know. But he could put forth a model to do that.
Nick, go ahead.
What was the first part of that question?
No. There are no actions to take. The law on the situation is clear. I understand we have about 700 school districts. I understand we have about 500 mayors. I understand we have about 50 county executives. I understand everyone has a voice and has a role. Here this is a state emergency. The state will follow a uniform plan or a statewide strategy. Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, New York City schools, I closed at the same time. Why? Because you have to close all the schools in the metropolitan region at the same time. There’s too much interconnectivity to do it. It also has to be coordinated with the business plan. That is the only way it can work.
We had a total hodge podge of decisions with different school districts opening and different school districts closing all across the state. I came in, set a statewide closing policy. That is the law, that is what gov-
– closing policy. That is the law. That is what governs. Local school districts say, “Well, I normally make the decisions to open or close.” Yes, you normally do. Not in this situation, because this is a state emergency. “Well, you’re disrespecting the state, the County of Suffolk.” I’m not, but we’re one state and we can’t have every local government making independent decisions from every other local government. That would be mayhem. Second, you just heard the basic point, which is the state then has to coordinate with other states. I have to be able to say to New Jersey and Connecticut and Delaware and Rhode Island, “Here’s what I’m doing as a state.” I can’t have seven different policies within my state. Here’s my state policy. How do we conform? Then there’s another question where the President’s going to say, or could say the query, “I don’t care what you say, Governor. I’m going to assert my jurisdiction over the state because this is a federal emergency.”
And the President could say, which is the query of the question, “The federal government will determine what the states do.” I understand. I have mayors calling me. I have County executives calling me. I have school district officials calling me. They all have an opinion. I value all of their opinion, but we have one state, and the state will operate as one. And their decisions must fit within that plan or they’re not valid. If the federal government comes and says they’re going to substitute a federal plan, well, that would then trump a state plan, pardon the pun, if it fit within the constitution and the law.
Go ahead, Nick.
I’m sorry. Nick had a question. Go ahead.
Yeah.
All right. Let Nick do a question and then we’ll come back.
If, big I, big F, if we are at a plateau, and on the numbers that we’ve all seen, it looks like we’re reaching a plateau. Slight uptick still, day to day, but a flattening. We’ve done so much work and acquired so many materials and equipment, et cetera, that we are fine, knock formica, if we don’t go up. That’s why we returned the 35 ventilators to the nursing home. Also because the nursing home was so… How beautiful, just how beautiful. They just gratuitously called up and volunteered 35 ventilators. Nobody even called them and asked. From a nursing home, which is the most vulnerable place and vulnerable population, so we returned the 35 ventilators. We are fine, so to speak, from an equipment point of view right now if the number doesn’t go up. And to the extent anyone we borrowed ventilators from upstate New York, we can return them whenever they need them or as soon as practicable. But if they need them today, I can get them tomorrow.
I’m sorry?
What happened to the ventilators?
We ordered 17,000. I think we wound up getting about 3000 that actually came in.
I think it would be waiting for a long, long time. I think what happened was there were so many places competing for the orders in China that they kept upping the price and they took a next order. We were bidding against every other state in the country, so they would say the ventilator is $25,000. I would order it at $ 25,000, and then another state would come in and say, “I’ll pay $30,” and our order just basically got bumped. Some of the orders, the factories are saying, “We can get it to you in six months.” I don’t need ventilators in six months. We need them now. We’ve gotten about 3000. I don’t think we have any serious ideas that we’re going to get more. Do you know, guys?
No. All different vendors?
These are all Chinese companies. I don’t know their names, but that’s what I said. Let’s learn from what happened. What sense did it make that the FEMA says we don’t do purchasing, which is, by the way, what they used to do, right? I was there. I worked with FEMA. I was the HUD secretary. They used to purchase. That’s what they did. It’s a federal disaster. FEMA came in and was the logistics coordinator. In this case, they said it’s not a federal responsibility. It’s up to the states. Every state had to go out and buy ventilators and PPE and masks.
Lo and behold, the main manufacturer becomes China. So you have every state calling these Chinese companies, literally through brokers, trying to buy ventilators. Price goes through the roof. Everybody’s competing with everyone. I mean, it was total madness. So it’s why I say, you want to change the rules, that’s your prerogative. But what are the rules and do they make sense? For example, testing. states cannot test. I’m telling you right now, I do not have the capacity to do these tests. I can’t purchase enough diagnostic tests or equipment. So an opening plan that says you must open, by the way, you must test, I can’t do the tests.
We are not talking to Canada, I don’t believe. We’re talking to a number of states about who we’re coordinating on certain elements, not other elements, but this is a relatively new situation, today’s coalition. We’ll continue talking. Anybody who wants to join in the Northeast is welcome. The more information you share, the smarter the plan, the better. Can’t be bad.
Head of economic development is on the council from each state, head health official from each state, and governor’s chief of staff from each state. Three people from each state, six states, 18 people, and it will be a public health strategy and an economic development strategy that fits like this. You can’t do one without the other. You have to do both, and you have to integrate them in one plan, and I have to represent that I have one statewide plan for my state. My whole state will function that way. You want to divide it into downstate, mid-Hudson, upstate, by number of cases. That could be theoretically a suggestion from the commission council, but yes, those would be the guidelines. And then it has to be smarter, because you’re just sharing talent, you’re sharing resources.
The best minds from six states are better than best minds from just any one state, by definition, so it’ll be smarter. It will also be cooperative and collaborative where if Jersey and Connecticut put forth a plan that is not coordinated with New York, it hurts our compliance. And remember, we’re asking people to do very tough things. If you say, “Well, you can just go across the river and you have a different set of rules”, then people will get in their car. They’ll go stay with their brother-in-law who lives in New Jersey or their brother-in-law who lives in Connecticut, and they have a different set of rules. His restaurants are open. Our restaurants are closed. You know what happens? Everybody drives to that state to go to dinner. That’s all that happens.
It was the same point when we were talking about marijuana and the rules on marijuana. If you don’t conform those rules, people will just shop jurisdictions.
"
John Tyler,"To the People of the United States
The usual opportunity which is afforded to a Chief Magistrate upon his induction to office of presenting to his countrymen an exposition of the policy which would guide his Administration, in the form of an inaugural address, not having, under the peculiar circumstances which have brought me to the discharge of the high duties of President of the United States, been afforded to me, a brief exposition of the principles which will govern me in the general course of my administration of public affairs would seem to be due as well to myself as to you.
In regard to foreign nations, the groundwork of my policy will be justice on our part to all, submitting to injustice from none. While I shall sedulously cultivate the relations of peace and amity with one and all, it will be my most imperative duty to see that the honor of the country shall sustain no blemish. With a view to this, the condition of our military defenses will become a matter of anxious solicitude. The Army, which has in other days covered itself with renown, and the Navy, not inappropriately termed the right arm of the public defense, which has spread a light of glory over the American standard in all the waters of the earth, should be rendered replete with efficiency.
In view of the fact, well avouched by history, that the tendency of all human institutions is to concentrate power in the hands of a single man, and that their ultimate downfall has proceeded from this cause, I deem it of the most essential importance that a complete separation should take place between the sword and the purse. No matter where or how the public moneys shall be deposited, so long as the President can exert the power of appointing and removing at his pleasure the agents selected for their custody the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy is in fact the treasurer. A permanent and radical change should therefore be decreed. The patronage incident to the Presidential office, already great, is constantly increasing. Such increase is destined to keep pace with the growth of our population, until, without a figure of speech, an army of officeholders may be spread over the land. The unrestrained power exerted by a selfishly ambitious man in order either to perpetuate his authority or to hand it over to some favorite as his successor may lead to the employment of all the means within his control to accomplish his object. The right to remove from office, while subjected to no just restraint, is inevitably destined to produce a spirit of crouching servility with the official corps, which, in order to uphold the hand which feeds them, would lead to direct and active interference in the elections, both State and Federal, thereby subjecting the course of State legislation to the dictation of the chief executive officer and making the will of that officer absolute and supreme. I will at a proper time invoke the action of Congress upon this subject, and shall readily acquiesce in the adoption of all proper measures which are calculated to arrest these evils, so full of danger in their tendency. I will remove no incumbent from office who has faithfully and honestly acquitted himself of the duties of his office, except in such cases where such officer has been guilty of an active partisanship or by secret means--the less manly, and therefore the more objectionable has given his official influence to the purposes of party, thereby bringing the patronage of the Government in conflict with the freedom of elections. Numerous removals may become necessary under this rule. These will be made by me through no acerbity of feeling--I have had no cause to cherish or indulge unkind feelings toward any--but my conduct will be regulated by a profound sense of what is due to the country and its institutions; nor shall I neglect to apply the same unbending rule to those of my own appointment. Freedom of opinion will be tolerated, the full enjoyment of the right of suffrage will be maintained as the birthright of every American citizen; but I say emphatically to the official corps, ""Thus far and no farther."" I have dwelt the longer upon this subject because removals from office are likely often to arise, and I would have my countrymen to understand the principle of the Executive action.
In all public expenditures the most rigid economy should be resorted to, and, as one of its results, a public debt in time of peace be sedulously avoided. A wise and patriotic constituency will never object to the imposition of necessary burdens for useful ends, and true wisdom dictates the resort to such means in order to supply deficiencies in the revenue, rather than to those doubtful expedients which, ultimating in a public debt, serve to embarrass the resources of the country and to lessen its ability to meet any great emergency which may arise. All sinecures should be abolished. The appropriations should be direct and explicit, so as to leave as limited a share of discretion to the disbursing agents as may be found compatible with the public service. A strict responsibility on the part of all the agents of the Government should be maintained and peculation or defalcation visited with immediate expulsion from office and the most condign punishment.
The public interest also demands that if any war has existed between the Government and the currency it shall cease. Measures of a financial character now having the sanction of legal enactment shall be faithfully enforced until repealed by the legislative authority. But I owe it to myself to declare that I regard existing enactments as unwise and impolitic and in a high degree oppressive. I shall promptly give my sanction to any constitutional measure which, originating in Congress, shall have for its object the restoration of a sound circulating medium, so essentially necessary to give confidence in all the transactions of life, to secure to industry its just and adequate rewards, and to reestablish the public prosperity. In deciding upon the adaptation of any such measure to the end proposed, as well as its conformity to the Constitution, I shall resort to the fathers of the great republican school for advice and instruction, to be drawn from their sage views of our system of government and the light of their ever-glorious example.
The institutions under which we live, my countrymen, secure each person in the perfect enjoyment of all his rights. The spectacle is exhibited to the world of a government deriving its powers from the consent of the governed and having imparted to it only so much power as is necessary for its successful operation. Those who are charged with its administration should carefully abstain from all attempts to enlarge the range of powers thus granted to the several departments of the Government other than by an appeal to the people for additional grants, lest by so doing they disturb that balance which the patriots and statesmen who framed the Constitution designed to establish between the Federal Government and the States composing the Union. The observance of these rules is enjoined upon us by that feeling of reverence and affection which finds a place in the heart of every patriot for the preservation of union and the blessings of union--for the good of our children and our children's children through countless generations. An opposite course could not fail to generate factions intent upon the gratification of their selfish ends, to give birth to local and sectional jealousies, and to ultimate either in breaking asunder the bonds of union or in building up a central system which would inevitably end in a bloody scepter and an iron crown.
In conclusion I beg you to be assured that I shall exert myself to carry the foregoing principles into practice during my administration of the Government, and, confiding in the protecting care of an everwatchful and overruling Providence, it shall be my first and highest duty to preserve unimpaired the free institutions under which we live and transmit them to those who shall succeed me in their full force and vigor.

Donald Trump,"In the thereafter. Not only his Operation Warp Speed, accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing’s happened like this since the end of World War II. Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously, so everything goes at one time. We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting. It’s all going at one time. We have a system that has, I think it’s unparalleled, has never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work and work very well. We’re mass-producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one, that it’s approved, it will be available to the American people immediately and we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.
The world is suffering from this China virus. Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed, is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over 100, including Remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact. You see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically. Dexamethazone, convalescent plasma and antibody treatments, we have numerous treatments right now that are under study. I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that. On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage clinical trials, late stage. Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April.
Think of that. 85%, and it’s 25% lower than Europe as a whole. In the middle of April, more than 22% of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down. As of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7%. To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing. Very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They are pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially, more than 50%. Last week, our centers for Medicare and Medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care, diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.
What we’ve already sent, includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point of care tests. It’s a tremendous amount. That’s, you’ll get your response and answer from five to 15 minutes. Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point of care tests. Think of that. The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That’s more than all of Europe put together times two. Nobody’s even close, and as countries go, it is as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people. Through our relentless efforts, ` we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill. The cupboards were bare. I say it often. In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100,000,095 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face yields, and much, much more.
In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month and we’ll distribute them. We have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need, other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus. Last week, FEMA sent additional personnel protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves and 6 million gowns. It’s a lot. Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas and Arizona held steady and are now heading down. In Arizona they’re heading very substantially down and rapidly. We’ve been constant and in constant communication with the states and are surging them resources, when requested. They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately. We are totally full. We have everything we need. We get it to the states immediately.
We deal with the governors. The relationship with the governors has been very good. These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly. We are working with every governor and health commissioner, across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendation. States are different. My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America however, the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or under-counted. I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world. We report our cases. Most of the world doesn’t. They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick or they just don’t report.
Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly-infected countries outside of our borders. I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott, terrific gentlemen, and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas. We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people. We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators and half a million KN90 masks. Beginning this week, Texas hospitals, will receive 500 cases of Remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients. In addition to the cross border spread, the stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease, but can spread the disease.
We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance. I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wear masks when appropriate. We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions, to shield those at highest risk, which are in most cases, in many cases, the elderly, especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes. But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus, especially, especially those that are really targeted, almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic pandemic. America will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time as our visit here demonstrates.
I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina. Is a great place. It’s a phenomenal place. We’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time. I want to drive into the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible. When they call, I’m there. When they call, most of them, many of them are sitting here right now. I will always answer their call. Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here with us and let’s get onto a few questions. Tremendous progress has been made and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before. Please, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Well, I think so. But there would be not that same kind of hope if we weren’t doing so well where, before, just before I left the White House in the Oval Office, we had a meeting with our doctors, scientists, some others, and they’re making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics. I can tell you therapeutically, I think over the next couple of weeks, we’ll have some really very good things to say. We’re just having great answers. It is about that. It’s also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length, is just coming along really well. It’s not just one company. It’s many companies have had tremendous progress. That’ll be announced over the next very short period.
Well, I heard very positive things, but by the end of the year, we think we’re in very good shape to be doing that. By the end of this year, we’re going to, in terms of the vaccine, I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning you go and you give somebody, whether it’s transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal and they heal quickly. We’ve had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at Remdesivir and you look at some of the other things, but we’ll have some announcements on that over the next two weeks. Yeah, it is hope, but it’s only hope because we’ve gotten such incredible results, scientifically.
Yeah.
We don’t talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion and I think it was very productive. Please.
I don’t think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We’ve set record job numbers. We’ve set record numbers, whether it’s a pure V or a little bit less than that, I think it’s going to be very good. If therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you’re going to have a tremendous recovery, likewise, with the vaccines. If you do that by the end of the year, that’s ahead of schedule, substantially ahead of schedule and it’s ahead of anything that’s ever taken place in terms of vaccines before. I think if those things happen, if just one of those events happen, you’ll go right back into that V and I think you’re probably in the V anyway,. I really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening. We’ll see what happens with them, but a lot will have to do with the fact that therapeutically, I think you’re going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise. Yeah. Please go ahead. In the back.
Well, we’re actually coming to North Carolina as you know. We’re having a very major, I guess that would be the nomination night. That’s a Monday. That’ll be Monday. They’re going to be here and the rest we’ll do in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing and I’m really happy that we’re going to be having a piece of it, at least in a very important piece in North Carolina. Yes, please go ahead.
I think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Arizona, our numbers. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We’re leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it’s a terrible thing when you look at it. But I had the same thing four years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn’t going to win any state. I ended up winning every one of them. The swing States, I wasn’t going to win any of them and I want all of them. I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer.
They have it closer, but it’s the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state and substantially in other states, by even more than I won in ’16. When you look at Florida as an example, you have thousands of boats out of the ocean, out on the Intercoastal. You look at other states, where likewise, you have thousands of boats and their all waving the Trump sign, Trump/Pence sign, and they’re so proud. Thousands and thousands. You have seen it where you have bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends. I think there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been for my campaign. That includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there’s more today because what we’ve done nobody’s ever done before.
Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes, the most in our history, created the greatest economy we’ve ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody’s ever done. All of these different things, the VA, we got VA choice. We got VA, everything for the VA right now. They had a 91% approval rating. In a recent poll, I was just speaking to the secretary. 91% in the VA, that’s never happened before. I think when people see all that we’ve done, even Space Force, we created a force that actual, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, right? It’s pretty amazing. Coast guard. Now, Space Force. That hasn’t happened in 75 years. What we’ve done, working with some of those warriors over there, by the way, but what we’ve done has never been done. If you look at Alaska with ANWR, perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton, everybody wanted to get it done.
I got it done. ANWR in Alaska, probably, or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. Now, what we’ve done has been incredible. Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. By the way, gasoline prices for everyone, a very, very low. In many cases, less than $2. That’s pretty incredible. I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone and they cut way back and we’re now at $40 and plus a barrel. We’re saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We’re the number one in energy in the world. With all that we’ve done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history.
We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again, and everyone knows I’m going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn’t close I,. You would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more than that, what you have. We closed this greatest economy ever, far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs, they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they’ve had. Think of it. In 67 years. We were having the best year we’ve ever had. I had to close it and now we’re reopening it. Next year we’ll be stronger. It’ll be the strongest year so far. It’ll be better even than last year.
Okay. Thank you very much. I’ll be heading back. I’ll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much. We’re going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders. Thank you very much to the people of North Carolina. We love being here. Thank you.

Luke Hall,"We are laying this report today and will place a copy in the House of Commons Library. There has been a slight delay to the publication of the report, due on 31 March, as my Department focused on the emergency response to the covid-19 pandemic.
The Troubled Families Programme has been at the heart of our ambition to strengthen families and improve their futures since 2015. This year’s annual report details the programme’s performance for the period up to the end of March 2020, outlines the changes introduced for the 20-21 financial year to allow more families to be eligible for support, and clarifies how their progress towards outcomes will be measured. The report was drafted before the covid-19 pandemic so does not reflect the ongoing response from local government to support families during this unprecedented time.​
Improving families’ lives: fourth annual report of the Troubled Families Programme 2019-20 details how the programme is driving a profound shift in the way that local services respond to entrenched problems and support our most disadvantaged families. Assigning a single key worker to each family, backed by multi-agency partners and co-ordinated data, this joined up “wrap-around” support works with whole families to tackle the range of issues they face.
Over the lifetime of the programme, local authorities have supported 350,105 families to achieve successful outcomes, including 30,000 adults who were helped into sustained employment, although the programme has worked with many more families. These families faced multiple and complex problems including a combination of crime, truancy, neglect, antisocial behaviour, domestic abuse, poor mental health, worklessness and financial exclusion. Every successful family outcome represents a family’s life changed for the better—a considerable achievement for the families and the local authorities supporting them.
Analysis to track family outcomes over time, and case study research, indicates that the programme delivered successful outcomes by intervening early to prevent escalation to children’s social care. Analysis found that for every £1 spent on the programme it delivers £2.51 of fiscal benefits (only budgetary impacts on services).
Analysis also suggests that the programme is reducing the probability of future interaction with the criminal justice system, and the severity of offending, for adults and juveniles who had been convicted or given a custodial sentence before they joined the programme.
The Troubled Families Programme has received new investment to extend the programme for an additional year. The additional Government funding of £165 million will enable the current programme to continue until the end of 2020-21.
The refreshed financial framework for 2020-21 was published on 14 May 2020 and sets out the expanded eligibility criteria and an explanation of the way in which local authorities should identify and support families using a range of indicators.
“Improving families’ lives: fourth annual report of the Troubled Families Programme 2019-2020” is accompanied by a range of publications that evaluate the programme’s progress which can be accessed at: www.gov.uk.
These are:
Analysis of national and local data sets: part five.
Staff Surveys—Troubled Families Co-ordinators: part four.
Staff Surveys—Troubled Families Keyworkers: part four.
Staff Surveys—Troubled Families Employment Advisors: part four.

Donald Trump,"Even though gasoline and oil prices are going right through the roof, I have no doubt in my mind that President Obama made a deal with the Saudis to flood the markets with oil before the election. So he can at least keep it down a little bit after the election. It's going to be a mess.
You're gonna see numbers like you've never seen if he wins, let's hope he doesn't win. So remember, I said it if he wins oil and gasoline through the roof like never before, I believe a deal was made. It's a sinister deal.
But let's see whether or not I was right. It's not going to be a pretty picture the story about the contestant who wanted to become Miss Universe by going through Canada. Very interesting.
It's become a big, big story. We let her in. Let's see what happens.
Maybe she'll do well. Maybe she won't. You have 58 different girls trying to be Miss Canada.
It'll be very interesting to see what happens if for some reason she should win well, then she has to win the Miss Universe contest. Everybody wants to be Miss Universe. I don't think it's going to be easy.
We've had a great season on The Apprentice Sunday night. It was a three-hour episode. I've never even heard of a three-hour episode for anything, but that's what it was.
It was exciting. We had a double boardroom, but now it really gets nasty starting this week. I've never seen anything like it on television.
"
Donald Trump,"John Miller.
Yes, that's correct.
Yeah, I saw that.
Well, it just that he really decided that he wasn't, you know, he didn't want to make any commitment.  He didn't want to make a commitment.  He really thought it was too soon.  He's coming out of a marriage, and he's starting to do tremendously well financially.  As you saw, he got his licenses five to nothing the other day and totally unanimous.  And he's really been working hard and doing well.  And probably, as you know, there's a real estate depression in the United States and he's probably doing as well as anybody there is.  And frankly, he wants to keep it that way.  And he just thought it was too soon to make any commitment to anybody.
Well, he treats everybody well.  You know, you don't know him, but he's a --
Have you met him?  He's a good guy and he's not going to hurt anybody.  The one article said he was going to throw her out of the apartment is total nonsense.  He is going to always treat her well as he treated his wife well.  I mean, he paid his wife a great deal of money.  He did it in a very bad period of time and, ultimately, that was settled.  There were those that say that that was even put that way.  I don't know if you heard that but that Trump became poor until he got his divorce.  And then all of a sudden, he's been doing very well and I guess you probably heard that, too.
But he treated his wife well and he treated -- and he will treat Marla well.  He's somebody that has a lot of options, and, frankly, he gets called by everybody. He gets called by everybody in the book, in terms of women.
Well, he gets called by a lot of people.
I think it's somebody that -- you know, she's beautiful.  I saw her once quickly and she's beautiful and all, but I think that he's got a whole open field really.  A lot of the people that you write about, and you people do a great job, by the way, but a lot of the people that you write about really are -- I mean, they call.  They just call.  Actresses, people that you write about just call to see if they can go out with him and things.
He was so set up with that.  You know, Madonna called and what happened -- I mean, I don't know if you want to listen to this.
Do you?  Do you have a second?
What happened is it was a benefit at the Plaza Hotel which he owned for Vreeland, Diana Vrelland, or no, for Martha Graham.  It was a ball benefit for Martha actually just before she passed away.  And Madonna was there and she came in a beautiful evening gown and combat boots.  She was wearing combat boots, and Trump was asked to go over to meet her.  And he was there just for a little while to say hello and to make a speech and make like an introductory speech.
Madonna was in the room, and so somebody from Madonna's entourage, because she comes in with an entourage of dancers and everything else, and somebody from Madonna's entourage came over and said, ""Would you go over and say hello to Madonna?"" And so he went over and said hello to Madonna and he gave his autograph to the dancers.  She said, ""These are fans"" and all this.  ""Will you give them the autograph?""  So he said, ""Best wishes"" or something.  And then all of a sudden -- and that was the end.  And then he said goodbye to her and that was literally the end.  He's got zero interest in Madonna.  It was literally the end.
And the next day in the newspapers, they had a story that he wanted to go out with her and everything else.  Besides that, that she was sitting there with her boyfriend.  I think his name was Ward or something --
-- and she was sitting there right with her boyfriend.  So, I mean, it wouldn't be appropriate.
.  So, somehow, there was a thing.  And then she called recently about this fight and wanted to go out.  You know, she's got this PR machine that I guess you people play to very well but it really was nonsense.  So, anyway.
Well, she called and wanted to go out with him, that I can tell you.  And one of the other people that you're writing about -- by the way, I'm sort of new here.
Well, I'm sort of handling PR because he gets so much of it.  And frankly, I mean, I could tell you off the record.  Until I get to know you, off the record, I can tell you that he didn't care if he got bad PR until he got his divorce finished.
So when he got a lot of bad financial stuff, he liked it because, you know, it was good because he could get a divorce finished.  And once his divorce is finished, if you noticed since then he's doing well financially and he's doing well in every other way.  The licensing was five to nothing.  And people are saying how come all of a sudden he's doing so well?  And then I guess Newsday about two weeks ago did a story on that.  So I've sort of been put in here to handle because I've never seen anybody get so many calls from the press.
I basically worked for different firms.  I worked for a couple of different firms, and I'm somebody that he knows and I think somebody that he trusts and likes.  So I'm going to do this a little part time, and then, yeah, go on with my life, too.
Marla wants to be back with him and he wants to be with her, but he just, he just feels it's too soon.
Well, it was never an engagement ring, because that was my first question.  It was never an engagement ring.  It was a ring -- I mean, he wouldn't buy the engagement ring.  Actually, he bought the ring at the Taj Mahal at Tiffany's.  The only place that Tiffany's has that, you know, in a hotel is because of his relationship with Tiffany being the neighbor next door to Trump Tower and Tiffany decided to open up a store at the Taj Mahal.  And this was a way of giving Tiffany some business in addition to getting Ivan -- geting Marla something that would be nice.
So he did that, and as I told him and other people told him, when you want to buy a present, don't make it a ring the next time.  It was a little confusing.
Make it anything.  Anything but a ring, I guess.
It doesn't matter to him.  He truly doesn't care.  I've never seen somebody that's so immune, that he gets immune to, you know, some people would say you got bad press three or four months ago.  Now, he's starting to get good press where I don't know what you call this but this is a big press.
But I've never seen somebody so immune to -- he actually thrived on the bad press initially.  And once the divorce was over, he said, ""We have to change this"" and it's very interesting.  Frankly, if he got good press during the divorce, he'd be in court right now because she settled because she thought that she better believe the press and she settled.  And now, he's doing great and now she would like not to settle.
Ivana, when she didn't settle, she made a huge mistake and she's now had a huge fight with her lawyer, Michael Kennedy, over why they made the settlement. And it's over.  He sort of laughs at everything.
Well, it was a total violation of -- I mean, I could tell you --
Gangel-Jacob, yeah, but that's going to be -- the judge felt that when Donald got Ivana to sign that agreement, that Donald got Ivana to void her rights and that the judge was wrong because there's so much case law on that.  And what happened is the judge said -- by the way, she can take that clause out.  She just said she's not going to hold Ivana in contempt.  In other words, if somebody -- if she violates and she's not going to put Ivana in jail for violating.  Okay?  So she didn't void that clause.
Now, Donald's got a decision as to whether or not he wants to pay her any more money because by violating that clause, he in theory doesn't have to pay her any money.
I'm not sure what he's going to do.  Again, you could say that she shouldn't have done that either.  I mean, you sign an agreement, you go through months and months, and she can't say she didn't know this one.  And what he did was smart because he got not only Ivana to sign the agreement, but he got Ivana's lawyers to sign the agreement that she'd do it, that she speaks English perfectly, that everything in the agreement is known and studied and everything else.
So, in theory, I think he could probably -- you know, I think that could have cost her many millions of dollars.  I don't know that he's going to enforce it or not.
No, no.
Well, I can tell you this.  Just off the record, there's no way he gets married without a prenuptial agreement.  You understand that.  It was painful but worked in the Ivana case because, you know, while it was challenged, it still ended up being upheld and worked.  And frankly, she got not exactly one penny, she didn't get one penny more than what the agreement called for.  So that's that.  And she spent a lot of money on lawyers and a lot of money on everything and that was the year of the circus, but they do stand up.
I can tell you there was never any talk of marriage from Donald's point of view.  I can also say that Marla would've liked to get married, obviously, but it was just something he didn't want to do.  It's just too soon.  And, you know, hopefully, he'll maintain a good relationship with Marla.
Ivana wants to get back with Donald, but she --
What is she going to say?  What is she going to say?  She's going to say when he's with somebody else and had other people lined up, is she going to say, ""Yes, I want to get back.  I want to get back.""  You know, she's a pretty savvy woman and she's not going to say -- I mean, he's living with Marla and he's got three other girlfriends, and then, and she's not going to say, I really want to get back, you know?  She wants to get back, she's told it to a lot of her friends and she's told it to him, but it's so highly unlikely.  That's off the record.  He left.  I mean, it was his choice to leave and he left.
No, he didn't leave, no.  See, that's the biggest misconception of this whole thing.  The second question I asked about after the ring was the biggest misconception is he left.  He didn't leave for Marla.  He really left for himself.  He didn't leave for Marla.  He never left for Marla.  He was going to leave anyway.  Marla was there, but he was going to leave anyway.  Whether there was a Marla or not he was going to leave anyway.
So now he has somebody else named Carla who is beautiful and I guess you have something on her.  I don't know if you do or not.
Well, she's a very successful model, etc., etc.  But again, he didn't leave Marla for her. He leaves for himself, he does things for himself.  He, when he makes the decision, that will be a very lucky woman.  But he's not going to do that until he makes the decision.  You know, when he makes the decision, he's very capable of a total commitment when he makes the decision.  But he felt it's too soon.  Off the record, he probably felt Marla wasn't the right one, or whatever, but he just felt it was too soon.
At the Plaza Hotel, she was doing a Carolina Herrera fashion show.
Well she goes to them, but less so since, you know, since --
Probably a few months ago.
Well, not really.  And again, I heard with Carla -- I mean, I'll give you -- this is getting to be -- this is a little different from what I normally discuss.  This is I think an interesting point.  Carla is a very beautiful girl from Italy whose father is one of the wealthiest men in Europe.
Her father's name is -- her name is Carla Bruni Tedeschi.
I don't know.  But anyway, but her father is one of the wealthiest men in Europe., etc.  So she does all of the top shows and she's always very busy and very successful, etc., etc.  She was having a big thing with Mick Jagger.  Did you hear about this?
What happened is she was going with Eric Clapton.
Mick Jagger, as of three months ago she was having a big thing. What she was having a very big thing with Mick Jagger.  And then what happened, she was going with Eric Clapton, and Eric Clapton introduced her to Mick Jagger, and then Mick Jagger started calling her, and she ended up going with Mick Jagger.  And then she dropped Mick Jagger for Donald, and that's where it is right now.  And again, he's not making any commitments to Carla either just so you understand.
Well, they just get along very good and she's very pretty and all of that stuff.  But, you know, he doesn't have any idea who she is, right?  When he meets the right woman, it's going to be a great relationship and it's going to be a very, you know, because he believes strongly in the marriage concept.  In all fairness, he was married for 12 years and he was happily married for 12, you know, for many of those years, I guess, and he believes in it, especially in this society today, I can tell you.  But he believes in it.
He lives in Trump Tower.  He has the apartment at the top of Trump Tower.
She has an apartment at Trump Tower, but the court order is that she has to leave within a period of less than a year.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, Ivanka, thank you very much. And I'm thrilled to join you for the inaugural meeting of the National Council for the American Worker. We've done some incredible numbers, and we'll have some of those folks speaking about that in a little while. But numbers that nobody thought -- at least this quickly -- we've been here less than two years, and nobody can believe the numbers they're seeing.
A lot of it's the spirit of the country. You look at all of the polling coming out, people are more optimistic about our country and about business than they have been in many, many years. In some cases, since the beginning of these polls.
I also want to take a moment to send our thoughts to the incredible people of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and everyone else affected by Hurricane Florence.
The federal government has dispatched nearly 20,000 federal and military personnel to assist in the response and recovery effort. These are incredible people. They're really putting their lives at stake and they're putting their lives on the line every single day. They're out there for many, many hours out of a 24-hour day, and they're working hard.
Every relevant federal resource is marshaled to help those in need. Many lives have been saved already. You've been covering it, actually, very fairly. But the job they're doing is incredible.
I just want to finish that by saying our administration is in constant contact with local and state authorities, and we will not rest until that job is done, and done perfectly.
I just want to thank all of the first responders, the FEMA folks, and everybody else involved, including law enforcement. They have been incredible. And it's a very, very dangerous situation. You have collapses, you have slides; you have things that are happening that are very scary. That's why all of a sudden they're getting calls from people that we wish they didn't stay but they stayed. And they're going in and they're saving their lives. A lot of lives have been saved. So I want to thank them very, very much. We appreciate it.
We're here today to talk about workforce development. And I'd like to begin by thanking Ivanka and all of the folks around this table who have worked tirelessly in the devotion of ensuring that no American worker is going to be left behind.
Our country is doing better possibly than -- we can say, in an economic front -- than it's ever done before. We don't want to leave workers behind. And that won't happen. Most are going with it and doing really well. Nobody is going to be left behind.
I also want to thank Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary Alex Acosta, Director Mick Mulvaney, and Administrator Linda McMahon. They have been working along with Ivanka and a whole group of people -- large group of people -- on workforce development, and it's really making a big, big difference, because we have companies moving into our country like probably never before. In many cases, they're moving back. They left years ago and they're coming back because they all want a part of the action. Our country is hot and it's successful, and people want to be here.
We've created more than 4 million jobs since the election, with more than 200,000 jobs created just last month alone. More Americans are employed than ever before in our country. In the history of our country, today -- as of today -- we have more people working than they have ever had working before.
Middle class income reached its all-time high. That just came out, that number. And it reached it by all a lot. Jobless claims are at their lowest level in nearly 50 years. Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election. Now, that's a big, beautiful number. There are a record number of job openings, and the number of workers quitting their current jobs has hit at an all-time high. Now, that doesn't sound good, but actually, it is good. They're leaving jobs because they're getting better jobs and they're getting more money.
So that's a statistic, Linda, that I wouldn't say sounds great, but it is great.
They're all looking for better jobs. They're going up and they're getting more money. Before my election, less than half of the manufacturers were optimistic about the future. Today -- so think of that: less than half, meaning they weren't very optimistic -- today's number is exactly 95 percent, and I expect that's going to go higher too. That's a big, big number because people go out and they invest because they're optimistic about our country. And that means jobs and it means a lot of other things.
Thanks to the work of everybody around this room, employers across the country have taken our Pledge to American Workers and they've committed to training more than 4.2 million American workers for American jobs.
We have so many companies that are just incredible, what they're doing. The money they're spending on the training programs are incredible. Frankly, you wouldn't be able to do it through government, the quality of training. You wouldn't be able to do it as a government program. These companies are really something. And you know the list of companies -- they're really a ""who's who"" of companies in this world, in our world and in our country. And I want to thank them. A couple of them have been picking up training for over 900,000 people. That's really something to see.
The task of the council is to develop a national strategy to ensure that all American students and workers have access to affordable results-driven education, preparing them to fill the jobs of the future and to make a great, great living; to make, frankly, more money than they've ever made before; and to enjoy their job more than they've ever done before. It's very exciting.
In this mission, we are partnering with the private sector to identify the most innovative on-the-job training programs that will provide our citizens with the skills that they need to thrive and to grow. We believe in vocational education -- very important word. I've asked to be -- to have that word brought back. When I was young, I remember seeing schools -- they were called ""vocational schools,"" where people that had great talent at mechanical things, fixing engines, and laying brick, and plumbing and electricity, and electric. These were incredibly talented people. People going to college with me didn't have their talent for that -- and never would have their talent for that.
So, vocational is very important, and these are some of the best jobs in our country. So we believe in vocational education. We believe in lifelong learning. And we believe in saving taxpayer dollars while producing greater results for our workers. That is having the private sector train millions and millions of people for future jobs. Because it's different; jobs are much different today than they were even 10 years ago.
So I want to thank every member of the National Council for the American Worker. Really, a great group of people. And I want to thank you very much for being here and working so hard. Together we will build the greatest vocational programs so that American workers can follow their dreams, earn a great living, and enjoy a truly rewarding career.
I just want to say that so many companies are coming back, and many of these companies have agreed to train their worker so that we don't even have to get government involved, other than making the process a little bit easier and a little bit better. It's a really great thing to see. Millions and millions of jobs. And these are highly skilled jobs, in many cases.
So I want to thank you all. I think I might just go around and ask a couple of the folks at the table where things are going, where they see it. We have a tremendously talented guy, Kevin Hassett, who has, along with me, predicted where we'd be now. And as you know, we hit 4.1 GDP, and that was adjusted upward to 4.2. And I think we're going to have a lot of great quarters, hopefully even much higher than that.
But if we would have said during the campaign that we were going to be in the fours, people would have sort of smiled or laughed, or said we're not -- you know, we must be kidding. If you look at where we were, we were really at one, and we were heading down. I think we would have been minus-four or five, because that's where we were.
We loosened up regulations. We have better regulations. But -- and frankly, I think, in many ways, Kevin, they're tougher than they were. But you don't have to go through 10 years of a process and then find out you can or can't do something. So it's been a great thing. Kevin, could you just say a few words about the economy?
And the economic numbers are even much better than we thought.
We don't mind. I'd like to ask Alex Acosta, Secretary of Labor, to say a few words, please.
And, Alex, I think importantly, wages -- for the first time in many, many years, wages are going up and people are able to make more money doing a job that they like because they have options now. They have -- they'll look at 5 or 6 or 10 jobs, and they'll take the one they like, and they'll make more money. Not just a money thing, but they'll also get paid more. That's the first time in many years. Could you just mention the association health plans that we're doing too? Because I think it's very important.
It's working out to be a very big deal, and they're getting great, great healthcare at a very low cost. And you're coming out with another plan very soon that's going to be similar.
One other thing. As you know, we have the remnants of Obamacare. One of the things that I'm very proud of is that we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a disaster for Obamacare and a disaster for people, where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance and healthcare.
But the thing that I really am very happy to announce is that the rates are far lower than they would have been under the previous administration, or under a Democrat administration. We're holding the rates down. So that remnant is being able to -- the remnant of Obamacare is much less expensive than people thought.
They were going up, before I got here, at 118 percent, in some cases; 150 percent, 160 percent, 55 percent. We have the percentage going up at a much lower level because we're managing it very, very carefully. So we're very proud of that. Linda McMahon, could you say few words, please?
Thank you. Mick Mulvaney, could you say something and maybe respond to that?
Thank you very much. Wilbur? Thank you, Mick.
Great. Thank you very much, Wilbur. And I want to say, as per what all of you basically were saying, we have some tremendous trade deals coming along. Mexico, we're largely finished. It's being papered. But we have a wonderful relationship, and I think we have a great deal for both. We had a very unfair NAFTA deal. It was a terrible deal for this country for many years between Mexico and Canada. It was a horrible, horrible deal. We lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. And that's not going to happen anymore.
But we have a really great deal with Mexico, and I think great for both of us. Very, very pro-jobs. Very pro-everything for both countries. So we look forward to that. That's in the process of -- the deal is made. It's in the process of getting concluded. We'll see what happens with Canada. We've told them what we have to have, and we'll see how that goes. I'm sure it will go fine. And so we're working on that.
China is now paying us billions of dollars, and we will see how that all works out. It's a -- I have great respect for President Xi, as you know. I was over there for two days with him. I have a lot of respect for China. But last year, we lost $375 billion in deficits, and we had, in my opinion, way over $500 billion in cash. And that's not including certain items that we won't even talk about.
So we're not going to lose that. We can't do that. We can't do that anymore. It should have been done many years ago. It should have been done by other Presidents. And actually, it's a disgrace that it wasn't done.
So China is now paying us billions of dollars in tariffs, and hopefully we'll be able to work something out. We'll be having an announcement tonight after close of market, and that will take place. Pretty comprehensive statement. Kevin may speak and Larry Kudlow may speak a little bit at that time. But some very positive news. I think it's going to work out very well with China. I think they want to make a deal. They do want to make a deal -- that I can tell you. They want to make a deal.
But from our standpoint, it has to be fair. It has to take care of our workers. We can't have them pinpointing our farmers, because they think that weakens me a little bit because our farmers are the great -- they are incredible patriots. They understand what's happening. The markets were closed to them. Vast markets were closed to them. And the farmers have been hurting for 15 years. If you look at soybeans, the pricing before the election, for five years, it was cut in half. And so we're going to open up markets.
The EU, we're moving along. They didn't want to talk because they had such a great deal. And last year, they made $151 billion off the United States. And they had tremendous trade barriers, and we'll see what happens. But as you know, they want to make a deal very much. And we'll see if we're going to be able to make a deal with them. But there's a good chance that we can.
And no matter where you look, we have new deals going -- new trade deals. And that's going to have a huge impact on our country. It's going to have a huge impact on jobs. Going to open up markets that weren't opened before. And if they don't want to do that, that's okay. Then we're just going to have to charge them when they sell their products to us. And our Treasury will take in tremendous amounts of money, which is great for our country. And we'll create jobs. So that's all very important.
And you know, what's going to happen is businesses will start moving back into the United States, which to me is -- that's the dream. The businesses are going to pour back into the United States. That's jobs, that's a lot of other things; that's a lot of taxes coming to us. And product will start being made here again.
You remember the old days? We used to make our product, Kevin, right? Now we buy our product from everybody else. And frankly, we can make it here. And ultimately, if you include the fact that we have to have jobs and others things to do it, it will be far better economically.
But we'll see what happens as to whether or not we're able to do something in particular with China. That's a big one -- because the losses have been staggering for so many years for our country. And we just can't let that happen anymore.
So I want to thank you all for being here. I want to congratulate the people around the table for what you've done with respect to workforce. We really need workers. I mean, with the companies coming in like they're coming in, we need workers. One of the things we'll be doing at the border is we want people to come into our country, but they have to be qualified. They have to be merit-based. I want merit-based people.
Right now, 60 percent over the last 10 years -- you take a look -- 60 percent or, let's just say, so I get it exactly perfectly, large, large numbers -- a large percentage of the people coming into our country immediately go into welfare or relief. And a lot of times they never work. And we have some very foolish policies in our country. We have to end that. We want people to come into our country. We want them to come in through merit so they can work for all of these massive companies that are coming back -- in many cases, coming back to the United States.
So thank you very much. And we're very proud of the people around this table. And, Ivanka, I want to thank you for your leadership, also. You have done a fantastic job of putting everything together. And, Chris, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
Thank you everybody.
Judge Kavanaugh is one of the finest people that I've ever known. He's an outstanding intellect, an outstanding judge. Respected by everybody. Never had even a little blemish on his record.
The FBI has, I think, gone through a process six times with him over the years where he went to higher and higher positions. He is somebody very special. At the same time, we want to go through a process. We want to make sure everything is perfect, everything is just right.
I wish the Democrats could have done this a lot sooner, because they had this information for many months and they shouldn't have waited until literally the last days. They should have done it a lot sooner. But with all of that being said, we want to go through the process.
One thing I will say is that, as I understand it, Judge Kavanaugh spent quite a bit of time with Senator Feinstein, and it wasn't even brought up at that meeting. And she had this information. So you would have thought, certainly, that she would have brought it up at the meeting, not wait until everything is finished and then have to start a process all over again.
But with all of it being said, we want to go through a full process. I have great confidence in the U.S. Senate and in their procedures and what they're doing. And I think that's probably what they're going to do. They'll go through a process and hear everybody out.
I think it's important. I believe they think it's important. But again, he is one of the great intellects and one of the finest people that anybody has known. You look at his references; I've never seen anything quite like it. So they'll go through that process and we'll get it done.
I don't know. It depends on the process. I'd like to see a complete process. I'd like everybody to be very happy. Most importantly, I want the American people to be happy, because they're getting somebody that is great. I want him to go in at the absolute highest level. And I think to do that, you have to go through this. If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay. It shouldn't certainly be very much.
But again, this is something that should have been brought up long before this. They had the information in July, as I understand it. That's a long time ago. And nobody mentioned it until the other day. It's very -- you know, it's very unfortunate that they didn't mention it sooner.
But with all of that being said, it will, I'm sure, work out very well. You're talking about an individual who is as high a quality individual as you'll ever see.
I have not spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
Next question. What a ridiculous question that was.
Say it?
Oh, I think he's on track, yeah. I mean, I think he's very much on track. If they delay it a little bit just to make sure everybody is happy -- they want to be happy.
I can tell you, the Republican senators want to be 100 percent happy themselves. They're doing it very, very professionally. Again, this should have been brought up a long time ago. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.
Yeah, you're going to see on China today, right after close of business, we'll be announcing something. And it will be a lot of money coming into the coffers of the United States of America. A lot of money coming in. But you'll be seeing what we're doing right after close of business today -- the markets closing. Thank you.
You'll see. Thank you very much.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you, everybody, thank you. I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you.
It's so great to be here in Florida. My second home with you. This is a state I truly love. This is a state where we all had great victory together. Thank you.
It's now been a month since my inauguration. And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again. I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me.
I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people. This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else. This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you. I promise you that. I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.
I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news. The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years. They don't get it. By they're starting to get it. I can tell you that. They've become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that. They don't get away with it.
They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, “nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.” “Truth itself,” he said, “becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,” that was June 14, my birthday, 1807. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.
We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.
We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver. I promise that. And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time. The White House is running so smoothly. So smoothly. And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess. That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.
We will have strong borders again, and I mean that. You've seen it in television. You've seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job. You're seeing it. The gang members, bad, bad people. I said day one, and they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from.
The fact is, you want great schools for your children. You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families. You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.
It will be repealed and replaced. For those people. The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast. Okay? Nothing to complain about. Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.
You want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal. We're going to put the miners back to work. The miners go back to work.
You want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.
You want fair trade deals and a level playing field. We don't have a level playing field. Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. It's not going to happen any longer.
You want lower taxes. Less regulation. Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, “Made in the USA.” You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America. And harder for companies to leave. We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired. We're moving to another country. We're going to make the product. Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful. Not going happen anymore.
We're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave. They will never, ever leave.
And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office. They're not leaving. And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers. You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest. You want a government that keeps its promises.
A great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it. it's sweeping all across the country. Look at what's happening to the stock market. Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. It's sweeping across the country. And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs. They're going to start highs. It's going to be a new day in America. You're going to be proud again.
Jobs are already starting to pour back in. They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time. Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country. In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.
I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it. We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one. None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand. Get mired in and we can't do anything about it. By the way, NAFTA and so many others.
My administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers. We're going to end it.
Within a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs. And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe? Who makes the pipe? Something this audience understands very well, right? Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said not anymore. I put a little clause in the bottom. The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.
We believe in two simple rules. I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger. For the big planes. And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd. Not one. Not one. They won't show the crowd. You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.
And just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One. Can you believe this? I said no way. I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse. So I got Boeing and it is actually — a lot of people don't know. The Air Force One project is actually two planes. Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. I told Boeing it's not good enough. We're still not going to do it. The price is still too high. On the fighter jet. We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. Seven years late, great plane. A great plane.
So think of it. They're seven years late. Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget. Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well. And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way. I also got Boeing in. I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer. And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them. They would have signed contracts. So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump. That I can tell you. You might as well know about it. Nobody talks. By the way, that's for fighter jets. One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation. The order for the F-35. You've been reading about it because it was a disaster. Under the last administration. A disaster. And now we have it running beautifully.
In fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great. Great guy. When he came over, he said, thank you. I said for what. You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet. Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation. So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good. Okay. That's good. I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?
But we believe in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. We believe it. We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. And by the way, a new director was just approved. Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time. Incredible people.
Scott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency. He'll do so good. He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected. They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly. For the most part, they're going to be accepted. They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary. He will be amazing. We're very happy. That took place yesterday. That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations. It was impossible to navigate for companies.
And what did it really mean? Forget about the companies? What did it mean. It meant no jobs. It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here. So we're going to have a whole big situation. We are going to unfreeze all of those companies. They are going to be — they're going have freedom. Be able to build what they want to build. It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before. That's going to happen. That was a big thing.
We're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement. We're standing up. And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up. I don't say for me. I'm the messenger folks. I'm the messenger. They stood up for us in this last election. We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military. Basically people they wear uniforms like us. Isn't that nice. I saw this man on TV just now, you. I just saw him on television. He said I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do. That's my guy right there. Come here. Come here. No, I just. I'm coming in. That's okay.
Let him up. I'm not worried about him. I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss. I'm not worried about anything else. This guy is so great. He was one of many people. They're interviewing people in the line. And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man. Come on up here. Come on up. Guy was great. Hop over the fence. Come on. He can do it. He's in good shape. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on. This guy is great. Don't worry about him. No, no. Come here. They're going to — come on up. Come here.
This guy. So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.
Say a couple of words to this crowd.
A star is born.
I wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. Great guy. And so many others. I see some others. Being interviewed. I see them over here. They started. They came at 4 in the morning. The media will give them no credit. The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.
All the way outside of this — this is a big a hanger as you get. All the way outside. Way back to the fences. Amazing. I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.
I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them. We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now. It's very unfair what's happening. So we want to cherish our law enforcement. We will always protect those who protect us.
We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities. We're going to make our inner cities safe again. Look at what's going on. Look at what's happening in Chicago. Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places. Safety is a civil right. And we will fight to make America totally safe again.
I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth. We're stopping it. We're stopping it. We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.
And I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing. And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a — yes, it's very sad. The reason is for protection and safety. So the statute is so plain and so clear.
I said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its. If you have a high school education, you can understand it. If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.
I was told. I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court. Three judges. And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television. Everything we do gets a lot of people watching. So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good. When they wrote their decision, as I understand it. Maybe I'm wrong.
They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right.
“If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama.
“He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right?
So and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up.
We had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens.
Here's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.
And we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones.
We do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that.
I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.
And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans.
We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.
No wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it.
My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen.
Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy. It's a tragedy. You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%. Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it. Obamacare doesn't work. It's become totally unaffordable. Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable. It doesn't work. And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything. Sit back for two years, let it explode. The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people. We have to fix it. And we will.
We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.
You're all part of this incredible movement. This movement that we talk about so much. That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world. It's a movement that is just sweeping. It's sweeping across our country. It's sweeping frankly across the globe. Look at Brexit. Look at Brexit. Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at. People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.
The nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth. And now we have spirit like we've never had before. It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens. Erasing national borders does not make people safer. It undermines democracy and trade prosperity. We're giving it away.
The so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages. Really they are shrinking. 18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs. Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. We don't fight to win. We fight politically correct wars. We don't win anymore. We don't win at trade. We don't win in any capacity. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again. Believe me.
And we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages. This will be change for the ages. Change like never before. To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity. We want to secure our borders and protect our workers. To rebuild our military and our infrastructure. To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities. To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce. To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation. And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation. The tired echoes of yesterday's fights. We're fighting battles that no longer help us. We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.
I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries. They're not paying their bills. They're not paying their bills. They have to help us. No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past. No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure. New circumstances demand new solutions. Americans have fought and won wars together. Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives. Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next. Stretching back to the first day of our American independence. This is our legacy. It belongs to all of you. And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.
Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts. Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country. We are all brothers and all sisters. We share one home. One destiny and one glorious American flag. We are united together by history and by providence. We will make America strong again. I promise. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Greater than ever before.
May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Jeremy Corbyn,"I thank the Prime Minister for an advance copy of the statement. In fact, I received it yesterday when she made an appeal entitled, “Seeking common ground in Parliament”. Where did she make that appeal? Not in Parliament, but in a small room just down the road.
It is now clear: the bold new deal that the Prime Minister promised is little more than a repackaged version of her three times rejected deal. The rhetoric may have changed, but the deal has not. I thank the Prime Minister for her letter, but it offers no change on a customs union, no change on single market alignment, and no dynamic alignment on environmental protections. This Government are too weak, too divided, to get this country out of the mess that they have created. For more than two years, the Prime Minister bullishly refused to consult the public or Parliament.
She did not seek a compromise until after she had missed her own deadline to leave, and by the time she finally did, she had lost the authority to deliver. That became evident during the six weeks of cross-party talks that ended last week—talks that were entered into constructively on both sides to see if a compromise was possible.
But while those talks were going on, Cabinet Minister after Cabinet Minister made statements undermining what their colleagues in the room were offering. The Foreign Secretary, the Leader of the House, the International Trade Secretary and the Treasury Chief Secretary all made it clear that they would not tolerate a deal that included a customs union, while Tory leadership contender after Tory leadership contender took it in turns to make it absolutely clear that any compromise deal would not be honoured. Therefore, no matter what the Prime Minister offers, it is clear that no compromise would survive the upcoming Tory leadership contest. The multiple leaks reported from the Cabinet yesterday show that the Prime Minister could not even get the compromise deal she wanted through her own Cabinet, and it is clear that the shrunken offer that emerged satisfied no one—not her own Back Benchers, not the Democratic Unionist party and not the Official Opposition either. No Labour MP can vote for a deal on the promise of a Prime Minister who only has days left in her job.
Even if the Prime Minister could honour her promises, the deal she is putting before us does not represent a genuine compromise. Her 10-point plan is riddled with contradiction and wishful thinking. First, the Prime Minister pretends she is delivering something new with a temporary customs union. This is not a compromise— ​it is just accepting the reality. Under the withdrawal agreement, we will already be in a temporary customs union through the transition period, which can last up to four years, and if not, we will enter the backstop, which, in effect, keeps us in a customs union, too, without any say.
Secondly, why would this House legislate for a plan that has already been comprehensively rejected by the European Union? The Government want to align with the European Union on goods to keep frictionless trade, but they also want to pursue trade deals that would undermine this process. It is simply not compatible. The technology they need to continue to pursue their Chequers plan simply does not exist. It has already been ruled out by the EU as illegal, impractical and an invitation to fraud. The Government have failed to provide any economic analysis to show that this would make us better off. Why would the House support such a chaotic and desperate approach?
Labour set out a sensible compromise plan over a year ago, including a comprehensive and permanent customs union with the EU that gives us a say, which would allow us to strike trade deals as part of the world’s biggest trading bloc, bringing investment, while maintaining the highest standards. It is credible and achievable, and the best way to protect industry, manufacturing and jobs—something that this Government are woefully indifferent to, as the latest crisis in the steel industry shows today. The Government must be prepared to step in and take a public stake to save thousands of high-skilled jobs at British Steel—a foundation industry for any major economy. Instead, the Tory obsession is for striking trade deals with the likes of Donald Trump. They prioritise chlorinated chicken, further NHS privatisation and deregulation over protecting supply chains and jobs in this country.
On workers’ rights, we have yet to see the full package the Government intend to bring forward, but many people in the trade union movement remain very sceptical. As Frances O’Grady of the Trades Union Congress said yesterday:
“This reheated Brexit deal won’t protect people’s jobs and rights.”
On environmental protections, it is clear that the Prime Minister is not offering dynamic alignment and that under her proposals the UK would fall behind in a number of areas, with only a toothless regulator under the control of the Environment Secretary in place of binding international commitments to protect our environment.
Finally, on a confirmatory vote, I am sure that nobody here will be fooled by what the Prime Minister is offering. Will she tell us now, if this offer is genuine: will she give her party a free vote on this issue or will she, as before, whip against a confirmatory referendum? If the Government truly believe this is the best deal for the economy and for jobs, they should not fear putting that to the people.
For too long, our politics has been seen through a prism of leave or remain. This is dividing our society and poisoning our democracy. It means that vital issues are being neglected—the crisis in our schools and hospitals, the housing crisis and the cruelty of social security policy and universal credit. Our country needs leadership to bring us together. However, this Prime Minister is ​not the person to do that. Throughout the last three years, she has made no attempt to unite the country. She has been focused only on keeping her divided party together—and it has not worked. Her time has now run out. She no longer has the authority to offer a compromise and cannot deliver. That is why it is time for a general election to break the Brexit deadlock and give the country a say.

Gavin Newsom,"In every circumstance when people are made eligible, they go through a very formal process of interviews and reviews that’s done in person. Because of the nature of this virus, the nature of this moment, we’re going to be changing the procedures and protocols in the executive order we lay out a strategy to begin the process of doing a video conferences. This would be a temporary advancement, but under the circumstances in terms of our isolation strategies, in order to continue the processing of people that are eligible for parole and the encouragement to make sure that that process happens at the scale it’s been happening in the past, we think it’s appropriate to move forward with those teleconferences. And that executive order lays out strategies to do just that. And so those orders will be in effect, they are in effect immediately and the protocols and procedures are in effect in real time. And we’ll talk more about that in the coming days as we look not just to the state prison population but the county jail population as well.
In addition to that, we had a remarkable day conversations with our Army Corps of Engineers. They are now stationed just right outside our SOC here at the emergency operation centers. We have three divisions throughout the state of California. They’ve been working with our state leadership, National Guard, others within our respective organizations to site through a survey process, the appropriate locations for potential support of our Army Corps. In addition to sites that we have identified through our federal medical program that we announced yesterday, and the fact that we have two sites coming up, one in Riverside and Santa Clara. We’re looking at additional sites in ways that the Army Corps can compliment the work to get those sites fully operational. And so that’s convention facilities, that’s facilities large and small up and down the state fairgrounds and the like. But we went through more detailed protocols and sharing expectations so that we can lay out exactly our expectations moving forward.
The army Corps of Engineers move quickly, and we’re very enthusiastic that that partnership has really taken shape over the course of the last week and been advanced over the course of the last few hours in more meaningful ways. Addition to that, we had a wonderful news, Sir Richard Branson, Virgin, now partnering as Tim Cook did and Elon Musk of Tesla and spaceX. Just another individual that stepped, Virgin is stepping up, bringing a 747 into the Bay Area and Oakland. And we worked on logistics related to that for a significant enhancement, personal protective gear. We’ll have more details on that in the next day or two.
Just another point of emphasis, another example, an indication of people that are stepping up in heroic ways, bringing that from Asia into the Bay Area to help support our efforts and to help support one of our largest hospital systems, Kaiser in that process. We had the tragic loss of a young life, a teenager in Lancaster, California, which underscores the enormity of the challenge in front of us, this health crisis and how it can impact anybody and everybody. I know it’s sobering when you read the headlines, some of the headlines said a child, but to be more precise, a teenager lost lives. And we are doing the investigation, trying to understand more about exactly what occurred, but COVID related tragic loss of life.
As of 10:00 AM this morning, we’ve lost 40 lives in the state of California related to COVID-19. We have lost over 2,100, or rather we have 2,100 positives in the state of California, 2,102 which was 17.5% higher than the previous day. Again, that’s a 10:00 AM number, those numbers change in real time, but a 17 and a half percent increase and now a loss of a young person’s life. I want to just make a point to emphasize this and extend my heartfelt sympathies to the family and the community that has lost their loved one but also make this point, young people can and will be impacted by this virus. In fact, young people disproportionately are the ones testing positive in the state of California, 50% of the 2,102 individuals that have tested positive, 50% are between the age of 18 and 49.
I’ll repeat that. Half of those that have tested positive to date in the state of California are 18 to 49 years old. This disease impacts everybody, the question is the acuity and the hospitalization rate that yes does skew on the side of older populations. But with this tragic now death, it is a reminder to everybody to take this seriously. It’s a health crisis, it needs to be met first and foremost head on as such. And that’s why it is incumbent upon all Californians to continue to take our stay at home order seriously, to continue to do the kind of social distancing that common sense dictates and to heed the warnings we advanced yesterday to stay out of settings like beaches and parks where you’re coming into close contact with others, practice social distancing. And we had to step up our enforcement yesterday as it relates to shutting down those parking facilities as a consequence to reinforce and remind people the seriousness of the moment, but what more evidence do you need of a loss of a young person’s life?
And so I just cannot impress upon the young people out there more the seriousness of this moment and how critical they are to ultimately getting us on the other side by practicing that social distancing that we all are accustomed to hearing but not in every case advancing individually. By the way, for those that are curious, 26% of individuals, 50 to 64 are represented in the 2,102 individuals that have been tested positive. 23% of all the other cases are represented in individuals North of 65 years old. The hospitalization rates tend to skew higher in those cohorts, but the number of positives again remains half 18 to 49. So broad strokes, that’s been most of the day as it relates to operationalizing a lot of the work that we’ve been talking about in the last number of days.
I had a number of conversations with governors across the country about protocols and procedures to better work collaboratively on procurement strategies. We actually are lining up and linking together our procurement teams with other states to make sure that we’re not competing with one another. We’re making sure we are price conscience and dealing with the issue of price gouging, comparing best practices with state attorney generals, not just the work that the federal government is doing, William Barr and others that we were pleased to hear announced yesterday. So those are good conversations, and those conversations we hope will be made real in terms of organizing in a more deliberative and strategic way. The procurement of the hundreds of millions of individual items that we need to procure, and shields and gloves and gowns and coveralls and face mask and swabs and the like.
We have testing numbers, the testing has significantly increased across this country, but also in the state of California. Tomorrow we’ll be laying out the new numbers that we have received that will show a significant jump in the numbers we’ve made public as we’ve brought together all of these one-off collection sites and all of the hospitals, research universities that are participating as well as the private labs. And we’ll have a new process to collect those numbers in real time to bring to light I think more comforting numbers on the scale of testing. It’s still not close to where we need to be, we still need more swabs, we still need more reagents, these RNA extraction kits. But we are seeing higher throughput, and we’re seeing new technologies coming to bear, we’re testing, we’re working with the FDA, Trump administration to get out of the market one.
I was meeting with folks today that have a 45-minute test because the issue now is not just swab and RNA extraction and reagents, it’s about turning around the tests which are in some cases taking days and days and days. Some cases, many is seven, eight, nine days. And so we’re going to have to address the timeliness of the diagnostic and the test results as well. Again, you constantly have to iterate in this space as we’ve moved from just public labs to those commercial quest and LabCorp now to needing specimen samples, swabs in the media associated with that to now making sure we turn around these tests in a much quicker time, but more on that tomorrow. We also, in closing, have done a lot on the ventilator side of things.
I mentioned yesterday the heroic work of Elon Musk who came through on his promise to deliver over 1,000 ventilators, and that was announced yesterday. We brought in ourselves, we just got another 1,010 ventilators from the private sector. We’re working with Bloom Energy and others to convert that cash of 514 ventilators that we had to refurbish them and to get them fully operational. We have received from the federal government no direct ventilators from the National Stockpile. Los Angeles County did receive 170, and they have a unique relationship to the National Stockpile, but that’s all we received within the state of California proper. But we’re not discouraged by that, we are encouraging the federal government and we have direct orders and asks in to do more on the ventilators. But we are doing everything we can to orient our efforts around the world to get more ventilators in the state. About 3,000 we’ve been able to bring online a community college system.
I was talking to the head of the community college system, which also have been heroic as they provided just as one example, 60 ventilators. And they’re also keeping by the way all of us safe because just remember the community college system is the backbone of our training in the state of California by some estimates, 70% of our first responders however one would define them, are trained through that community college system and they’re doing heroic work in this state as well. I only offer that because of the conversations we had today. They deserve to be highlighted. Protocols continue to make sure that we have safe logistics and supply chain. We’re working with our egg community, we’re working with those that are warehousing our food, making sure those supermarket shelves are stocked. I know people are calling in concerned not just about toilet paper, bread and the like.
I’ve had some very comforting conversations from grocers, their representatives and the egg community that they feel like they’re up to the task to meet this moment. There’s some protocols shifting away from, in some cases, choice to quantity as purchasing habits are changing and some of the procedures and protocols around distribution channels are also changing. The supply chains are changing in real time. But as you know, we are supplementing our workforce in that respect and making sure that people know there are over 10,000 jobs available for our grocers, and that’s an area they’re hiring. And I know people want to hear that because our unemployment insurance system is being overwhelmed, and I want folks to know we’ve made some real shifts on staffing today. We’ll be doing a lot more in the coming days to meet the demands.
It’s now averaged over the last seven days because of a huge increase, even yesterday of 114,000. It’s the seven day rolling average to the number unemployment insurance claims that have been requested. And the state remember averaged before this crisis about 2,500. So we had a very robust conversation today with our team to make sure that we are re-purposing our workforce and making sure we’re moving things around to make sure we adequately are addressing the UI requests that are coming in. So that’s a broad strokes and update on where we are today and tomorrow, we’ll be talking a lot more about economic issues, mortgage related issues for closure related issues, update on the testing, and of course, I’m here for our Facebook friends to answer any questions you have this evening as well.
Yeah. Well, the question of whether California will open in April, let me be sober about that. I’m not Pollyannaish about any of these things. I referenced the 17.5% increase in the number of positives. I talked about the fact that our testing protocols have significantly increased, but I also mentioned that not all those tests are back. Thousands and thousands of people have been tested who are waiting for their results, and we clearly based upon the curve have a lot more work to do. If Californians continue to do more and do better as they have … And I’m really proud of, look, this state started on this journey working originally with the federal government on the repatriation flights from overseas. And we started a socialized covert ID in the state of California before probably any other state because of that unique repatriation strategy was highlighted during the Grand Princess efforts. And I’m very proud of those efforts.
So we didn’t have a Diamond Princess issue, the Grand Princess we were able to work as well to highlight this issue in the region. We went forward with those stay at home orders for our seniors very earlier on in this process. And of course, California moved formerly with the cities and regions leading first and then as a state at scale with the stay at home orders. So we’re trying to bend that curve, but we haven’t bent it. And so the question is April, early April I think that would be misleading to represent at least for California that that will be the case.
I’ve said this very honestly and objectively based upon all of the expertise and experts that are here assembled and those we contact and work with that the next six to eight weeks will be pivotal and will be determinative in terms of being able to make adjustments and be able to reset expectations. I said eight to 12 weeks because soberly we look out over the course of 8 to 12 weeks and I think we can continue to do what we’ve done. If we do that, hopefully then we’ll be in a very different place than we are today. But I think April for California would be sooner than any of the experts that I talked to would believe is possible.
Well, my message to people buying toilet paper is a get what you need not more than you need. I’ve got a family of four and we scurried around a few different grocery stores, and they were out and we finally found toilet paper. I will just say this, no reason to hoard the toilet paper. All the folks I talked to, I had deep conversations, not just passing conversation, casual conversations with the grocers, with all our supply chain. And I’m confident in our capacity to deliver toilet paper. But if you’re going to do massive hoarding, it just makes it more challenging in certain locations in this state. So just be thoughtful not just about your own needs, but also be thoughtful about the needs of others.
We’re getting those direct stats. In fact, the hospitalization number, those stats, we’re going to have more formal stats on that tomorrow.
Well, we have a very detailed site, covid19.ca.gov that lays out what is essential and non-essential. We put together a very comprehensive list working with health directors throughout the state of California, working with counties, working with city leaders throughout the state. In fact, I was talking to one other governor today that had a recent stay at home order comparing and contrasting notes, what worked, what didn’t, what was most controversial, what wasn’t. So it’s a sheet that is iterative, and it’s a sheet that is available, a comprehensive list that’s available. And I encourage people to go to the covid19.ca.gov website to learn more. And when in doubt, go to your county health department that also has those resources available that will localize them in a way that also I think could guide a more direct answer to that question.
So that’s it in a nutshell. We’ll be back tomorrow to more formally update everybody on where we are. Everybody stay safe, most importantly stay healthy, and let’s continue to meet this moment as California is leading in terms of these efforts. Let us continue to lead and let us continue to lean forward to recognize our responsibility. Let us not have to once again announce that a teenager lost their lives because we didn’t take this moment seriously. Let us take this moment seriously and soberly. Let’s live our lives, but let’s do it by being thoughtful about how we meet this moment. Take care everybody.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Vice President Mike Pence. Great job you're doing, and hello Toledo. We love Toledo. You remember I was here a lot. You remember 2016, what a year that was, right? And 2020 is going to be even better, no doubt. But I'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great State of Ohio.
And as we begin the new year, our economy is booming, wages are soaring, workers are thriving, and America's future has never ever looked brighter, never. With the envy of every country in the world, we've created 7 million brand new jobs since our election, and we will soon be replacing the disaster known as NAFTA, with the incredible brand new USMCA.
The historic victory for Ohio farmers, workers, and manufacturers, but really, a great victory for the United States. It's an incredible agreement. You remember, I came and I'd talked about it. I'd always talk about how bad our trade deals are. We did a brand new one with Korea. So now, we have South Korea.
We just finished a big one, $40 billion with Japan. On January 15th, we're signing a monster, a big beautiful monster, $40 to $50 billion to our farmers. That's -- our farmers will take it in. I keep saying, go buy larger tractors. Go buy larger tractors. I said this, no way. I don't know if you know the story.
My people wanted $20 billion of purchase, right? $20 billion, $20 billion, that's a lot of money. It's a lot of corn, $20 billion, and I said, make it $50 billion. China's very big and they said, OK. They said, sure the farmers can't produce that much. I said, let the farmers tell me that. Tell them to go out, remember?
And buy a bigger what? Tractor. Buy a bigger tractor. The old producer. So, $40 billion to $50 billion of agricultural product and the manufacturers and the car companies, and we've brought a lot of car companies into Ohio, you know that. A lot of them coming in, a lot of them have already been brought in. They're coming in from Japan.
They're coming in from all over the world. This is where they want to be. They want to be in the United States. That's where the action is. They're all coming back. I used to go around talking about how everyone's leaving. They were all leaving. A lot of you are victims of that leaving. These companies would leave.
They'd go to Mexico. They'd go to Canada. They'd close up, they'd buy from China. Now, they're all coming back, new ones, old ones, they're all coming back, and many are coming right here to Ohio. And just in case you didn't know it, Ohio just had the best year, economically, in the history of your state.
That's not bad, that's not bad, and this year's going to be even better and maybe much better. But weeks ago, I signed the largest ever investment in the United States military, $738 billion, and we created the sixth branch of the United States armed forces, the space force, and everybody's excited about that.
. Some of it's still coming in. We have everything. We've got new planes, we've got new rockets, missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in, $2.5 trillion in new investments.
Our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before. And if you remember three years ago, when I took over, we were depleted, our military was totally depleted. And by the way, speaking of our military, have we taken care of our vets with Choice, choice with Choice, that was a big thing? You know, I used to go around and the VA was a terrible situation.
People would wait weeks -- he's right, he said, yes, it was right. You don't hear too much about that anymore. Do you notice? Choice and accountability. Do you know what accountability is? For 44 years, they tried to get accountability. That's somebody bad, works for the VA, you couldn't fire them, you couldn't fire them.
They could be sadistic. They could be thieves. They could be whatever they were. You couldn't get rid of them. We got accountability approved, and now we say, you're fired, get out. We get somebody and that's good. 44 years, and maybe most importantly of all, is Choice. VA veterans Choice. So now, you wait in line and a lot of times you'd be waiting in line for four or five or six weeks, you couldn't see a doctor.
Now you have to wait. You go out to a private doctor, you get yourself taken care of, we pay the bill. What a difference it's made. What a difference it's made. That's OK. They got it. They got it.  They go home to mommy, going home to mommy.
They're going home to mommy. It's a beautiful sight. Thank you, security. Do we love law enforcement, by the way? So with the VA, I used to go around say why don't they do that? Why don't these people -- why don't they go to a private doctor to work something out? And I thought it was a brilliant plan. I said I'm telling you.
I am such a smart guy. I said this is the most brilliant thing ever and I went back to my people and I said, you know, I have an idea. If veterans are sick, they can't get the kind of service they need or they need a certain kind of a doctor. I have an idea. It's such a great idea. You're going to go out private.
You're going to pick up a doctor. You're going to get yourself fixed up. We're going to pay the bill, right? And you know what happened? And I said how, how brilliant is that? They say, sir, we've been working on that for 48 years, but we've never been able to get it approved. I was very, very disillusioned.
But you know what I'm good at? Getting things approved and we got it approved. So, we signed that 11 months ago and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health. People would wait online for weeks and some people weren't very sick, and then, end up being terminally ill.
They couldn't get to see a doctor. Now they go out, they get a doctor, we take care of them. We take care of our vets.  So, we're using this great power, not to pursue conflict, but to really preserve -- and I mean, in the truest sense of the word, preserve peace. We have this tremendous military and you know what that is? That is really a great fighting force, but I hope we never have to use it. I really do. You saw an example.
You saw an example of that a couple of days ago. So, we seek friends, not enemies. But if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril. We've never had -- we've never had a military. What we have now, we've never had anything like it. You know, we were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50-, 60-year old planes.
You've heard this story. The grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them. Those are all gone now, folks.  Those are all gone. In October of last year, U.S. Special Operations Forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the blood-thirsty founder and leader of ISIS.
The animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead and the entire ISIS caliphate is destroyed, and his terrorist empire, and he was indeed a monster, has been totally demolished. We killed thousands and thousands of ISIS warriors fighters, and we have thousands of them right now locked up, where they should be. Nobody has ever done what we've done in three years.
And I'll say this, when we took it over, it was a mess. We did it in a short period of time, but when we took it over, it was not good. And last week, the United States once again took the bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice, and you know what I'm talking about.  For years, these sadistic mass murderer, Qasem Soleimani, planned and executed attacks against American targets, killing and wounding thousands of U.S. service members, and many, many thousands and even hundreds of thousands of other people.
As the leader of Iran's terrorist Quds Force, Soleimani spread death, destruction, and mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. He ordered the violent assault on the American embassy in Baghdad, and you saw -- this was the anti-Benghazi. We got there very quickly. We got there very quickly. This is the exact opposite.
We did it exactly the opposite of Benghazi, where they got there so late. All they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from days before. It's all they saw. We got there very early. We saw what was happening. I saw what was happening. I said what's that all about? And that was going to be another Benghazi had they broken through the final panels of glass.
They were breaking it, breaking it. Had they gotten through, we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages. That wasn't going to happen and I called up our great generals. I said, get them over there now. And one of our leaders, one of our really admired people said, sir, we'll have them there tomorrow.
I said, no, get in the planes right now. Have them there immediately and they got there immediately. Fortunately. But he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four American service members, badly wounded, and killed an American citizen that was just before we happened to hit him. Soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in Baghdad, but we stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.
So at my direction, the United States military eliminated Qasem Soleimani and ended his rampage through, not only that part of the world but much bigger parts of the world. He was all over. He was a bad guy. He was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror. He's dead. And yet now, I see the radical Left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist.
. You know, he was the king of the roadside bomb.  Do you know what the roadside bomb? And then, they got bigger and he'd send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq.
And when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors, when you see them without their legs or without an arm, and with so much damage, it's most likely that he caused that damage, because that's what he liked. He loved planting the roadside bomb. So now, he's gone and that's a good thing.
.S. military strike on Soleimani, the world's top terrorist, think of it, the world's top terrorist, and we're having people like Nancy Pelosi. It's a real genius. Nancy, Nancy, nervous Nancy, but here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military, whoever was in his way.
And we have Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, we have them all. They're all trying to say, how dare you take him out that way? You should get permission from Congress. You should come in and tell us what you want to do. That's a lot of -- that's a lot of corruption back there, folks.
. So they want me -- so you know, these are split-second decisions. You have to make a decision. So, they don't want me to make that decision.  They want me to call up, maybe go over there. Let me go over to Congress. Come on over to the White House, let's talk about it. When can you make it? Well, I won't be able to make it today, sir, how about let's say, a couple of days.
Oh, sure, come on over. Now, we got a call. We heard where he was, we knew the way he was getting there, and we had to make a decision. We didn't have time to call up Nancy, who is not operating with a full deck. Now, they want us to call. Can you imagine calling crooked Adam Schiff? He's so crooked. He's so crooked.
. Listen, we have the world's No. 1 terrorist, killed thousands and thousands of people. We'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution. Would you be willing to meet? Well, I won't be able to make it this week. Well, you know, he's traveling fast.
We got to get lined up, Adam, you little pencil neck, nine inches. He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it's loose. Now, come on Adam, we got to meet faster, Adam. We got him lined up. We got to take this guy out, we're not going to have another shot at a baby ever again. But, but I can't make it now because I'm trying to impeach Trump.
I'm trying to impeach -- even though he did nothing wrong. By the way, did you see? I did nothing wrong. They don't even know what the hell is going on. In fact, it's so weak. She doesn't want to put in the articles, it's so weak. They're, so pathetic. They're so pathetic. So, they want us to call them. Now, Schiff is a big leaker.
You know, he leaks to crazy CNN, see, with a little red light on. So, he'll say it, you know, off the record, I got to hurry up because everyone's watching me in the hallway of my cellphone. Off the record, they've got the No. 1 terrorist in the world, Soleimani, and they're going to get him.
They're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes. Please don't tell anybody I told you, but so we have -- we have breaking news, President Trump within the next 20, 25 minutes, looks to be taking a terrorist, General Soleimani. He's going to do it and it should be happening about the next 20 minutes, 19, 18, 17. Then, we get back to the battlefield.
How do you do, fellas? I don't know, sir. He disappeared. I don't know what happened to him. They want us to -- they want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media. That's the way the Academy Awards used to look when it was successful.
Then, they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful. I love it. I love it, actually. Oh, they have some bad ones here tonight. They have some really bad ones, some real sick ones. Then, one good one, by the way, one good one. They have one good one, but some bad ones, very, very dishonest people, and we have some great ones too.
You know, we have some great journalists, great reporters, but you've got a tremendous number of dishonest media people, like, I have never seen in my life before. They write things that they know are wrong. They write -- if you watched for the last three years, think of it, and then, they get Pulitzer Prizes, but it turned out to be all wrong.
How do you do that? They get Pulitzer prizes for being wrong? The Pulitzer Prize doesn't mean a thing, doesn't mean a thing. I mean, I'm going to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country.
I said, what -- did I have something to do with it? Yeah, but you know that's the way it is. As long as we know, that's all that matters, OK? I saved a big war, saved a couple of them, but under my administration, we will never make excuses for America's enemies. We will never hesitate in defending American lives, and we will never stop working to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, never.
And nobody's done it like we've done it. And it's we, it's we, it's not me. It's we, it's a whole movement. There has, by the way, never been a movement like this. You know outside, I don't know what this place holds, like, 10,000 - 11,000 people, right? Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in.  There's never been a movement like this.
There's never been a movement like this. And I'll tell you, maybe, I'm wrong, but this is bigger than it was in 2016 because because in 2016, I said what we're going to do. But now, I've completed more promises than I've made. I mean, I've actually completed more than I've made, right.
But I never talked about -- did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about Space Force? We never talked about it. We did Space Force, but did we ever speak about it? No, there were many things that we've done that we never spoke about, right? Right to Try. You know about Right to Try, right? They've been trying to get it for 44 years, Right to Try.
That's people that are very sick, terminally ill, and they can't get medicine that possibly works and very well. We have the greatest labs, the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest scientists in the world with the greatest medicines in the world. If they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work, but is going to take another six years -- I brought those times way back, by the way, way down, but they would travel to Asia, they would travel to Europe, they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick.
I said wait a minute, they're going to die. They're going to die. Well, sir, we can't take the liability. I said then, we'll draw up a statement assessing all liability, taking all liability away from the country, away from the insurance companies, away from the healthcare companies, away from the doctors, and with the great help of a lot of incredible Republicans and we had some Democrats help us, we passed Right to Try, and you have to see how this has worked.
Some people are, being -- many, people are being saved. And you know, the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick because they didn't want it on their charts. I said I understand that. Then we won't include that. We'll have a separate list over here. They said, oh, would you do that?
I said, yeah, I'll do that, right? I'll do that, but I didn't talk about Right to Try. I never said I was going to get that done or we got it done. That was a tough one to get done. Sounds simple. It was tough. There's nothing easy in this country. You know, they said to me, a friend of mine, the other day, who is the toughest country to deal with, President?
He used to call me Donald.  I've known this guy for a long time. I like to say 20 years, but it's much more than that. I just don't want to tell you how long, it's too long. And I say, call me, Donald, you've always called me Donald. I can't. He calls me, Mr. President, I've known this guy forever. He used to call me, hey Don, let's go out to dinner.
You know, before he'd go, hey, let's go out to dinner. Now, he goes, Mr. President, sir, how are you, right? How are you? But what we've done, and he said, he called me -- he said what you've done, he's never seen anything like it. So many people are saying that. We are all together doing something, not only in terms of the election, not only in terms of what we're doing right now.
Don't forget, it's a long way to the election. You know, we have what, 10 months? That's a long way. This is my first stop of the year. First major stop of the year. This is it and we start, by the way, let's do one of those polls right now. Do you mind? But is there anything more fun than a Trump rally?
Here we are. Is there anything more -- ready? So, we have the greatest phrase of all time, Make America Great Again, and in all due respect, I'll never end -- I'm a little superstitious. I'll never end it, Make America Great Again. But I see all those hats, I see all those hats, changing it a little bit, but Make America Great Again.
And I said, you know today, we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country. So, your 401ks are at records, your stocks are great, but what it really means to me is jobs, more importantly, than anything else. We have the best jobs, the best everything, right? But we just hit -- so, I can't really say, Make America Great Again.
Our military is rebuilt, $2.5 trillion, our military is rebuilt, we're doing great numbers, economically, our country is the strongest it's ever been. You have factories moving back into Ohio. You never saw anything like it, right? You had your best year.  So, when I say, Make America Great Again, what that sort of means is, like, we didn't get there, but we did get there.
So now, I have a new theme, it's called Keep America Great. Keep America, right? Now, I'm a very loyal person and I am concerned about changing the theme because Make America Great Again because I think it was the greatest political campaign in history.
So, crooked Hillary, wait, crooked -- you should lock her up, I'll tell you. Crooked Hillary spent three or four times more. So, I want to be a little bit. You know, I have to say that was a great campaign and I don't want to change it. I don't want to have this incredible 2016, then go with something, and if something ever happened, oh, this country will go to hell.
Oh, I hate to see -- you know the stocks, I'm talking about records. You'll have records this way, you're going to have records, get used to it. Because if that happened, you will see things happen that aren't good.  But I have to now say, do I want to change the greatest theme in political history? Make America Great Again with Keep America Great, right?
So, so, let's take a little applause, right? We'll go Make America Great Again, you'd clap if you want that. Then we would go, Keep America Great, you'd clap if you like that, OK, are you ready? First, Make America Great Again. Keep America Great.
Do you ever see these crazy polls that come out? We're doing great in the polls, by the way. Remember I used to come out and talk about the polls? We'll start doing that very soon. We're doing great in the polls, but this is like a free poll. Somebody else would go out, they have all this money that they raised and they give somebody $1 million, and they'll ask 200 people that question.
And then, they'll say, well, Make America Great Again is better. But I will tell you, I haven't heard one thing with that was true. With all of these, I would have, I would have said instinctively, Make America Great Again, could not be beaten. I've probably done this ten times. I have never had it win, it's Keep America Great, and that's what we're doing, but we're going to use both.
We're going to use both. We're going to use both because there's no way that I'm going to jettison Make America Great, right? There's no way. We're going to use both, but this hat is a hot seller. We're selling that hat like nobody's ever sold the hat before, I will say. Oh, it's great, good. Keep America Great.
So, we're going to use both, but Keep America Great. That's probably going to be the dominant theme. They gave Iran $150 billion, including $1.7 billion in hard cold cash.
No, no, can you imagine $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in cash? So, the foolish Iran nuclear deal financed Iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout, that's what it did. And by the way, it expires so soon. They can have nuclear weapons.  They're not, as I said before, they will not have nuclear weapons.
By subsidizing Iran's malign conduct, the last administration was leading the world down the path of war. We are restoring our world to the path of peace, peace through strength, peace through strength, and our country is doing great, and I think, something is going to happen that's got to be good. You know, we've sanctioned the hell out of Iran and we just put more yesterday.
They hit us with 16 missiles, and I said, how many? We were ready to go, we were ready to go. I said how many, how many died? How many were wounded? Sir, none. None? Pretty good warning system, none. How many were hurt? How were hurt? None, sir. So, we didn't do anything. We were ready. We were ready, not that I wanted to, but we were ready, you have no idea.
A lot of people got very lucky. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many great Republican leaders, a man who has helped me right from the beginning, a very special guy, Representative Bill Johnson, Bill. Where is Bill? Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Bill. We have a lot of your Congressmen, right now in Congress, they said, sir, should we come with you?
I said, no, stay back and vote. They're voting on some pretty important stuff, right? But we were able to get Bill. We thank you, Bill, very much, great job, great warrior. Thank you, Bill. Ohio Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. Great job.  State Treasurer, Robert Sprague.
Thank you, Robert, and you have a lot more money in the bank right now, Robert, as Treasurer, right, than you ever did? Ohio Supreme Court Justice, Judy French. Thank you, Judy. Great job. State Senate President, a man highly respected, Larry Obhof. Thank you, Larry. And a woman who really has become a great friend of mine.
She took over this party. We fought like hell. We had some other people that had their mind on taking over the party, but they'd never had a chance against Jane Timken, Jane. And the man who is in charge of my campaign in Ohio, I had a choice of five people. I said I like this guy's name. I don't know why his name is Bob Paduchik.
Why do I like his name? And I said Bob, how are we doing? He said you're going to win big, sir. Because you know, you keep hearing, you cannot win unless you win the great State of Ohio, that's these guys, and once I was leading Ohio by a lot in the poll, they never said that anymore. It's terrible. They were saying it when they thought I wasn't going to win, but we were ahead right from the beginning.
But Bob was -- incredibly did a fantastic job and Bob, I'd call him up. I'd say, Bob, we don't have the Governor, we don't have the head of the Republican Party, you know, it's a minor problem, you're running as a Republican, and he punked out on us, right, this guy? We don't have any. He said, sir, you have the people.
. Is that good or bad? He said, sir, it's great. You just went up three points. Would you believe this by not having it? And he said, don't worry, sir, you're going to win, and we won by a lot.
And now, I understand we're up by a lot more than we ever thought possible. But Bob was fantastic. Thank you, Bob. And thanks to Republican leadership work, can you believe this? I have a 95% approval rating. Can you believe this? And do you know who second is? We do, we do, we do.  Do you know who second is? Ronald Reagan at 87%, Ronald Reagan.
And then, one of these characters back there, they put me in a contest with the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? So, who do you like better, Trump or Abraham Lincoln. They say they did a poll on this. I think I remember the numbers.
All I know is, we won against Abraham, Honest Abe. We won 53 to 47. Do you believe that, Abraham Lincoln? I went back to the First Lady, I said First Lady, I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll. I don't know if they had polls back there, but Abraham Lincoln. I always say I can be more Presidential than any candidate that ever ran than any President, other than maybe, Abraham Lincoln when he's wearing his hat.
But I like Abe Lincoln, but we're doing well. We have a lot of support. Do you know why? Because our country is doing so well, our country is doing so well.  And when we went out, we started and we went right to the top of the polls. It wasn't like these folks today. They are 2%, 3%, but they're claiming.
We went right to the top from day one. We never missed center stage in the debates. Remember those great debates? We actually got high ratings. They don't get very good ratings anymore. They're like, it's like death, watching, I should watch. You know, I'm supposed to watch. It's like my job. Try and watch, watch the competition, but it's like watching death.
Those debates are boring. They're boring. You got to sit through those things for two or three hours. You got to really be committed to the country to do that. I mean, you have some real beauties. Do you see where Pocahontas is slipping badly? And Bernie, Bernie has gone up.
He's gotten it wrong around four times. He goes when we took our shot at Iraq. No, no, no, they all say no, no, they're screaming. It's Iran, Iran. Ah, what, what?  And his son, right? Where's Hunter, where's Hunter. I said, we have to have where's Hunter as a witness.
They said, what do you mean where's Hunter? I said that's his first name. I have now made his first name where's, where's Hunter? Here's a guy made no money, got thrown out of the military forces. I think the Navy, got thrown out, had no job, had no nothing, so, he went from that to making millions of dollars a year, as soon as, sleepy Joe became Vice President, right?
He made millions of dollars a year. Would anybody in this room do that for millions of -- I would. We all would. He made millions and millions of dollars a year. Ukraine took care of him. How about China? He walked out with $1.5 billion to manage, and he never did it before. He didn't know anything about oil and gas.
He was making a fortune. So, where's Hunter? Where the hell are you Hunter? But I'll tell you, I sort of hope, it's Joe because he will hear where's Hunter every single debate, nine times a debate. Where's Hunter?  And then, you have Buttigieg, Buttigieg, boot, edge, edge. I, I can't -- nobody, nobody can pronounce.
Nobody has any idea how the hell to say his name. So, what they do is they call him, Mayor Pete. You know, like Mayor Pete. Here comes Mayor Pete, doesn't do a very good job. Alfred E. Neuman, you're right, howdy doody. Some people say, howdy doody, howdy doody. The problem is a lot of people don't remember Alfred E. Neuman, don't say that, you look much younger than that I must say.
So, you have Mayor Pete. I mean give me a break. Can you believe Mayor Pete? This is going to be the President of the United States. This is going to be -- how would he be against negotiating against President Xi of China? And we just made one hell of a deal. You're going to see the numbers very soon, you know.
One hell of a deal. They didn't like those tariffs. Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again and America, most importantly, is respected again, respected like never before. And you know for years, NATO has taken advantage of the United States.  We protect Europe from Russia and the numbers have been going down for many, many years, 15 years, 18 years.
The numbers is like a roller coaster down and I went over, and I said folks, you got to pay your bills, you're delinquent, you know, you're delinquent. And then, they don't like me. They say we like Obama better. They should like Obama better. Obama would go in and say, thank you very much for coming. I appreciate it. Bye-bye.
I'm going back to Washington. I'm going back. I'll be violating the carbon footprint. I'm going to Hawaii to play golf. I drive to play a round of golf and the course I own doesn't even cost them anything. He flies to Hawaii, nobody cares. If I drive 20 minutes, it's like Donald Trump is playing golf today.
He violates the carbon footprint, but, but just think of it, think of it, think of where we've come. Think of where we've come. A great congressman from Tennessee, they have -- it's a great state. They have early voting, very early voting, probably the earliest, and he said I don't know. I just left. I just left Tennessee.
This was in November. This was the election 2016. He said I just left this incredible state of mine. I love that state.  Sir, we've seen lines of people that didn't vote before because they never were inspired to vote, and these are people that never voted, and they had had so in Trump. They have pins on Trump, Trump, Trump, and Trump.
They have the bans on, you know, like a Miss Universe. It says, Trump-Pence and they've got buttons all over it. They've got shirts, saying Trump and Trump-Pence. I never saw anything like it. If every state is like Tennessee, sir, I hate to tell you, you're going to have one hell of a victory and that's what happened, right?
That's happened and you did it. You did it and I think we're going to have bigger numbers, even bigger numbers because I'll tell you what? We're a long way from the election. I think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time. I really do. You know, Elizabeth Warren sadly referred to, she of great Indian heritage.
Remember, I used to say, I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none. I turned out to be right, but you look at what she's doing, you look at what she's saying, the lies, the deceit, the fraud, you see it all. We are going to do so great. It's got to be something that's going to be special.
It's going to be for the record books. The Evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors, ministers, preachers, and they just called today. Five of the most respected people and they said things that were incredible.  They said, there's never been anything like this in the church that they can read. Some of them have been doing it for 30, 40 years.
They said we have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this President and for this Presidency, all of us like we have right now. And the great Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son, Franklin Graham, a fantastic man. He said two weeks ago, my father, Billy Graham voted for Donald Trump. He -- nobody ever. No, no, no, he never said that before.
Billy Graham wasn't somebody that would vote and say, he voted -- Franklin Graham said Billy Graham, may be the greatest of all, maybe the greatest of all time. He said my father, Billy Graham, who is very old at the time and in trouble, he was in trouble, he was not well. He voted for Donald Trump. What a great tribute that was to me.  What a great tribute, great family.
Unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years, African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever, ever, ever recorded. Wages are rising fast, they're going up very fast, and the biggest percentage increase makes me happy, are for blue-collar workers, 40 million.
Think of this, 40 million American families are now benefiting from the Republican child-tax credit, each receiving an average of over $2,200 a year. Now America lost. This is hard to believe because if you think how could it possibly be true, but this is what happened? Probably, it's the reason, number one reason I'm running, America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000. You wouldn't believe that's possible, but I know it's true because I've said it 50 times and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me. No, it's true.
No, it's true. If I were slightly off, if it were, if I was off by two factories, there'd be a headline, Donald Trump told a fib. Donald Trump gets to be a Pinocchio again.  No, think of it, 60,000 factories, plants and factories closed, closed. They went to Mexico. They went to China, 60,000. It's not even -- I look, take a look at a map and put 60,000 a little tax.
I mean, you wouldn't believe it could be that many but it is, it's 60,000 closed, gone. They're all coming back, they're all coming back. And right now, just in a very short period of time, we've added 12,000 brand new factories and many more are coming in. And one of the reasons they're coming in is we've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average American household $3000 a year and total income gains for median households will reach over, ready?
$10,000 a family, $10,000. Now, under the Bush administration, the $10,000 that includes what we've done in terms of median income, I'm adding in there the tax cuts, which are tremendous, $2,400 and I'm adding the regulation cuts, I'm adding the whole package over $10,000. Now, under President Bush, it was $450, under Barack-Hussein Obama, it was $975, under President Donald J. Trump, it's $10,000 in three years, right?
In three years, don't forget, President Bush, eight years, $450, President Obama, eight years, $975, President Trump, three years, not even, not even, not even, but three years, $10,000 and we're going up, we're going up.  We ended the last administration's war on American energy and we ended the war on clean, beautiful coal.
It's being shipped to Vietnam, it's being shipped all over the world. While every Democrat running for President wants to shut down our coal mines, we are putting our miners back to work. Indeed we must, indeed we must. Clean coal. What they do with coal today is incredible, clean coal. And with the help of energy workers right here in Ohio, the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far, No. 1. We weren't No. 1, every top Democrat candidate has pledged to eliminate American production of oil and natural gas.
How does that work by the way. How would you like to go into Texas and say, by the way, we don't want your oil or natural gas anymore? How about Bado? Remember he said I was born to be President.
Anybody that says that I said that's the end of his career. Remember, he had the cover of the magazine?  I won't mention the magazine, sleazebag magazine. He was born to be President and right after that he came tumbling down, but he's from Texas. So, he was against religion. He was against oil and he was against guns.
Abraham Lincoln could not win in Texas with that platform. That's not a good platform, it's not a good platform, but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry. And if you do that, you're got to shut down half your businesses. It's really more than that and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive.
So, we have all forms of energy. We have every form of energy and we are doing great, but they want to cripple your state's economy. But the voters of Ohio will never let that happen, never going to let it happen. And our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years, and sadly, I can't say historic because, you know, a couple of hundred years ago there was nobody here, right?
So, I assume that 200 or 300 years ago was cleaner, probably. You never know, but our water and our air is as clean as it's ever been, and I took us out of that horrible Paris accord. I always say, how are you doing with the Paris accord? Don't ask, saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us.  In my opinion, it was put in there to hurt us. We were paying money to India, we were paying money to China, China's didn't kick in until 2030, we kicked in immediately.
We had to pay money. Russia kicked in '20, let's say, they kicked in before. They were 19, wait, they were 1996. That was a very dirty period of air, so, they didn't have -- we kick in now and that -- it's just unacceptable. We would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars. We would have had to close up. I think, at least 25% to 30% of our businesses.
Who the hell would make a deal like that, right? Who would make a deal like that? No, I want fair. You look at Russia. You look at China. You look at India. They all got these massive breaks. We've got no breaks and we're paying money, and I say sometimes to France, how are the yellow vests working out? Because they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of. So, we are in good shape.
It took a certain amount of courage to do that. I said I'm going to get killed on this one, and you know what I did it, and I was applauded because the people get it. The people know what we're doing and they're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world. They're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world.
For decades, career politicians promise to defend the workers of Ohio, and then, they went to Washington and voted for the same globalist policies that devastated your communities and chipped away your jobs. You know that better than anybody, Ohio knows that. But the betrayal of Ohio workers and U.S. workers ended the day I took the oath of office and you see that because you set a record.
I immediately canceled the Obama administration's job-killing catastrophe, which would have dealt a death blow to the United States auto industry, the Transpacific Partnership. It was a disaster. That was going to be worse than NAFTA. NAFTA, I always say the world's worst deal. I think that would have been worse.
It would have taken the car industry. It would have taken many of your industries. That was a setup for the United States to get fleeced. The USMCA will save the American auto industry and create over 100,000 new auto jobs, and our factories will not be closing and moving to other faraway lands. We'll keep them right here.
That's over and that's going to include because we take care of our great auto workers of Toledo, the home of Jeep. How good is Jeep? And I've taken the toughest-ever action against China's chronic trade abuses, including tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese made goods, bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury.
And I gave some of that money because they were targeted to our farmers and our farmers did just fine.  And now, the deal is done and the other deals are done and the farmers are doing very well. We love our farmers and they never complain. They never complain. You know when they'd go, the fake news back then, when they'd go in there and talk to the farmers, what do you think of President Trump, China is deciding not to buy anymore?
He said you know what the farmers would say? We're going to have to suffer for a while because China and these other nations have been ripping us off for years. The President is right and we're with the President. How great are they? How great are they? But our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable Phase 1 trade deal with China, and again, we're keeping the tariffs on because we'll use that for another one.
We are taking billions -- remember what I said? We're not paying for it because China devalued their currency, and they put a lot of money into the pot. We're not paying for it. And now, they're starting to say, I guess he was right, and our trade deficit, as a result, has really come substantially down.
It was just in the papers today. The trade deficit has come down, as a result of our actions, steel mills all across Ohio. You know this better than I do are roaring back to life. JSW Steel is investing $500 million in Mingo Junction. Republic Steel is reopening the Lorain mill that they idled in 2016. Charter Steel is building a $150 million mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Nucor is investing $85 million at a facility in Marion, Ohio.
Think of that. Think of that. The steel industry was dead and now it's vibrant. All told, American steel companies are currently making $13 billion worth of new investments all across our nation. Think of that. They weren't investing $0.10. The industry was dead. Now, it's vibrant.  After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation.
We are finally putting America first. Think of it. From the day I came down that escalator, it started. Who the hell else could have taken this stuff, right?
Do I get some credit for that. Saying, mommy, mommy take me home. These are bad people. The Democrat politicians who are fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to Ohio jobs and factories. They destroyed your factories, they destroyed your jobs, but they're losing and we're winning, and America's comeback continues full speed ahead.
On no issue have Democrat politicians both thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of illegal immigration. Far-left radical politicians, support deadly sanctuary cities, demonstrating their contempt, scorn, and disdain for everyday Americans and the American family. These jurisdictions release dangerous, violent criminal aliens out of their jails, and directly onto your streets, where they are free to rob, attack, and kill American citizens, but we stop it. They want open borders.
Can you believe it? And because of Democrats open border policies -- they want open borders. They want people flowing. Come on in, come on in. As just one example right here in Ohio, you all know about it. An illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree, attempting to rape a 14-year old girl, then raping and murdering a 60-year old woman, then shooting another woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children, and finally, the police came.
We love our police and they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal. Thanks to Democrat policies, MS-13 gang members, they're the worst, were allowed to infiltrate the country. You know I call them animals and Nancy Pelosi said, they're not animals, they're human beings. Take a look at what's happening to her district.
Her district is one of the most disgusting, dirtiest. It used to be one of the best in the country. Now, it's a disgrace what's happened. Drug needles all over the place, the homeless that they're not taking care of, tents down, major thoroughfares? What happened to San Francisco, in particular, her district as she lives in this beautiful house?
But they terrorize our citizens, including killing their victims with machetes, MS-13. They kill them with machetes.  Do you know why? Because it's more painful than using a gun. Federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 20 vile MS-13 gang members in Central Ohio and they will be sent to jail, or frankly if they hold them.
I don't know that they hold them. They're going to be sent the hell back home. Last year alone, ICE officers, who by the way, are heroes. These are brave people. I don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. Let's see if you could do it? You could do it over there, you could do it. Mostly, you would not.
I mean, I've seen it. They have these people, they like are killers and our guys are here and they run and they call them nets, they have nets, and they run and they're swinging and punching. I say what the hell kind of a job is that? That's what they do. They're tough people, they're great patriots. Who the hell wants to do it? They're incredible, ICE, and they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 members every single year.
They throw them into the back of a van and we get them the hell out of our country. But ICE officers worked with Ohio police to remove 1,200 dangerous criminal aliens from your street, and you know all your streets? Do you see the difference now, between what it is now? Do we have a problem over there, go ahead?
Take your time. Take your time. Good.  Thank you, great job. Thank you. Don't forget, these people here, unlike you up there, these people have been waiting for three days. So, they're going to be -- I don't know. You know what? If I had to wait three days, I think I like your seat better, OK? I like your seat better.
But Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. That's really the way it is. We side with law enforcement, with law-abiding Americans, not law-breaking criminal aliens. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country. By the thousands, we are sending them home and we will not let them back in, and I have to tell you, a lot of things are happening.
You're going to hear about them in two seconds. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since May. We have ended catch and release. Catch and release, do you know what catch and release is? We catch them, we take down their name, and then, we release them. What kind of crap is that?
These are the policies that we inherited. You catch somebody, you take their name and say, please come back in three years, right? And we release them into our country, and if you don't do that everybody get sued. Can you believe this? We have ended catch and release. The other one, beauty.  How about the lottery?
It's called visa lottery. How about this? They put their hand, these people are going to America, bomb -- and I will not use names because I'll be accused of something. But from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador. Only in Ohio could that happen. Who's the man that did that boo?
Who is that? So anyway, but in Honduras and Guatemala, they have like this lottery. Now, the people, I've gotten to know the government officials, they're good. We made some good things. They agreed to take our people back. You know their people back, they wouldn't take them back. You know they'd send them here, they go into our country, we'd bring them back, under past administrations, and then after that, they'd say we're not taking them back.
We're not taking them back. Take them back. Take them the hell out of here. We're not letting you land your plane. So, we have a government flying a plane over trying to get a couple of prisoners, bad people back. Now, they take them back. Do you know why? Because I said look, if you don't take them back, we're going to put tariffs on every single thing that you're selling.
Now they say, we would love to take them back. We would love to take them back we'll. Take them back gladly, sir.  No, they couldn't take them back. We would take over these absolute thugs, these gang members, we would bring them back, and they wouldn't accept them. We couldn't land the plane. We couldn't get anything through the border.
It comes through the border this way, but not that way, but now, they take them back. They've been great, actually. They've been really good. Now, we're paying them a lot of money. We're paying them $500 million a year. Can you believe we paid them $500 million, the three of them, El Salvador, included? And I said look, we're not going to pay any money anymore because you're not treating us right and they've been great.
They've been great. They take them back. How many would you like us to take? We'll take as many as you want and here's the big thing, ready? You read it today in the newspapers. In the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, we won the big, big, beautiful lawsuit, where they were all suing us. The wall is being built.
We built, we built already a tremendous amount, but we're releasing $4 billion of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall. It's literally being signed now. It'll be under construction very shortly, in a couple of weeks, and we've already built over 100 miles of wall. How about that hundred miles?
And by the end of next year, we're going to have a lot of the wall built, and it's already having a big impact. How about the Democrats?  Walls don't work, we want technology. So, what are you going to do? They want drones. Oh good, when people are rushing the caravans, when they're rushing, having a drone flying around that's not going to help you too much, OK? Nothing like this -- well, you know, five years ago, the Democrats all wanted the wall.
They just could never get it built. They didn't know how to help to build it. I do. So, we built a 100 miles. I think, probably more than that now. We have a lot under contract, but we won our big case. Just -- I woke up, they said, sir, we have good news. They overturned a horrible decision from the lower court.
You can now fund the rest of the wall. I said thank you very much, thank you. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, but they want to have open borders. They want to have sanctuary cities.  The radical Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. They are stone, cold, crazy. You know it's interesting, as I'm saying this stuff, you know, they want crime, they want chaos, I'm saying all this stuff, and then, I say gee, now I sort of understand why they hate me. But it's true, it's true.
Their policies are a disaster. They're bad politicians and they have horrible policies, but what they do, they stick together and they're vicious. They're vicious, horrible people. I didn't use to say that. They are horrible people. What they do to people is a disgrace, but they stick together. Now, the Republicans, thank you very much.
The Republicans, my man, the Republicans, we were 196 to nothing in the House, and I have a feeling the Senate is going to be great also, 196 to nothing, and we took in three Democrats. And Congressman Van Drew left their party and joined our party. So, we've done things that nobody's ever done before, but the Democrats are taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders and that group.
. Isn't she a nice woman, Tlaib.  What a group but they're the leaders of the party. They're really, in my opinion, the least. That's what happened. That's how they got into this impeachment hoax. All of you.
You, you're the leader of your party. But the Democrats are pushing the socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans of their private insurance plans and massively raise taxes on the middle class. A lot of you have private insurance plans that you love. They're going to take them away from you.
But see, I don't like doing this too soon. I did it with Pocahontas. I came up with this great name. I came up with a lot of different stuff. I said she was a total fraud and everybody believed me, and she went down. Then she started coming up, then she went down. It doesn't help me to do it a year and a half before the election.
That's why like with the Green New Deal, OK? I want to say great things about it, OK? I don't want to knock it, and then they say, we're not going to use that. I like it when they say, no longer can you fly airplanes. No longer can you have any cows in the pasture, right? No longer can we do anything, we can't do anything anymore.
No, the Green New Deal. I love it. I think it's great, it should be debated, it should be debated. So, what we're going to do very seriously. We're going to not talk badly about them. We're going to say the Green -- they asked me about it. The other day, gentlemen, just ask me about it backstage. I said no, it's something that has to be considered.
And then, about two weeks before the election, I'll let you know the facts because this doesn't matter. We're too far ahead of the election. The Green New Deal. That's a beauty. You know it's amazing though. I see this Congressman that's been there. He has white hair, beautiful white hair.  No, it's not you and he's with AOC, and he's saying, yes, we have to go with the Green New Deal.
And I'm saying is this guy for real? I don't know if he believes that he's been around for 20 years in Congress? I've seen him. I know him a little bit and he's acting like he actually believes it. But we're going to just take our time and we're going to relax and about three, four -- you're going to join some rallies about a month before, you're going to hear the real facts, but I'm tired of talking them out of things ten months before the election.
Bernie Sanders' healthcare plan would cost over $32 trillion a year. That's more money than we make in five years, that's more money than we'll ever make. He is indeed crazy. No, no, please. Now let me take that back. No, it's a great plan that we have to consider strong. We have to consider his plan strongly.
Now see, I'll tell you what the fake news will do. They'll take my last words. It's a great plan. We have to consider it strongly. They'll cut everything out in the front and they'll say, Donald Trump, is in favor of Bernie Sanders' Green New Deal.
No, they'll do that. You'll see it somewhere. You'll see it, Trump supports his plan. They are sick.  Republicans will defend middle-class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice. We will protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will protect you a pre-existing physician. You'll have your physician.
Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth.
Radical Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the party of the American dream. We still have that American dream. As of today, we've appointed 187 Federal Judges to interpret the Constitution as written.
Think of that and two great Supreme Court judges. Think of that 187 seven Federal and Court of Appeals judges. Think of that. Thank you, President Obama. He gave us 142 Judges. Thank you. Thank you very much, President Obama. We have a record. It's a record and we will appoint many more, but we -- first day I had 142 Judges, 142. I said how many do we have?
Sir, you have 142. I said you got to be kidding. I thought he'd say, maybe, none, maybe one, but certainly, no more than one. They're like gold.  They said no, sir, you have 142. I said you've got to be kidding. How did this happen? President Obama, President Obama did not get that done. And by the way, Mitch helped a lot too.
I have to tell you. Mitch helped a lot. He helped a lot. It wasn't so easy, Mitch McConnell. We're aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and it's bad. In 2018, drug overdose deaths in Ohio fell by, listen to this, 22%. It's not good enough, but 22% opioid. And as we continue rebuilding our military, we have restarted the legendary army tank factory in Lima, and we've authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new Abrams tanks to be built In the Buckeye State, that's a lot of -- thank you.
So wait, just a quick one, OK. I'm proud of this. So, they have this Army tank plant right, in Lima, and I said, what's going on? They're closing it. I said oh, they are? Well, you know, -- they're closing everything. When I came in they want to close everything. So, I was President-elect. I think, right around that time and I went to Lima.
I went through the factory where they make these trucks, the plant, and they make the tanks and they make all of these armored vehicles, and I said these people are amazing. You could never close this. You could never reopen it again. They'd been doing this for many, many decades, and this factory was incredible, and I looked at the tanks they were making, they're the best in the world, right?
The Abrams, they're the best in the world. I said wait a minute if you close this, we're not going to be able -- where are you going to build tanks? This is the primary factory in the whole country. I think it might be the only factory in the whole country.  So, they're going to close it. What are we going to do, send over to China for tanks?
Please send us. Please send us 200 tanks. We don't want to send you any tanks because we're going to kick your ass. No, no, we've got to make our own tanks, right? We've got to make our own tanks. So, I did something based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else. Based on my instinct, I said you can't close this plant.
I went through that plant. I spent two, three hours talking to the people that worked there. I looked at some of that hydraulic and I'm -- I love the whole thing, the world of tractors and all of that stuff. I know a lot about it and I looked at the carvings. I looked at the metal, I looked at how perfect everything was, the turrets, the round, how perfect it fit they put it on.  It would fit like within one, 100th of an inch, and I said, you're not going to be able to do this anyplace else.
I said and we're going to be expanding our military. We're going to be rebuilding. Who the hell is going to make our tanks if you close it? I said keep it open. I actually -- it was all closed. Does every -- anybody from Lima? Is that the truth there? Right, right? It was closed, they announced it was closed.
It was all set to close. I said you can't close this plant. And now look at the numbers I just gave you, we're making almost 500 tanks. You could have never reopened a place like that. It's incredible and you could have never gotten those workers. They are really skilled people. And if you did, it would have cost you billions and billions of dollars to do, and it wouldn't have been as good as what you have.
So, that was something I did that I'm very proud of because I really overrode a lot of talented people that wanted to close it. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and we further recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 52 years. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America.
Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Ohio. Great. At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, and fought so hard to secure, then, we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. We have to win.
You know, we have to win because all of these things that we've done can be undone, and you can have a country that goes to hell very, very fast, very, very fast. Only this way can we save the America that we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all, and I have seen that dirty, rotten swamp better than anybody else in America, a lot of crooked people.
Disgusting, crooked people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA.
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Nobody knew that.  It could have been done long before I got here. They had the technology, but we're ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Isn't that amazing?
Who would've thought that's possible? Who would have thought that's possible? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one big beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.
And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of generations of Ohio patriots, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation.  From Cleveland to Cincinnati, from Dublin to Dayton, and from Columbus to Toledo, this state is the home of proud families and farmers and miners and manufacturers and aviators and astronauts.
Ohio is where the Wright brothers invented the airplane and where Annie Oakley got her gun. Ohio is the state that gave us American legends and American heroes like Thomas Edison, Neil Armstrong, and the great John Glenn. Ohio is the place where strong American workers, mine coal, work the railroads and forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater than ever before.
Proud citizens, like you, helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people.  With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Ohio, the best is yet to come. Because together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Toledo. Thank you.

Franklin Pierce,"To the Senate of the United States:
I hasten to respond briefly to the resolution of the Senate of this date, ""requesting the President to inform the Senate, if in his opinion it be not incompatible with the public interest, whether anything has arisen since the date of his message to the House of Representatives of the 15th of March last concerning our relations with the Government of Spain which in his opinion may dispense with the suggestions therein contained touching the propriety of provisional measures' by Congress to meet any exigency that may arise in the recess of Congress affecting those relations.""
In the message to the House of Representatives referred to I availed myself of the occasion to present the following reflections and suggestions:
In view of the position of the island of Cuba, its proximity to our coast, the relations which it must ever bear to our commercial and other interests, it is vain to expect that a series of unfriendly acts infringing our commercial rights and the adoption of a policy threatening the honor and security of these States can long consist with peaceful relations.
In case the measures taken for amicable adjustment of our difficulties with Spain should, unfortunately, fail, I shall not hesitate to use the authority and means which Congress may grant to insure the observance of our just rights, to obtain redress for injuries received, and to vindicate the honor of our flag.
In anticipation of that contingency, which I earnestly hope may not arise, I suggest to Congress the propriety of adopting such provisional measures as the exigency may seem to demand.
The two Houses of Congress may have anticipated that the hope then expressed would be realized before the period of its adjournment, and that our relations with Spain would have assumed a satisfactory condition, so as to remove past causes of complaint and afford better security for tranquillity and justice in the future. But I am constrained to say that such is not the fact. The formal demand for immediate reparation in the case of the Black Warrior , instead of having been met on the part of Spain by prompt satisfaction, has only served to call forth a justification of the local authorities of Cuba, and thus to transfer the responsibility for their acts to the Spanish Government itself.
Meanwhile information, not only reliable in its nature, but of an official character, was received to the effect that preparation was making within the limits of the United States by private individuals under military organization for a descent upon the island of Cuba with a view to wrest that colony from the dominion of Spain. International comity, the obligations of treaties, and the express provisions of law alike required, in my judgment, that all the constitutional power of the Executive should be exerted to prevent the consummation of such a violation of positive law and of that good faith on which mainly the amicable relations of neighboring nations must depend. In conformity with these convictions of public duty, a proclamation was issued to warn all persons not to participate in the contemplated enterprise and to invoke the interposition in this behalf of the proper officers of the Government. No provocation whatever can justify private expeditions of hostility against a country at peace with the United States. The power to declare war is vested by the Constitution in Congress, and the experience of our past history leaves no room to doubt that the wisdom of this arrangement of constitutional power will continue to be verified whenever the national interest and honor shall demand a resort to ultimate measures of redress. Pending negotiations by the Executive, and before the action of Congress, individuals could not be permitted to embarrass the operations of the one and usurp the powers of the other of these depositaries of the functions of Government.
I have only to add that nothing has arisen since the date of my former message to ""dispense with the suggestions therein contained touching the propriety of provisional measures by Congress.""
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Appreciate it. We had some crowd coming in. I don't know, you have a lot of people up here. A lot more than people think. And they're great people, and they like Trump -- that, I can tell you.
. We got off Air Force One, and we came, and the roads were packed. Five deep; ten deep, in some cases. I have to be very careful because I have the fake news back. They'll say, ""It was only two deep."" And they'll end up putting me on the front page.
But we had some fantastic crowd, and I just want to thank you all. You're very special people. And this is a great plant, and it's doing a phenomenal job. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
I also want to thank Scott. I'm thrilled to be back in the magnificent state of Maine. As you know, you treated me very nicely in the last election, 2016. You treated me very nicely. I needed the one point. Now I'd like to win the whole state. Could you mind, please? Okay.
Maine and Nebraska -- they cut them in half and they say, one way or the other -- I don't know, you have the double. That's okay. But this one we had tremendous, tremendous turnout, and we did very well in both parts, actually. But it's a great state. And we just solved a big lobster, fishermen problem. We gave 5,000 acres of water, and we gave you your rights back.
So with a stroke of the pen, your fishermen like me maybe even more than you like me. Okay? It could be -- could be. But it was a great thing.
But I just want to say hello to the hardworking men and women of Puritan Medical Products. Great company. The incredible workers of this company have carried on the noble tradition of American manufacturing excellence for more than 100 years. Now our nation has turned to you as we massively increase our unrivaled testing capacity.
We're at -- as an example, 20 million tests. Germany is at 4 million. South Korea, which you heard so much about -- they're doing a good job -- they're at about 3 million. We're well over 20 million. Very shortly, we'll be well over 20 million tests.
Remember this: When you have more tests, you have more cases. I say to my people: Every time we test, you find cases because we do more testing. So if we have more cases -- if we wanted to do testing in China or in India, or other places, I promise you, there'd be more cases.
But we're doing a great job with the testing. And you're doing a fantastic job in getting out the swabs.
On behalf of the entire nation, I want to thank you. You're building a big addition right alongside. You know that. So you're going to have a lot more jobs coming here in a very short period of time.
Puritan is one of the only manufacturers in the world producing the high-quality medical swabs that are crucial for the rapid testing, and every swab you make at Puritan is proudly stamped with a beautiful phrase, ""Made in the USA."" Do you like that phrase.
Thanks to the testing capacity that you're making possible, our country is reopening and our economy is recovering like nobody would have thought possible. I guess you all saw the news today, right? It was unbelievable.
Earlier today, it was announced that the U.S. economy added 2.5 million jobs in May. It was supposed to lose 9 million, you know, during this period -- transition period. I call it ""transition to greatness,"" but it's coming a little earlier than I thought, and that's okay. I don't like to be wrong on the other side, but earlier is okay. But it was supposed to be 9 million.
If you watch -- I don't know if anybody watches the business shows, but I'm watching this morning, and they thought it was a typographical error because it was supposed to be nine. And before the show -- or during the show, they're predicting. It comes out, the job numbers -- the very famous job numbers -- and it comes out, and -- 8:30 in the morning, and I'm looking forward to seeing what's going on. And turn it on, and they're predicting: ""No, I think it's going to be more than 9 million jobs lost,"" during the period prior to going back up. And another one said, ""No, 8.5. No, 11. No, 10."" You know, all geniuses.
And now it's 8:30, you hear a bell go off, and the woman gets it, in this case, and she's going, ""Well, it's only 3 million jobs lost."" And then a couple of seconds later, she goes, ""Wait a minute, this isn't jobs lost; this is jobs gained."" And it's almost 3 million jobs gained. And she thought she had a typographical error, and what happened was incredible. I mean -- and the market went through; it finished very, very high -- almost, I guess, around 900 points up.
And our stock market is booming, and our jobs are booming. And, you know, you just have to look at a place like this. You just have to get off the plane and ride here, and you see the spirit of Maine and other places -- other places. It's amazing.
So we absolutely shattered expectations. And this is the largest monthly jobs increase in American history. American -- think of that: That's a long time, right? By far. I think it's more than double or about double of what our highest was before.
So this is the largest monthly job increase in American history. How about that? And we're going to have a phenomenal next year. We're going to have a tremendous couple of months prior to the election, on November 3rd. A very, very important day. It's going to be a very important election because the only thing that can screw it up is if you get the wrong President and they raise your taxes, and they open up your border so that everybody pours into our country.
COVID or non-COVID -- you used to never hear of COVID, but now we have COVID to add to the list of other things. So, we have a wall that's over 210 miles long already going up. And we'll be finishing it off very early next year with 500 miles of wall in the most treacherous places. And it's been an amazing thing. We have -- we're setting records on our border right now for -- for holding people out. We don't want people coming in. We want people coming in through a legal process and through merit -- and that's what we're doing -- where they can help our country.
But economists forecast that the unemployment rate, as I said, would be about 19 percent, and they were hoping for 20 percent, the opponents of ours. They'd rather have things be bad so they can try and win an election. So they were hoping it would be 20 percent. Instead, it's 13 percent. That was good. That -- we made up a lot of time, a lot of distance. It's really great. This was better than I thought. I thought it would be okay, but I didn't know this. It means you were much ahead of schedule. And don't forget, that doesn't include New York, New Jersey, and many other states -- and, by the way, your state. When are you going to open the state up.
No, seriously, you're going to miss your whole -- you know, you do 40 million people in tourism, and you have a governor that won't let you open up. What's she doing? What's she doing? I don't know that much; I just know you're great people.
You know what I know about Maine? I know you're great people. But you have -- this is like -- you know, they say December, for Tiffany's, that's their big month, right? This is your time. This is your big month. This is your Christmas, in terms of tourism, your dollars, when you -- how can you be closed? I mean -- and I see it all the time. Everybody wants to have Maine open, so I figured I might as well say it while I'm up here. You ought to get the state open, Governor.
Got a lot of -- you have a lot of angry people in Maine about that. I mean, they think -- I say, ""What are you doing? That's a strange one."" Some, I understand a little bit more, but this one is not one that should be closed. You're missing a lot of money and a lot of everything and a lot of people and a lot of spirit. Get it open.
We added 1.2 million leisure and hospitality jobs; 464,000 construction jobs; 424,000 education and healthcare jobs; 368,000 retail jobs. And listen to this one: Remember, the previous administration said, ""Oh, there'll not be any more manufacturing jobs in our country."" I say, ""Excuse me?"" Two hundred and twenty-five thousand manufacturing jobs, and that's during a pandemic.
And we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. You know, we had a -- an economy, the likes of which we've never had. We had almost 160 million, which was the highest number we've ever had, by far. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American -- the greatest employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had.
Greatest stock market numbers. And we're very close to those numbers, which is pretty amazing.
. Look, it's bad things. The only way you're going to end it is stupid policy, because I built it once, now I'm building it again. We had to close it down. We did the right thing. We closed it down and we saved millions of lives.
But now we opened it up, and it's opening up to a bang. We're going to have better -- this next year will be better, I think, than any year we're ever had. That's how I feel about it. And I've been saying it for a long time. The year coming up.
America's economic comeback has begun. The next year is set to be a year, and -- I remember I said it, but it's going to be an amazing year. For you, it's going to be great. Your new site is going to be open. It's a big area that you're building, and your expansion at Puritan.
. We have -- these are tremendous people. These are great -- really, loving people. They're doing something very important. When you think about what they're doing, their product is superior. It's terrific. And it's made in the USA, and that's -- I shouldn't tell you this, but I use it every other day. I say, ""Is that a Puritan, please.
But we're also joined by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, who's doing a great job. Thank you, Alex. Peter -- stand on up, Peter.
Mr. Congressman, would you please stand up? Come on. We did a thing. One of the most important things, Right to Try. Do you know what Right to Try is? That's where we have the most advanced medical people in the world -- labs and everything else -- and labs, in many cases, that you work with.
And we have a case where somebody was very sick and they'd go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world looking for a cure. You know, they were terminally ill or very sick, very ill. If they didn't have the money, they'd go home and die. They'd go home. But we have tremendous things coming along, and yet you have to go through a process of testing.
And I said, when we have a situation where somebody is terminally ill, or in that category, we want a right to try our labs. They shouldn't have to go to Europe and Asia. They shouldn't have to go all over the world to look for a cure. And we call it the ""Right to Try."" You have a right -- and it was complex because the drug companies didn't want it because of liability. The country didn't want it because they didn't want to get sued. The insurance companies didn't want it. The labs didn't want it because they didn't want to have anything bad happen to them in terms of what they had to put on -- so, you know, on their -- on their schedule.
So we said Right to Try. So they have the right to try. They sign a document. They waive the liability. The results -- I don't know if you know, but the results have been unbelievable. The results have been absolutely unbelievable. I mean, we've had some great things. One of the many things we've done. But every person here today is playing a vital role in the greatest national industrial mobilization since World War Two. We've marshaled the full power of the U.S. government and U.S. industry to defeat the invisible enemy.
And it is indeed an enemy. Should have been stopped in China. Came from China; should have been stopped in China. They didn't do that.
We've delivered over 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment to doctors and nurses on the frontlines. We slashed through red tape to speed the development of vaccines. And vaccines are coming along incredibly well. Wait until you see them. Therapeutics.
And we partnered with private-sector leaders, such as Puritan, to build the largest and most advanced testing capacity on the face of the Earth, like this one.
At this single factory, you quickly ramped up production to produce nearly 20 million foam-tip swabs each month. Then, in April, my administration invoked the Defense Production Act to help you scale up even more. Under a 75-million-dollar public-private partnership, Puritan will soon double production to 40 million swabs per month. That's a lot. That's a lot. That's why we're beating the world.
And ultimately, you'll triple production to an astounding 60 million swabs a month, an amazing achievement of American industrial strength. To accomplish this tremendous increase, you partnered with another legendary Maine institution. You've never heard of this, I'm sure: Bath Iron Works. Right. They do a great job.
Under the Defense Production Act, Bath Iron Works is now producing the complex machinery you need to manufacture tens of millions more swabs. And we're all profoundly grateful to the amazing workers at Bath Shipyard and the executives. They're really working very closely in many ways, including the building of ships.
Here at Puritan, you've already hired 200 new employees with full benefits. And when your new 95,000-square-foot factory in Pittsfield comes online, Puritan will hire an additional 150 Maine workers. Made in the USA, right?
Powered by the dedication of the men and women in this room, America has become the world leader in coronavirus testing. The United States has completed more than 19 million tests, the most anywhere in the world, by far, as I said. You're now over 20 -- 21, almost.
Thanks to you, our country has conducted more tests than all other countries in the world combined. Other than that, you're not doing very well.
No, if you listen to the fake news, it's like, well -- you know, I give them a number: ""We did 20 million."" ""Why didn't you do 40."" If we did 40, they'd say, ""Should have done 100."" Ay-ya-yay, what I have to put up with.
And, you know, when we took over, the cupboards were empty. I always say ""the cupboards,"" meaning the stockpile. We had very little. And we became now the king of ventilators, also. We'll have to talk to Puritan. You want to make some ventilators. We're making thousands a week. We have 11 factories, plants. We had practically none, and we saved thousands and thousands of lives.
Ventilators are very hard because they're big, they're expensive. I say it's like making a car, in a certain way. High technology, right? And we're now making thousands of ventilators a week. And we are at a point where we're actually helping other countries. We're sending ventilators to other countries -- Nigeria, 200 ventilators. And then they called and we sent them eight hun- -- we have a thousand going to Nigeria. Italy, France, Spain. Many, many countries. Russia -- we're sending some to Russia. It's good for relationship. It's good for everything.
And we're knocking them out, and, you know, people aren't able to just -- you can do a swab, even though it's not that easy, but a ventilator takes a long time. It's the greatest mobilization, as I said. I mean, greatest since World War Two. It's been really amazing.
And I'd love the people of the administration, but I'd also like to have our people that work on it, even our -- the people of our country to get credit for these things. You know, we got geared up; we did so well. Then you heard about ventilators. There hasn't been one person in the entire country, from the beginning of this horrible plague that came in -- the plague; it's what it is. There hasn't been one person that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. And we started off from a very low platform. They needed, desperately, thousands and thousands of ventilators.
But when you think of it, not one person -- with all of the size of our country and all of the people that were sick -- not one person, not one that needed a ventilator didn't get it. I think it's an incredible achievement to Mike Pence, to all of the people that work in the administration, and to all of the people that went and worked so hard to produce them.
And the testing, the same thing. We get -- whether it's Abbott Laboratories or any of the many plans -- Roche -- we have this incredible testing capacity. We started off with zilch, nothing.
So they've done a fantastic job. The whole team has done a really great job, Peter. Wouldn't you say? Been very amazing.
I want to take a moment to recognize just a few of the hardworking patriots -- and that's what they are -- of Maine, who were instrumental in this colossal effort that you've done at Puritan.
Angie Buscher. Where is Angie? Come on, Angie. Come on up here. She's highly respected. I think she's very good. Maybe I should hire her. Let's bring her back.
Please, say a few words. Please.
Thank you, Angie. Appreciate it. Let's -- let's take a picture. Come on. Get over here, Angie. Thank you, darling. I'm not supposed to do that, but it's okay. What can I -- what am I going to do? Say, ""Angie -- don't do that, Angie"". Great job, Angie.
We're also joined by Tracy Porter. Tracy, come on up and say a few words, please. Tracy. Looks too young to say 40 years, I can tell you. Fantastic, Tracy.
Forty years?
Okay.
I feel better. I'm looking at you, I say, ""How is that 40 years?""
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. He's -- even 31 years, he's -- good head of hair he's got, too. Keep looking good. Keep looking good. Keep healthy, everybody in here. Keep healthy.
With us as well is Derek McKenney, the senior manufacturing engineer at Puritan and a project manager for the new manufacturing plant -- which is a big deal -- coming on line. Derek, please come up and say a few words.
Hi, Derek. Thank you very much.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's really your mother?
Good genes.
Come on, get over here. Let's take a picture. Get over here. Come on. Come on. Come on, mom. Come on, mom, get in here.
Beautiful. Did he do a good job, mom?
I think he did. He'll be running for office next year. Watch. Appreciate it. Great job.
And thank you all. The remarkable testing capacity that each of you has made possible, it's not only helping our nation to defeat the virus -- that horrible, horrible, terrible, disgusting, angry virus -- it's paving the way to get America safely and responsibly back open for business, and that's what we're doing right now. We're doing it right now. It's happening very quickly, a lot quicker than people thought.
Our strategy for a phased and gradual reopening protects our most vulnerable citizens -- and you know who they are; we've learned a lot about that -- especially in the nursing homes, while allowing younger and healthier Americans to get safely back to work and go to school. I think, in the fall, you're going to see the schools all open and in great shape.
The best approach to protect the health of our citizens is to focus our resources on safeguarding those at highest risk, while allowing those at lowest risk to go and resume economic activity, including education.
A key element of our effort to reopen, revitalize, and rebuild America greater than ever is bringing critical industries back to our shores.
As the workers of Maine know well -- and that's for many decades -- Washington politicians shipped away your jobs, outsourced to your supply chains, and offshored your industry. It's probably the number-one reason I'm here today, although I was going to say another politician -- probably, they wouldn't be here. They wouldn't bother with it. To me, it's very important. I had to save your fishing industry. It was so easy -- so easy to do, if you want to do it.
But we -- we really talked about this for a long time. Our companies would leave us. They'd fire everybody, pay no taxes. They'd go to another country. They'd make the product. They would sell it into our country with no tax, no nothing -- while we ended up with no jobs, empty buildings, empty factories. You had them in Maine all over the place.
But we're changing all of that. We've made tremendous trade deals now. Tremendous trade deals. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal is an incredible deal. Incredible deal for our country. And many other deals. We just signed a deal with China, but unfortunately, in that case, the ink wasn't even dry, and all of the sudden, the plague came in -- and so I view it a little bit differently, perhaps.
But they've been living up to the deal. They're buying a lot of -- a lot of things. They never had any deal. They just came in and took advantage of the United States. Took out hundreds of billions of dollars a year. So they don't do that anymore, but it's a terrible thing that happened.
But as the global pandemic has shown, once and for all, the United States must produce essential equipment, supplies, pharmaceuticals, and technologies for ourselves. And we cannot rely on China and all of these other countries that, in bad times, take advantage of us and rip us off. We don't do that anymore. We're moving things back into our country.
That's why the United States is now engaged in a great national effort to bring industries, factories, and jobs back to America where they belong. We want them back here. Just like you're doing it, we have other -- other places all over the country. Of course, they're not as good as Puritan, but they're pretty good.
And I'm committed to ensuring that our country will be the world's premier pharmacy. It's going to be a pharmacy, drugstore, and medical manufacturer. We don't make our medical products here. We don't make our drugs here that we need -- our desperately needed prescription drugs or otherwise.
In my administration, we live by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.
So, just in ending -- I mean, I say: For centuries, the people of this great state have fished the oceans and farmed the fields and worked the factories that have supplied and sustained our nation. And then they went through a very bad time -- a very bad time. Right here in Guilford, generations of proud Maine patriots have poured out their heart, sweat, and soul for this country, making the critical products produced by Puritan. And now Puritan is doing better than it's ever done, I guess, by a factor of a lot, right? Right?
You know, they call themselves ""associates."" See, in the old days, they'd say they were the boss. They're very smart. I say, ""Oh, that's very smart."" But they've done a great job as associates. You're all associates.
Each of you now carries on this extraordinary legacy and exceptional heritage, serving our nation at this very historic time. This is a historic time. This is a very important time for our country. You see what's going on. But a lot of good things are going on. A lot of things are going on. A very big thing happened, though, today, when we saw numbers the likes of which we've never seen in the history of our country. Good timing. Because people look at that, and they say, ""Hey, this country is great. We've done things that nobody else has ever done."" It was good to -- good that they see that, right? Good timing.
You and your families are making momentous contributions to the vitality of our country, helping us reopen, rebuild, and most importantly, saving lives. The workers of Maine have always been loyal to America. And while I'm your President, this government will always be loyal to you.
Just ask your fishing industry, ""How's Trump doing?"" Because they can't even believe what happened today. They just wrote it off -- President Obama. He signed. You couldn't use it anymore. They took it away. I gave it back.
By the way, I said, ""Why'd they take it away?"" Nobody knew. You know, it's okay to take it away if it means something. I mean -- but nobody knew.
With your help, we will vanquish the virus, we will get our nation back to work, and we shall build our glorious future with American hands, American grit, and American pride. And I want to just thank all of you for being here. You're very special people. This is a very special place. And it's a great state. And thank you very much.
And get that other half, by the way -- get that other half to go with Trump, okay. And I think they'll be there, too. Because there's a very, very important election coming up -- the most important. It's amazing what's happened, and you've been a big part of it. Thank you very much. Congratulations to everybody. Thank you.

Britain should be a beacon of quality, high standards, ethical treatment of animals and environmental protections in all aspects of food production.”
Conservative MPs have until now voted down Labour’s attempts to use the Agriculture Bill or the Trade Bill to enshrine in law the UK’s high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards. The next opportunity for change will come when the Agriculture Bill returns to the Commons next week.
Labour also wants the new Trade and Agriculture Commission – set up in the wake of the NFU’s million-strong petition – to have the teeth to assess each trade deal against core standards and ensure proper Parliamentary oversight, as called for in the Government’s own National Food Strategy.

David Cameron,"Good afternoon,
This European Council has rightly been focused on the migration crisis affecting continental Europe.
With over 8,000 migrants still arriving in Greece every week and signs that the numbers using the Central Mediterranean route are on the rise once again, it is absolutely vital that Europe takes the concrete action necessary to stem these flows.
And that is what we’ve agreed here today.
This is a plan to break the link between getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe. It’s a plan to bust the business model of the smugglers. And it’s a plan to reduce the numbers coming from both Turkey and Libya.
Let me say a few words on each.
First, I welcome the agreement we have reached with Turkey today.
We will work together to stop migrants from leaving Turkey in the first place, to stop at sea those that do leave and to turn back the boats and to return back to Turkey those that do make it to Greece.
For the first time in this crisis, I believe that we have a plan, if properly and fully implemented, that really could help to make a difference deterring people from coming and shutting down the trade that the smuggling gangs have been exploiting.
Now we’ve got this on paper, we have absolutely got to make it work in practice.
This will not be easy.
It will require a comprehensive and large scale operation.
Britain will help. We have the expertise. We have skilled officials. Indeed, we are already playing our part.
Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Mounts Bay and border force vessels are patrolling the Aegean.
Asylum experts and interpreters are already working in Greece to help them process individual cases.
And today I’ve said that we stand ready to do more.
But it all needs to be part of a fully worked up plan to be drawn up – at our suggestion – in the next few days.
Now let me be clear about the part the UK plays in this because of our special status.
We will not be giving visa free access for Turks coming to the UK. That is a decision taken by Schengen countries for the Schengen area. We are not in the Schengen area, we are not bound by their decisions. This is a national decision by Britain and we won’t be giving that visa free access.
Second, we will not be taking more refugees – we have our programme of resettling people direct from the refugee camps and that stays the same.
We are already investing in the Syrian refugee camps in Turkey and elsewhere and we have been calling for others to do more – so the financial commitment agreed today is money rightly spent and our share comes from our existing aid budget.
With this new agreement today, I do think we can significantly reduce numbers coming to Europe via the eastern Mediterranean.
But we mustn’t take our eye off the ball and forget about other routes – particularly across the central Mediterranean from North Africa.
Now the EU naval operation we established last Summer has had some success – over 90 vessels have been destroyed and more than 50 smugglers arrested.
HMS Enterprise is taking part and we will extend her deployment through the Summer.
But with a new government now in Libya, we now have an opportunity to make this operation more effective – working with the Libyan coastguard in Libyan waters so we can turn back the boats and stop the smugglers there too.
Now this isn’t going to happen overnight – but we need to start now.
That’s why today I brought together leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Malta to discuss how we make this happen.
And we all agreed that we would work with the new Libyan government, that we’d commit the necessary resources and we’d look towards the next stage of the mission which is going into Libyan territorial waters.
And we all agreed that we would:
– work with the new Libyan government
– we’d commit the necessary resources
– and we’d look toward the next stage of the mission which is going into Libyan territorial waters.
Finally, I just wanted to seize the opportunity here at this summit to address a concern of many people back at home – the VAT rate on sanitary products.
We have some EU wide VAT rules in order to make the single market work.
But on the specific issue of VAT on sanitary products, we have been pressing the European Commission for several months to bring forward proposals so we can apply a zero rate.
I secured clear Council Conclusions for this and that’s exactly what they will do – with proposals in the coming days.
What’s more, I also secured backing from all other European leaders for this plan.
So we are now a step closer to stopping this tampon tax once and for all.
It shows that when we fight for our interests here, we are heard and we can get things done.
We can reform the EU to make it work for Britain.
And at this summit we have shown that once again.
And I believe that Britain will be stronger, safer and better off in a reformed European Union.
Thank you very much.

Sarah Owen,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I want to start by paying tribute to my hon. Her bravery on this issue has been nothing short of inspirational, as she has put words to feelings that many are unable to. Hers and others’ experiences demonstrate why the Bill is so desperately needed.
As we have heard, the recent findings of the Home Affairs Committee make for devastating reading, with domestic abuse killings doubled and national abuse ​helplines seeing a 49% increase in calls. It was a horrific consequence of lockdown, which would come as no surprise to anyone who experiences domestic abuse. It is becoming apparent during this pandemic that people from black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds are disproportionately affected.
Domestic abuse affects all genders, races and sexualities, but BAME communities are likely to face additional barriers in accessing the services and help that they need, even outside a lockdown, so my concern is heightened at this difficult time. Although the statutory duty to support all those in refuges and supported accommodation is welcome, I echo Barnardo’s/Ipsos MORI in saying that victims, especially those who are BAME or have disabilities, are unlikely to be in that type of accommodation. For wonderfully diverse areas such as my constituency of Luton North, it would be helpful to have a comprehensive strategy that addresses domestic violence in BAME communities, especially regarding violence against migrant women.
The Bill needs to look beyond lockdown, which is why I want to speak about provision for protections in the world of work. This is where I declare an interest as a proud member and former employee of the GMB trade union.
Domestic abuse does not start and end once someone closes the door to their home. It haunts every part of your life, including work—the incessant phone calls; the texts; the emails; being stalked; the questioning why you are late, leaving work early or having to take days off sick. The anticipation of what awaits you after work fills you with an increasing sense of dread as the clock ticks closer to the end of the working day. Justifying every minute away from an abuser while trying to maintain a presence at work makes it a far cry from the sanctuary it could actually provide.
The reason for my earlier declaration was that, as a former trade union officer, I worked with union members from across the country who had experienced domestic abuse, including the inspirational Claire Throssell. We produced a workplace charter on domestic abuse to ensure that employers provide proper protection to their staff. Indeed, many Members of the House have signed it. That charter called for measures that are vital to any worker experiencing domestic abuse, such as paid leave, access to information and support, flexible working, and ensuring that managers are properly trained. It is not an understatement to say that those provisions can be life-saving.
One brave woman told me:
“After a few months in my role, my partner at the time started constantly calling to see what I was doing, turning up at my workplace at lunchtimes unexpectedly, or demanding that I be home for a certain time…I was walking around on eggshells at home, and now at work. The calls and visits became more frequent…I found myself making excuses for not being able to attend social events with colleagues, wearing clothes to hide bruises or taking sick leave when I couldn’t cover them up.”
Rather than this woman’s employer understanding the situation, the response was to suspend her.
We are not asking the world from employers, just that their workers are kept safe. Reasonable adjustments, such as changing a work number, and staggering start and finishing times, as well as having the option of stepping back from public-facing roles to avoid interacting with perpetrators, could make all the difference, especially ​when fleeing an abuser. Although nearly 50,000 workers are now covered by GMB’s workplace charter, it is not nearly enough. It will never be enough until every worker is protected. It should never be an optional extra for employers to keep their staff safe or ensure that they are not financially penalised. Without these measures, I am afraid that the Bill will be a missed opportunity to protect victims of domestic abuse in every part of their life.
"
Barack Obama,"This Republican shutdown did not have to happen. But I want every American to understand why it did happen. Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act. They’ve shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans. In other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job.
And many representatives, including an increasing number of Republicans, have made it clear that had they been allowed by Speaker Boehner to take a simple up or down vote on keeping the government open, with no partisan strings attached, enough votes from both parties would have kept the American people’s government open and operating.
We may not know the full impact of this Republican shutdown for some time. It will depend on how long it lasts. But we do know a couple of things. We know that the last time Republicans shut down the government in 1996, it hurt our economy. And unlike 1996, our economy is still recovering from the worst recession in generations.
We know that certain services and benefits that America’s seniors and veterans and business owners depend on must be put on hold. Certain offices, along with every national park and monument, must be closed. And while last night, I signed legislation to make sure our 1.4 million active-duty military are paid through the shutdown, hundreds of thousands of civilian workers -- many still on the job, many forced to stay home -- aren’t being paid, even if they have families to support and local businesses that rely on them. And we know that the longer this shutdown continues, the worse the effects will be. More families will be hurt. More businesses will be harmed.
So, once again, I urge House Republicans to reopen the government, restart the services Americans depend on, and allow the public servants who have been sent home to return to work. This is only going to happen when Republicans realize they don’t get to hold the entire economy hostage over ideological demands.
As I’ve said repeatedly, I am prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans to do the things we need to do to grow the economy and create jobs, and get our fiscal house in order over the long run. Although I should add this shutdown isn’t about deficits, or spending, or budgets. After all, our deficits are falling at the fastest pace in 50 years. We’ve cut them in half since I took office. In fact, many of the demands the Republicans are now making would actually raise our deficits.
No, this shutdown is not about deficits, it’s not about budgets. This shutdown is about rolling back our efforts to provide health insurance to folks who don’t have it. It’s all about rolling back the Affordable Care Act. This, more than anything else, seems to be what the Republican Party stands for these days. I know it’s strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda, but that apparently is what it is.
And of course, what’s stranger still is that shutting down our government doesn’t accomplish their stated goal. The Affordable Care Act is a law that passed the House; it passed the Senate. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was a central issue in last year’s election. It is settled, and it is here to stay. And because of its funding sources, it’s not impacted by a government shutdown.
And these Americans are here with me today because, even though the government is closed, a big part of the Affordable Care Act is now open for business. And for them, and millions like them, this is a historic day for a good reason. It’s been a long time coming, but today, Americans who have been forced to go without insurance can now visit healthcare.gov and enroll in affordable new plans that offer quality coverage. That starts today.
And people will have six months to sign up. So over the next six months, people are going to have the opportunity -- in many cases, for the first time in their lives -- to get affordable coverage that they desperately need.
Now, of course, if you’re one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, you don’t need to do a thing. You’re already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life-changing.
Let me just tell folks a few stories that are represented here today. A few years ago, Amanda Barrett left her job in New York to take care of her parents. And for a while, she had temporary insurance that covered her multiple sclerosis. But when it expired, many insurers wouldn’t cover her because of her MS. And she ended up paying $1,200 a month. That’s nowhere near affordable. So starting today, she can get covered for much less, because today’s new plan can’t use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else.
Sky-high premiums once forced Nancy Beigel to choose between paying her rent or paying for health insurance. She’s been uninsured ever since. So she pays all of her medical bills out of pocket, puts some on her credit card, making them even harder to pay. Nancy says, “They talk about those who fall through the cracks. I fell through the cracks 10 years ago and I’ve been stuck there ever since.” Well, starting today, Nancy can get covered just like everybody else.
Trinace Edwards was laid off from her job a year ago today. Six months ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. She couldn’t afford insurance on the individual market, so she hasn’t received treatment yet. Her daughter Lenace, a student at the University of Maryland, is considering dropping out of school to help pay her mom’s bills. Well, starting today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Trinace can get covered without forcing her daughter to give up on her dreams.
So if these stories of hardworking Americans sound familiar to you, well, starting today, you and your friends and your family and your coworkers can get covered, too. Just visit healthcare.gov, and there you can compare insurance plans, side by side, the same way you’d shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon. You enter some basic information, you’ll be presented with a list of quality, affordable plans that are available in your area, with clear descriptions of what each plan covers, and what it will cost. You’ll find more choices, more competition, and in many cases, lower prices -- most uninsured Americans will find that they can get covered for $100 or less.
And you don't have to take my word for it. Go on the website, healthcare.gov, check it out for yourself. And then show it to your family and your friends and help them get covered, just like mayors and churches and community groups and companies are already fanning out to do across the country.
And there’s a hotline where you can apply over the phone and get help with the application, or just get questions that you have answered by real people, in 150 different languages. So let me give you that number. The number is 1-800-318-2596 -- 1-800-318-2596. Check out healthcare.gov. Call that number. Show your family and friends how to use it. And we can get America covered, once and for all, so that the struggles that these folks have gone through and millions around the country have gone through for years finally get addressed.
And let me just remind people why I think this is so important. I heard a striking statistic yesterday -- if you get cancer, you are 70 percent more likely to live another five years if you have insurance than if you don’t. Think about that. That is what it means to have health insurance.
Set aside the issues of security and finances and how you’re impacted by that, the stress involved in not knowing whether or not you’re going to have health care. This is life-or-death stuff. Tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don’t have health insurance. Millions more live with the fear that they’ll go broke if they get sick. And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.
Already, millions of young adults have been able to stay on their parents’ plans until they turn 26. Millions of seniors already have gotten a discount on their prescription medicines. Already millions of families have actually received rebates from insurance companies that didn’t spend enough on their health care. So this law means more choice, more competition, lower costs for millions of Americans.
And this law doesn’t just mean economic security for our families. It means we’re finally addressing the biggest drivers of our long-term deficits. It means a stronger economy.
Remember most Republicans have made a whole bunch of predictions about this law that haven’t come true. There are no “death panels.” Costs haven’t skyrocketed; they’re growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. The last three years since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law are the three slowest rates of health spending growth on record.And contrary to Republican claims, this law hasn’t “destroyed” our economy. Over the past three and a half years, our businesses have created 7.5 million new jobs. Just today, we learned that our manufacturers are growing at the fastest rate in two and a half years. They have factored in the Affordable Care Act. They don't think it’s a problem. What’s weighing on the economy is not the Affordable Care Act, but the constant series of crises and the unwillingness to pass a reasonable budget by a faction of the Republican Party.
To put that in context, there were five times more users in the marketplace this morning than have ever been on Medicare.gov at one time. That gives you a sense of how important this is to millions of Americans around the country, and that’s a good thing. And we're going to be speeding things up in the next few hours to handle all this demand that exceeds anything that we had expected.
Consider that just a couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system. And within days, they found a glitch, so they fixed it. I don’t remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads -- or threatening to shut down the company if they didn’t. That’s not how we do things in America. We don’t actively root for failure. We get to work, we make things happen, we make them better, we keep going.
So in that context, I'll work with anybody who’s got a serious idea to make the Affordable Care Act work better. I've said that repeatedly. But as long as I am President, I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions of hardworking Americans.
I want Republicans in Congress to know these are the Americans you’d hurt if you were allowed to dismantle this law. Americans like Amanda, Nancy, and Trinace, who now finally have the opportunity for basic security and peace of mind of health care just like everybody else -- including members of Congress. The notion that you’d make a condition for reopening the government that I make sure these folks don’t have health care -- that doesn’t make any sense. It doesn’t make any sense.
And this may be why you've got many Republican governors and senators and even a growing number of reasonable Republican congressmen who are telling the extreme right of their party to knock it off, pass a budget, move on.
And I want to underscore the fact that Congress doesn’t just have to end this shutdown and reopen the government -- Congress generally has to stop governing by crisis. They have to break this habit. It is a drag on the economy. It is not worthy of this country.
For example, one of the most important things Congress has to do in the next couple weeks is to raise what's called the debt ceiling. And it's important to understand what this is. This is a routine vote. Congress has taken this vote 45 times to raise the debt ceiling since Ronald Reagan took office. It does not cost taxpayers a single dime. It does not grow our deficits by a single dime. It does not authorize anybody to spend any new money whatsoever. All it does is authorize the Treasury to pay the bills on what Congress has already spent.
Think about that. If you buy a car and you’ve got a car note, you do not save money by not paying your car note. You’re just a deadbeat. If you buy a house, you don’t save money by not authorizing yourself to pay the mortgage. You’re just going to be foreclosed on your home. That’s what this is about.
It is routine. It is what they’re supposed to do. This is not a concession to me. It is not some demand that’s unreasonable that I’m making. This is what Congress is supposed to do as a routine matter. And they shouldn’t wait until the last minute to do it. The last time Republicans even threatened this course of action -- many of you remember, back in 2011 -- our economy staggered, our credit rating was downgraded for the first time. If they go through with it this time and force the United States to default on its obligations for the first time in history, it would be far more dangerous than a government shutdown -- as bad as a shutdown is. It would be an economic shutdown.
There are a whole bunch of things that I’d like to see passed through Congress that the House Republicans haven’t passed yet, and I’m not out there saying, well, I’m not -- I’m going to let America default unless Congress does something that they don’t want to do. That’s not how adults operate. Certainly that’s not how our government should operate. And that’s true whether there’s a Democrat in this office or a Republican in this office. Doesn’t matter whether it’s a Democratic House of Representatives or a Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- there are certain rules that everybody abides by because we don’t want to hurt other people just because we have a political disagreement.
I am more than happy to work with them on all kinds of issues. I want to get back to work on the things that the American people sent us here to work on -- creating new jobs, new growth, new security for our middle class.
We’re better than this. Certainly the American people are a lot better than this. And I believe that what we’ve accomplished for Amanda, and Nancy, and Trinace, and tens of millions of their fellow citizens- on this day proves that even when the odds are long and the obstacles are many, we are and always will be a country that can do great things together.
Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you, all of you, for the great work that you’re doing. And thank you, Kathleen Sebelius, for the outstanding work that she’s doing making sure that millions of Americans can get health insurance.
Thank you.
"
Margaret Thatcher,"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the outcome of the inquiry into the disclosure of certain information in my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General’s letter of 6 January.
As the House knows, the chairman of Westland plc, Sir John Cuckney, wrote to me on 30 December 1985 asking whether Westland would no longer be considered a European company by the Government if a minority shareholding in the company were held by a major international group from a NATO country outside Europe.
This question was of fundamental importance to the company in making its decision as to what course it was best to follow in the interests of the company and its employees. It was therefore essential to be sure that my reply should be in no way misleading to anyone who might rely upon it in making commercial judgments and decisions.
The reply was accordingly considered among the Departments concerned, and the text of my letter of 1 January 1986 was agreed in detail by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my right hon. Friends the then Secretary of State for Defence and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and finally by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General.
My letter was made public.
Two days later, on 3 January, my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Defence replied to a letter of the same date from Mr. Horne of Lloyds Merchant Bank asking him a number of questions, covering some of the same ground as my own reply to Sir John Cuckney. The texts of the letters became public that same day.
My right hon. Friend’s reply was not cleared or even discussed with the relevant Cabinet colleagues. Moreover, although the reply was also material to the commercial judgments and decisions that would have to be made, my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General was not invited to scrutinise the letter before it was issued.
On the morning of 6 January, my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General wrote to my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Defence. He said—and I quote:
“It is foreseeable that your letter will be relied upon by the Westland Board and its shareholders.
Consistently with the advice I gave to the Prime Minister on 31 December, the Government in such circumstances is under a duty not to give information which is incomplete or inaccurate in any material particular.”
The letter continued:
“On the basis of the information contained in the documents to which I have referred, which I emphasise are all that I have seen, the sentence in your letter to Mr. Home does in my opinion contain material inaccuracies in the respects I have mentioned, and I therefore must advise that you should write again to Mr. Horne correcting the inaccuracies.”
That is the end of the quotation.
I have quoted extensively from the letter which, as hon. Members will know, was published a week ago. As I have already indicated, it was especially important in this situation for statements made on behalf of the Government, on which commercial judgments might be based, to be accurate and in no way misleading.
That being so, it was a matter of duty that it should be made known publicly that there were thought to be ​ material inaccuracies which needed to be corrected in the letter of my right hon. Friend. Moreover, it was urgent that it should become public knowledge before 4 pm that afternoon, 6 January, when Sir John Cuckney was due to hold a press conference to announce the Westland board’s recommendation to shareholders of a revised proposal from the United Technologies Corporation-Fiat consortium.
These considerations were very much in the mind of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the copy of the Solicitor-General’s letter was brought to his attention at about 1.30 pm that afternoon of 6 January. He took the view that the fact that the Solicitor-General had written to the then Secretary of State for Defence, and the opinion he had expressed, should be brought into the public domain as soon as possible. He asked his officials to discuss with my office whether the disclosure should be made, and, if so, whether it should be made from 10 Downing street, as he said he would prefer.
My right hon. and learned Friend made it clear that, subject to the agreement of my office, he was giving authority for the disclosure to be made from the Department of Trade and Industry, if it was not made from 10 Downing street. He expressed no view as to the form in which the disclosure should be made, though it was clear to all concerned that in the circumstances it was not possible to proceed by way of an agreed statement.
My office were accordingly approached. They did not seek my agreement: they considered—and they were right — that I should agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that the fact that the then Defence Secretary’s letter of 3 January was thought by the Solicitor-General to contain material inaccuracies which needed to be corrected should become public knowledge as soon as possible, and before Sir John Cuckney’s press conference. It was accepted that the Department of Trade and Industry should disclose that fact and that, in view of the urgency of the matter, the disclosure should be made by means of a telephone communication to the Press Association.
The report finds, in the light of the evidence, that the Department of Trade and Industry acted in good faith in the knowledge that it had the authority of its Secretary of State and cover from my office for proceeding. An official of the Department accordingly told a representative of the Press Association of the letter by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General and material elements of what it said. The company was also informed. The information was on the Press Association tapes at 3.30 pm.
My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was, in my judgment, right in thinking that it was important that the possible existence of material inaccuracies in the letter of 3 January by the then Secretary of State for Defence should become a matter of public knowledge, if possible before Sir John Cuckney’s press conference at 4 pm that day. In so far as what my office said to the Department of Trade and Industry was based on the belief that I should have taken that view, had I been consulted, it was right. ​ My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General has authorised me to inform the House that, having considered the report by the head of the Civil Service, and on the material before him, he has decided after consultation with, and with the full agreement of, the Director of Public Prosecutions and senior Treasury counsel, that there is no justification for the institution of proceedings under the Official Secrets Act 1911 in respect of any of the persons concerned in this matter.
In order that there should be no impediment to cooperation in the inquiry, my right hon. and learned Friend had authorised the head of the Civil Service to tell one of the officials concerned, whose testimony would be vital to the inquiry, that he had my right hon. and learned Friend’s authority to say that, provided that he received full co-operation in his inquiry, the official concerned would not be prosecuted in respect of anything said during the course of the inquiry.
The head of the Civil Service did, indeed, receive full co-operation not only from that official but from all concerned. My right hon. and learned Friend tells me that he is satisfied that that in no way interfered with the course of justice: on the facts as disclosed in the inquiry there would have been no question of proceeding against the official concerned.
"
Sue Hayman,"Good afternoon, conference.
Last week we witnessed an extraordinary global event. Millions of young people took to the streets across the world to demand more action in the fight against climate change. I’m sure many of you, like me, joined them to show your support.
Millions of young people. Inspired to make a difference by a Swedish teenager. So let us applaud Greta Thunberg!
On March 26 this year I stood up in Parliament and called on this Tory Government to declare an Environment and Climate Emergency. They refused. They said they are doing enough. They are not.
On May Day, Jeremy Corbyn and I went back to Parliament. We declared a Climate Emergency, anyway. It is Labour that is leading the way. Last year we published Labour’s plans for a Green Transformation. We set out how we would decarbonise our economy. We have built on those plans.
Earlier today you heard it. Our plans for a Green Industrial Revolution.
And in these debates we have heard more of your ideas and aims. But I have been working on another revolution. A revolution in food and farming. It is an essential part of our effort to combat climate change.
Agriculture contributes nearly six million tonnes of carbon dioxide to our carbon footprint. A much higher proportion of other greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxides. Land use offsets some of these emissions but our chosen diets, our food packaging and food wastage contributes more again.
Food waste. A symptom of a billion dollar industry astride a broken system. A system which leads to food banks. Do you remember what Boris Johnson said about food banks? He said, “When I was running London, I set up loads of food banks. They are fantastic things.”
Food banks, Mr Johnson, are not ‘fantastic’. Food banks are the result of Tory austerity. They are the product of poverty, of food insecurity. They are the failure of Tory changes to the benefits system. They are late welfare payments. They are privatised work assessments. They are a punitive, heartless sanctions regime. How else is it, in 21st century Britain, in one of the richest countries in the world, more than one million emergency food supplies are handed out each year.
How, in Britain, can there be children scavenging in school bins for apple cores because there is no food at home? How can people with malnutrition be taking 200,000 hospital bed days each year? Hospital admissions for malnutrition have trebled under the Tories and their Lib Dem coalition partners.
It’s you, Prime Minister. Tories did away with child poverty targets. Tories won’t monitor hunger. And you have no strategy for food security. Just a taste for chlorinated chicken. Healthy food is not a luxury. It is a basic human right.
Today , I am announcing that the next Labour government will introduce a Right to Food, embedded in UK law, underpinned by an over-arching national food strategy. We will introduce a Fair Food Act. We will ensure that everyone has access to nutritious and sustainable food.
That means that everyone is able to feed themselves. Sufficient income. Reduced living costs. Social welfare. A real Living Wage. No more bedroom tax. An uprated carers’ allowance. And an end to punitive benefit sanctions.
What kind of barbaric society punishes someone for missing an appointment by making their children go hungry? Our measures mean that Labour will halve food bank usage within our first year in Government. And we aim to end the need for food banks completely within three years.
Labour will set up a National Food Commission to uphold the Right to Food. We will set up a £6m People’s Access to Food Fund in the 50 most insecure food areas in the country.
We will ensure decent pay and collective bargaining for food and agricultural workers. And we will ensure and protect access to trade union representation for all food and agricultural workers.
Conference, we will back British farmers and food producers to produce sustainable, quality foods. We will not allow a no-deal Brexit to flood the UK with imported food produced to lower environmental, social or animal welfare standards.
Labour will not agree free trade deals or EU arrangements that threatens our existing food standards. We will stand up for our nation’s food security. Our nutrition. Our environment, Our public health. And our farmers, the bedrock of our rural communities.
Labour’s food and farming strategy will address packaging and waste. Hundreds of thousands of people use food banks, but we throw away 10 million tonnes of food a year. 10 million tonnes of perfectly good food.
That’s a quarter of all food purchased in a year, at a cost of over £20 billion. And it is equivalent to more than 20 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot tackle climate change unless we sort out our food systems. A Labour government will commit to net zero emissions from farming and land use. The scope for carbon storage on agricultural land is huge. I’m already working with the National Farmers Union and sustainability organisations to make that happen.
And I have also put animal welfare rights at the heart of Labour’s approach. Recently I published Labour’s animal welfare manifesto, a 50-point plan. The most comprehensive approach yet to promoting animal welfare standards and animal rights. It covers the way we treat farm animals as well as wild and domestic animals. It’s on the Labour Party website but you can also pick up a copy here.
But conference, let me leave you with this. When someone tells you that all political parties are the same, you tell them this.
A Labour Government will never let our children go hungry. And a Labour Government will make sure no-one has to use a food bank. Because every single person has a right to decent food. After a decade of Tories we will give people that right, as we start Rebuilding Britain.

Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. That's so nice. Sit, please. We have tens of thousands of people watching us right down the road -- tens of thousands. So I congratulate you. And at least we picked a beautiful day. You can't get a more beautiful day.
I want to thank our Vice President, Mike Pence, for that wonderful introduction. I also want to thank you and Karen for being true champions for life. Thank you, and thank Karen.
Today, I'm honored and really proud to be the first President to stand with you here at the White House to address the 45th March for Life. That's very, very special -- 45th March for Life.
And this is a truly remarkable group. Today, tens of thousands of families, students, and patriots -- and, really, just great citizens -- gather here in our nation’s capital. You come from many backgrounds, many places. But you all come for one beautiful cause: to build a society where life is celebrated, protected, and cherished.
The March for Life is a movement born out of love. You love your families, you love your neighbors, you love our nation, and you love every child, born and unborn, because you believe that every life is sacred, that every child is a precious gift from God.
We know that life is the greatest miracle of all. We see it in the eyes of every new mother who cradles that wonderful, innocent, and glorious newborn child in her loving arms.
I want to thank every person here today and all across our country who works with such big hearts and tireless devotion to make sure that parents have the care and support they need to choose life. Because of you, tens of thousands of Americans have been born and reached their full, God-given potential -- because of you.
You're living witnesses of this year’s March for Life theme. And that theme is: Love saves lives. Wade has resulted in some of the most permissive abortion laws anywhere in the world. For example, in the United States, it's one of only seven countries to allow elective late-term abortions, along with China, North Korea, and others.
. It is wrong; it has to change. Americans are more and more pro-life. You see that all the time. In fact, only 12 percent of Americans support abortion on demand at any time.
Under my administration, we will always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence, and that is the right to life. And I will say, our country is doing really well. Our economy is perhaps the best it's ever been. You look at the job numbers; you look at the companies pouring back into our country; you look at the stock market at an all-time high; unemployment, 17-year low.
Unemployment for African American workers, at the lowest mark in the history of our country. Unemployment for Hispanic, at a record low in history. Unemployment for women, think of this, at an 18-year low. We're really proud of what we're doing.
And during my first week in office, I reinstated a policy first put in place by President Ronald Reagan, the Mexico City policy. And I call upon the Senate to pass this important law and send it to my desk for signing.
On the National Day of Prayer, I signed an executive order to protect religious liberty. Today, I’m announcing that we have just issued a new proposal to protect conscience rights and religious freedoms of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. So important.
I have also just reversed the previous administration’s policy that restricted states’ efforts to direct Medicaid funding away from abortion facilities that violate the law.
We are protecting the sanctity of life and the family as the foundation of our society. But this movement can only succeed with the heart and the soul and the prayer of the people.
Here with us today is Marianne Donadio from Greensboro, North Carolina. Where is Marianne? Hello. Come on up here, Marianne. Come. Marianne was 17 when she found out she was pregnant. At first, she felt like she had no place to turn. But when she told her parents, they responded with total love, total affection, total support. Great parents? Great?
I thought you were going to say that. I had to be careful. She named him Benedict, which means blessing.
Marianne was so grateful for her parents’ love and support that she felt called to serve those who were not as fortunate as her. She joined with others in her community to start a maternity home to care for homeless women who were pregnant. That's great. They named it “Room at the Inn.”
Today, Marianne and her husband, Don, are the parents of six beautiful children, and her eldest son Benedict and her daughter Maria join us here today. Where are they. How are you? That's great.
Over the last 15 years, Room at the Inn has provided housing, childcare, counseling, education, and job training to more than 400 women. Even more importantly, it has given them hope. It has shown each woman that she is not forgotten, that she is not alone, and that she really now has a whole family of people who will help her succeed.
That hope is the true gift of this incredible movement that brings us together today. It is the gift of friendship, the gift of mentorship, and the gift of encouragement, love, and support. Those are beautiful words, and those are beautiful gifts. And most importantly of all, it is the gift of life itself.
That is why we march. That is why we pray. And that is why we declare that America’s future will be filled with goodness, peace, joy, dignity, and life for every child of God.
Thank you to the March for Life -- special, special people. And we are with you all the way. May God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Karen Bradley,"I apologise for beginning my statement by correcting you, Mr Speaker, but I am now the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The Department has a new word in its name.
I am here to give an update on the proposed merger between 21st Century Fox and Sky plc and on my decision about whether to refer the transaction for a full six-month investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. I should first remind the House that in my quasi-judicial role I must, first, come to a decision on the basis of relevant evidence; secondly, act independently in a process that is fair and impartial; and, thirdly, take my decision as promptly as is reasonably practicable. I am committed to transparency and openness in this process and have been clear that my decisions can be influenced only by facts, not by opinions, and that they can be influenced only by the evidence, not by who shouts the loudest.
I turn, first, to media plurality, and I can confirm that none of the representations received has persuaded me to change my position. Accordingly, I can confirm my intention to make a referral on the media plurality ground to the CMA. On the question of commitment to broadcasting standards, over the summer my officials reviewed the almost 43,000 representations received. A significant majority of them were campaign-inspired, arguing against the merger going ahead but generally without providing new or further evidence or commenting on Ofcom’s approach. Overall, only 30 of the 43,000 representations were substantive, raising potentially new evidence or commenting on Ofcom’s approach. Almost all were related to commitment to broadcasting standards.
In the light of those representations, I asked Ofcom to provide further advice. May I put on record my gratitude to Ofcom for its efforts to respond to the questions that were raised? I am, today, publishing the exchanges between my Department and Ofcom. In those exchanges, I sought clarification on, first, the threshold that Ofcom applied to its consideration of the commitment to broadcasting standards ground; secondly, the consideration made of broadcasting compliance; and, thirdly, the consideration made of corporate governance issues. I also asked Ofcom to consider whether any of the new, substantive representations that I received affected its assessment.
I have taken careful account of all relevant representations and Ofcom’s advice, and I have today, as required by the legislation, written to the parties to inform them that I am now minded to refer the merger to the CMA on the grounds of genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. I will now set out the technical reasons for that decision.
At the time, Ofcom appeared to be unequivocal. Following the additional representations,
Ofcom has further clarified that
“while we consider there are non-fanciful concerns, we do not consider that these are such as may justify a reference in relation to the broadcast standards public interest consideration.”
The existence of non-fanciful concerns means that, as a matter of law, the threshold for a reference on the broadcasting standards ground is met. In the light of all the representations and Ofcom’s additional advice, I believe that those concerns are sufficient to warrant the exercise of my discretion to refer.
The first concern, which was raised in Ofcom’s public interest report, was that Fox did not have adequate compliance procedures in place for the broadcast of Fox News in the UK and that it took action to improve its approach to compliance only after Ofcom expressed concerns. Ofcom has confirmed it considers that to raise concerns that are non-fanciful but not sufficiently serious to warrant referral. I consider that those non-fanciful concerns warrant further consideration. The fact that Fox belatedly established such procedures does not ease my concerns, and nor does Fox’s compliance history.
Ofcom was reassured by the existence of the compliance regime, which provides licensees with an incentive to comply. However, it is clear to me that Parliament intended the scrutiny of whether an acquiring party has a “genuine commitment” to attaining broadcasting standards objectives to happen before a merger takes place. Third parties also raised concerns about what they termed the “Foxification” of Fox-owned news outlets internationally. On the evidence before me, I am not able to conclude that that raises non-fanciful concerns. However, I consider it important that entities that adopt controversial or partisan approaches to news and current affairs in other jurisdictions should, at the same time, have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards here. Those are matters the CMA may wish to consider in the event of a referral.
I turn to the question of corporate governance failures. Ofcom states in its latest correspondence that such failures raise non-fanciful concerns in relation to the broadcasting standards ground. However, it again concludes that those concerns do not warrant a reference. I agree that corporate governance issues at Fox raise non-fanciful concerns, but in my view it would be appropriate for those concerns to be considered further by the CMA. I agree with the view that, in this context, my proper concern is whether Fox will have a genuine commitment to attaining broadcasting standards objectives. However, I am not confident that weaknesses in Fox’s corporate governance arrangements are incapable of affecting compliance in the broadcasting standards context. I have outstanding non-fanciful concerns about these matters, and I am of the view that they should be considered further by the CMA.
Before I come to a final decision, I am required, under the Enterprise Act 2002, to allow the parties to make representations on my proposed decision, and that is the reason why my decision remains, at this stage, a “minded to” one. I have given the parties 10 working days to respond. Following receipt of any representations from the parties, I will aim to come to my final decision in relation to both grounds as promptly as I can.​
I remind the House that should I decide to refer on one or both grounds, the merger will be subject to a full and detailed investigation by the CMA over a six-month period. Such a referral does not signal the outcome of that investigation. Given the quasi-judicial nature of this matter, my decision cannot be guided by the parliamentary timetable. If I come to my decision during recess, I will write, as I have done previously, and return to this House at the earliest possible opportunity to provide an update. I commend this statement to the House.
"
Barack Obama,"Good afternoon, everybody. Let me begin by once again thanking the government and the people of Malaysia for hosting us at the U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia Summits. These gatherings are enormous undertakings, but thanks to Malaysia’s leadership and incredible hospitality, they have been a great success.
Earlier this week, as I headed to this region, there was a headline in one of our publications back home that asked -- “Obama’s Asian Distraction?” And the premise seemed to be that this region was somehow disconnected from pressing global events. I could not disagree more. This region is not a distraction from the world’s central challenges, like terrorism. The Asia Pacific is absolutely critical to promoting security, prosperity and human dignity around the world. That’s why I’ve devoted so much of my foreign policy to deepening America’s engagement with this region. And I’m pleased that on this trip we made progress across the board.
With my fellow leaders from Japan, Australia and the Philippines, I reaffirmed that our treaty alliances remain the foundation of regional security. The United States is boosting our support for the Philippines' maritime capabilities and those of our regional partners. At the U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia Summits, a key topic was the South China Sea, and many leaders spoke about the need to uphold international principles, including the freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of disputes. And to make sure we keep deepening our partnership here in Southeast Asia, I invited all 10 ASEAN leaders to the United States next year. I’m pleased they accepted, and I look forward to continuing our work.
On the economic front, we worked with our APEC partners to advance a regional economic order where all nations play by the same set of rules. Based on my meeting with our Trans-Pacific Partnership countries, I am optimistic that our 12 nations will approve this pact and that we can increasingly focus on implementing it. 
APEC joined the G20 in sending an unequivocal message that we need to reach an ambitious climate change agreement in Paris. I also want to note the landmark step we took this week with more than 30 other nations at the OECD to dramatically reduce subsidies for coal-fired power plants around the world -- which is an important way to advance the fight against climate change.  Of course, given the events of this week, much of my work here in Asia focused on the urgent threat of terrorism. Today, families in too many nations are grieving the senseless loss of their loved ones in the attacks in France and in Mali. As Americans, we remember Nohemi Gonzalez, who was just 23 years old, a design major from California State University. She was in Paris to pursue her dream of designing innovations that would improve the lives of people around the world. And we remember Anita Datar of Maryland. She’s a veteran of the Peace Corps, a mother to her young son, who devoted her life to helping the world’s poor, including women and girls in Mali, lift themselves up with health and education. 
Nohemi and Anita embodied the values of service and compassion that no terrorist can extinguish. Their legacy will endure in the family and friends who carry on their work. They remind me of my daughters, or my mother, who, on the one hand, had their whole life ahead of them, and on the other hand, had devoted their lives to helping other people. And it is worth us remembering when we look at the statistics that there are beautiful, wonderful lives behind the terrible death tolls that we see in these places.
Over the years, our friends here in Asia have been victims of terrorism, and many of them are close counterterrorism partners with us. So my time here has also been an opportunity to work with many of our partners in the Asia Pacific that are members of our coalition against ISIL -- Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
Which brings me to the point I want to emphasize today. For more than a year, the United States has built and led a broad coalition against ISIL of some 65 nations. Given the frequent focus on America’s leadership of this campaign, sometimes the contributions of our partners are overlooked. In fact, since the G20, a number of our coalition members have stepped up with new commitments. So today I want to take a moment to recognize how our allies and partners help advance every element of our strategy. 
Nearly two dozen nations -- among them Turkey and our Arab partners -- contribute in some way to the military campaign, which has taken more than 8,000 strikes against ISIL so far. And as I’ve said, we’re ready to welcome or cooperate with other countries that are determined to truly fight ISIL as well. Fifteen countries have deployed personnel to train and support local forces in Iraq. The United Arab Emirates and Germany are organizing 25 coalition partners in helping to stabilize areas in Iraq liberated from ISIL. Italy is coordinating the multinational effort to train Iraqi police. 
On the political front, U.S. leadership brought all the key countries together in the Vienna to discuss a common understanding on the principles for ending the Syrian civil war. On the humanitarian front, the United States is helping to lead the effort to mobilize more aid for the Syrian people, including refugees.  
More than 40 countries have now passed or strengthened laws to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, and 34 nations, including the United States, have arrested foreign terrorist fighters. Saudi Arabia is helping to coordinate the crackdown on ISIL financing. The United Arab Emirates’ new messaging center is working to discredit ISIL’s propaganda, and Malaysia just announced the creation of its own center to do the same. And by joining our summit at the United Nations that we organized this fall, more than 100 nations, more than 20 multilateral institutions and some 120 civil society groups -- including many leaders from Muslim communities around the world -- have become part of a global movement against ISIL and its twisted ideology.
All of which is to say that our coalition will not relent. We will not accept the idea that terrorist assaults on restaurants and theaters and hotels are the new normal -- or that we are powerless to stop them. After all, that’s precisely what terrorists like ISIL want, because, ultimately, that’s the only way that they can win. That’s the very nature of terrorism --they can’t beat us on the battlefield, so they try to terrorize us into being afraid, into changing our patterns of behavior, into panicking, into abandoning our allies and partners, into retreating from the world. And as President, I will not let that happen.  
In our diverse societies, everybody can do their part. And we will not give in to fear, or start turning on each other, or treating some people differently because of religion or race or background. That wouldn’t just be a betrayal of our values, it would also feed ISIL’s propaganda -- there assertion, which is absolutely false, that we must absolutely reject, that we are somehow at war with an entire religion. The United States could never be at war with any religion because America is made up of multiple religions. We're strengthened by people from every religion, including Muslim Americans. 
The United States will continue to lead this global coalition. We are intensifying our strategy on all fronts, with local partners on the ground. We are going to keep on rolling back ISIL in Iraq and in Syria, and take out more of their leaders and commanders so that they do not threaten us. And we will destroy this terrorist organization. 
And we’ll keep working with our allies and partners for the opportunity and justice that helps defeat violent extremism. We’ll keep standing up for the human rights and dignity of all people -- because that is contrary to what these terrorists believe. That's part of how we defeat them. And I'm confident we will succeed. The hateful vision of an organization like ISIL is no match for the strength of nations and people around the world who are united to live in security and peace and in harmony.
So with that, I'm going to take a couple of questions. We'll start with Angela Greiling-Keane of Bloomberg.
It will be helpful if Russia directs its focus on ISIL, and I do think that as a consequence of ISIL claiming responsibility for bringing down their plane, there is an increasing awareness on the part of President Putin that ISIL poses a greater threat to them than anything else in the region. The question at this point is whether they can make the strategic adjustment that allows them to be effective partners with us and the other 65 countries who are already part of the counter-ISIL campaign. And we don't know that yet. 
So far, over the last several weeks, when they started taking strikes in Syria, their principal targets have been the moderate opposition that they felt threatened Assad. Their principal goal appeared to be -- if you follow the strikes that they took -- to fortify the position of the Assad regime. And that does not add to our efforts against ISIL. In some ways, it strengthens it because ISIL is also fighting many of those groups that the Russians were hitting.
When we were in Turkey I discussed with President Putin, in a brief pull-aside, his need to recognize that he needs to go after the people who killed Russian citizens. And those aren’t the groups that they were currently hitting with strikes. So they're going to have to make an adjustment in terms of what they're prioritizing. 
More broadly -- I’ve said this before; I said it to President Putin five years ago and I repeated it to him just a few days ago -- the issue with Assad is not simply the way that he has treated his people. It’s not just a human rights issues. It’s not just a question of supporting somebody who has been ruthlessly dropping bombs on his own civilian populations. As a practical matter, it is not conceivable that Mr. Assad can regain legitimacy in a country in which a large majority of that country despises Assad and will not stop fighting so long as he’s in power, which means that the civil war perpetuates itself.
And so the goal in Vienna is to see if -- with all the countries around the table, including Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, and Iran, and Russia, as well as the United States and other countries that have concerns about this -- whether we can arrive at a political transition process that recognizes the need for a new government and can quell the fighting and bring about a ceasefire and allows all of us to refocus our attention on this barbaric organization that is killing so many people.
Russia has not officially committed to a transition of Assad moving out, but they did agree to the political transition process. And I think we’ll find out over the next several weeks whether or not we can bring about that change of perspective with the Russians.
Keep in mind that we all have an interest in maintaining a Syrian state because we don’t want complete chaos. I mean, and there are problems that we’ve seen in, for example, Lebanon, when the machinery of state entirely breaks down. So there’s going to be a need for the international community and the United Nations to work in order to maintain -- maintaining a Syrian state and be able to move forward with a political transition that’s orderly. And that’s going to be difficult, but that’s what we have to focus on.
In terms of the position of the United States and the other 65 members of the coalition, my view on Assad is it will not work to keep him in power. We can’t stop the fighting. Even if I were to cynically say that my priority is ISIL and not removing Assad regardless of the terrible things that he’s done to his people, the United States could not stop the fighting in Syria by those who are opposed to Assad’s rule. And so this is a practical issue, not just a matter of conscience. And I think that there are a large number of members of this coalition, including President Hollande, who agree with me on that.  Michael Shear.
I don’t know what we’ll discover with respect to what was going on at CENTCOM. I think that’s something that’s best left to the IG and the processes. I have communicated once again to both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as well as Secretary Carter that I expect that we get to the bottom of whether or not what you describe has been happening.
There are always going to be some disputes with respect to how to interpret facts on the ground. I get intelligence briefings every single day, and there are times where they’re making their best judgments -- they’ll say, with moderate confidence, or low confidence, or high confidence, this is what we think is happening. There may be times where there are disputes internally among various intelligence agencies about that. But I don’t know the details of this. What I do know is my expectation, which is the highest fidelity to facts, data -- the truth. 
And if there are disagreements in terms of how folks are interpreting the facts, then that should be reflected in the reports that we receive -- that some folks think this is going on; other folks thinks that’s going on. And that’s part of what I weigh in terms of making decisions. 
One last thing I’ll say, though -- as a consumer of this intelligence, it’s not as if I’ve been receiving wonderfully rosy, glowing portraits of what’s been happening in Iraq and Syria over the last year and a half. So to the extent that it’s been shaded -- again, I don’t know the details of what the IG may discover -- but it feels to me like, at my level at least, we’ve had a pretty clear-eyed, sober assessment of where we’ve made real progress and where we have not. 
On Paris, a lot of the discussion out here both at the G20, APEC, and finally here at ASEAN, has been that we’ve got to get a strong Paris deal. And I’m optimistic that we can -- 160 countries have now put forward their national targets for how they can reduce emissions; that accounts for about 90 percent of the world’s emitters. 
And the key to a strong agreement is going to be that, although there’s going to be differentiation between countries -- the United States doesn't expect that our obligations are identical to Laos, for example, given our levels of development, how much carbon we emit compared to theirs -- that everybody does have a plan, that everybody is accountable to a single set of reporting requirements, that there’s transparency about what each country is doing -- that once we’ve set that architecture in place, in five years time, we can review what we’ve done, turn up the dials in light of additional information and additional technology. In some cases, we may make progress faster than we expected, and we can increase our targets. So the key is to make sure that everybody is doing their part.
You raise one important issue, and that is climate finance. There are going to be a number of countries who recognize the threat of climate change, want to do something about it, but they also have large populations suffering from extreme poverty, who don't have electricity, who don't have the ability to feed their families. And any leader of those countries has to ask themselves, am I going to be sacrificing development and poverty alleviation in order to deal with climate change, particularly since a lot of more developed countries are responsible for at least the current carbon emissions that are causing climate change.
And so the answer to that we’ve all agreed is a finance mechanism to help these countries adapt -- in some cases, leapfrog old technologies so that instead of building old, dirty power plants, here are some smart, clean-energy plants. And we’ll help you through technology transfer and financing so that you can achieve your development goals, but not add to the carbon problem.
So far, with a target of $100 billion, we’ve reached between private and public sources $62 billion, and that target did not need to be met until 2020, based on our original commitments. So we're well on our way to meeting these commitments. And it’s a smart investment for us to make.
Sometimes, back home, critics will argue, there’s no point in us doing something about getting our house in order when it comes to climate change because other countries won’t do anything and it will just mean that we're in a less competitive position. Well, when I met with President Xi and China signed on to an aggressive commitment, that took a major argument away from those critics. We now the two largest emitters signed on. And it makes sense for us and the Chinese and the Europeans and others to help these countries, because, ultimately, if a country like India, for example, with over a billion people, is a major polluter, that's going to affect all of us. If, on the other hand, they're developing and growing in a clean way, that's going to be good for all of us.
I guess you want to know how the atmosphere, as a consequence of the attack in Paris would affect it. Look, I think it is absolutely vital for every country, every leader to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business, and that Paris -- one of the most beautiful, enticing cities in the world -- is not going to be cowered by the violent, demented actions of a few. 
And that's part of the overall message that I want to very clearly send the American people. We do not succumb to fear. That's the primary power that these terrorists have over us. They cannot strike a mortal blow against the United States, or against France, or against a country like Malaysia. But they can make people fearful. And that's understandable, because that could have been us; that could have been our families; that could have been our children in these places. And our hearts are broken when we see these images. 
But in addition to hunting down terrorists, in addition to effective intelligence, and in addition to missile strikes, and in addition to cutting off financing and all the other things that we're doing, the most powerful tool we have to fight ISIL is to say that we’re not afraid; to not elevate them; to somehow buy into their fantasy that they’re doing something important. They’re a bunch of killers. And there have been people throughout human history who can find an excuse to kill people because they don’t think like them or look like them. And we fight them, and we beat them, and we don’t change our institutions and our culture and our values because of them. 
I want to be very clear about this. I am not afraid that ISIL will beat us because of their operations. When I see a headline that says this individual who designed this plot in Paris is a mastermind -- he’s not a mastermind. He found a few other vicious people, got hands on some fairly conventional weapons, and, sadly, it turns out that if you’re willing to die, you can kill a lot of people. 
And so it is in our capacity to roll up those networks. Now, we got to take precautions, we have to take it seriously, and we have to go at the heart of the problem that exists inside of Syria and Iraq right now. And we have to address the broader issues that exist in a tiny fraction of the Muslim community. But it is a real problem that leaders -- from Prime Minister Najib to the President of Indonesia and others who have large Muslim populations -- acknowledge. A country like Indonesia has 250 million people; if just a tiny fraction of those are in some ways attracted by a vicious ideology like ISIL’s, then that’s a real problem for us. And so tools like countering this narrative, and Muslim clerics and political leaders and community leaders coming forward and making sure that our children are not being fed this kind of bile, that’s critically important as well. But in all of this, we cannot respond from fear. And the American people, in the past, have confronted some very real, enormous threats, and we beat them. We vanquished them. This will be no different.
Kevin Corke.
The good news is, is the U.S. military has become very good at this. I think that there have been some circumstances where the military proceeds in steps and are continually reevaluating whether, well, maybe this is a situation where we can, in fact, take the strike without a lot of civilian casualties. 
A good example with the recent trucks that were struck. There may be ways in which warnings can be given to the drivers-- many of whom may not work for ISIL, they may just be for hire or being forced into it -- so that they better abandon those trucks before we shoot them down, because we’re shooting them down. So that’s the kind of conversation, and that’s been ongoing throughout the process.
With respect to immigration reform, I can’t comment on the ins and outs of the legal case. I’ve said before and I’ll say again, I am confident that the rules and executive action that I put forward are squarely within the category of prosecutorial discretion that historically has been under a President’s power. And you’ve got lower courts who’ve disagreed, but we think that past precedent is on our side.
Substantively, I’ve got 11 million people in our countries, many of whom are working, paying taxes, our neighbors, coworkers, friends who’ve lived in the United States for a very long time. We’re not going to deport them, despite what some political leaders may say. It would be contrary to who we are, would be too costly, is too impractical. What we want to do is allow them to get out of the shadows and to get right with the law, pay a fine, go to the back of the line, but hopefully, over time, be contributors to society.
Of course, none of this would be necessary if we just passed the legislation that was passed in the Senate with a bipartisan majority. And I continue to believe that the ultimate solution is going to be one that comes from Congress. And although, during this political season, it may be difficult for Republican leaders in either the House or in the Senate to resuscitate that legislation, my hope is, is that after the election, they will. And in the interim, I’m going to do everything I can to sensibly apply our immigration laws in a way that is reflective of the fact that we're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.
And just very briefly, with respect to sex trafficking -- this is a critical problem. We take it very seriously. We have entire divisions in our law enforcement agencies that are dedicated to this. I’ve elevated this within the White House so that we have people focusing specifically on ending trafficking. And in our international discussions -- most specifically, out here in Southeast Asia -- we are working very closely to promote mechanisms that will end trafficking.
In fact, TPP, one of the central mechanisms in TPP, to ensure high labor standards and human rights and human dignity, are requirements among the members who are signatories to have in place real, serious, enforceable ways to prevent the kind of human trafficking that causes such hardship and brutality for so many people. 
And those of you who were with me when I visited the refugee center yesterday will recall the lovely young 16-year-old who was sitting next to me -- she’s somebody who had been a victim of trafficking. And it reminds you of the terrible toll that is often placed on children, people who are the most vulnerable, people who are least able to protect themselves. And every country has an obligation to put an end to it.

But there is a difference between being vigilant and being concerned and taking this seriously and taking precautions and, in some cases, changing our security arrangements, as we’ve done, for example, in aviation -- there’s a difference between smart applications of law enforcement and military and intelligence, and succumbing to the kind of fear that leads us to abandon our values, to abandon how we live, to abandon -- or change how we treat each other. 
And the good news is, there, Americans actually have been resilient. They’ve been tested. We had a mass casualty attack on 9/11. And as I said before, I was very proud of the fact that the fundamental nature of America and how we treated each other did not change. 
I think we made some bad decisions subsequent to that attack in part based on fear, and that's why we have to be cautious about it. We have to think things through. But overall, the American people went about their lives. Times Square is filled with people -- rightly so. After the Boston bombing attack, folks went right back to the ballpark and sang, “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” That's what they needed to do.
And so the message I have is that those of us who are charged with protecting the American people are going to do everything we can to destroy this particular network. Once this network is destroyed -- and it will be -- there may be others that pop up in different parts of the world, and so we're going to have to continue to take seriously how we maintain the infrastructure that we’ve built to prevent this. But it doesn't have to change the fundamental trajectory of the American people. And that we should feel confident about.
And the media needs to help in this. I just want to say -- during the course of this week, a very difficult week, it is understandable that this has been a primary focus. But one of the things that has to happen is how we report on this has to maintain perspective, and not empower in any way these terrorist organizations or elevate them in ways that make it easier for them to recruit or make them stronger.
They're a bunch of killers with good social media. And they are dangerous, and they’ve caused great hardship to people. But the overwhelming majority of people who go about their business every day, the Americans who are building things, and making things, and teaching, and saving lives as firefighters and as police officers -- they're stronger. Our way of life is stronger. We have more to offer -- we represent 99.9 percent of humanity. And that's why we should be confident that we’ll win.

My hope, though, is, is that now that we’ve got some time to catch our breath and take a look at this carefully, people understand that refugees who end up in the United States are the most vetted, scrutinized, thoroughly investigated individuals that ever arrive on American shores; that the process that's been constructed over the course of several administrations on a bipartisan basis is extraordinarily thorough and currently takes between 18 to 24 months for somebody to be approved. 
And so although, on its face, the House legislation simply says, well, we can just certify -- and this is not along the lines of some of the more radical proposals that we were hearing earlier in the week from some presidential candidates -- the fact of the matter is, is that if it gums up the work so much, then effectively you don’t end up seeing any refugees admitted. If you layer it with more and more bureaucracy, that doesn’t actually make us safer because it doesn’t do a better job of screening but simply makes it almost impossible to process individuals who are coming in, then you’re effectively ending the refugee program for people who desperately need it.
And when I referred to a betrayal of our values, I was being very specific about some of the commentary that was made that would suggest, for example, that we might let Christians in but not Muslims; that we -- somehow we’re so fearful that a four-year-old orphan might be let in. And those of you who joined me to the refugee center yesterday and you saw those kids, that’s who we’re talking about. If you are a parent and you saw those kids, and you thought about what they had gone through, the notion that we couldn’t find a home for them anywhere in the United States of America, that is contrary to our values.
And the good news is, is that the overwhelming majority of the people who know that we are screening and all the precautions that are already taken -- if they saw those kids, they’d say, yeah, we need to do right by those children.
So with respect to Prime Minister Najib, I don’t comment on investigations happening back in the United States; I certainly am not going to comment on any investigations or legal proceedings that may be taking place in a foreign country where I’m a visitor. But I did raise with Prime Minister Najib -- as I have with many of the leaders here in Southeast Asia, but also many leaders in Africa and Latin America and everywhere we go -- the importance of transparency, accountability, the importance of rooting out corruption -- all of which are impediments to development; all of which hold countries back; all of which contribute to poverty and stunted growth.
And if countries solve those problems, even if they are resource-poor and landlocked, they will do better. And if they don’t solve those problems, it doesn’t matter how much they’re blessed by natural resources, or size, or geography -- they’re going to fail.
And I also emphasized to Prime Minister Najib the importance of civil society and a free press in countries thriving. And every country here is at different levels and stages of development, both social and economic, and we don’t expect that everybody follows the same path that the United States does. But I do think there are some basic principles that are important for us to uphold as friends and partners to the countries that we’re talking to.
The good news is, is that -- take a country like Myanmar, that just went through a historic election after having been subject for 40 years to military rule. They’re not going to immediately be Sweden in terms of their democratic practices, but there is a sea change taking place there, and we want to encourage that and engage it. 
And a lot of the work that we do -- the Open Government Partnership that we set up through United Nations, the bilateral work we do in terms of improving transparency, the principles and rules that we’ve embedded in TPP -- all those things are designed to raise the bar, to have people set sights that are a little bit higher. And some will go forward, some will slip back. Paces will vary, but the trajectory is the same -- and that is a world where ordinary people are treated fairly, there’s rule of law, there’s transparency, governments are accountable, people’s voices are heard, women are treated equally, minorities are not discriminated against. 
Those are profoundly American values, but I also think they are universal values.
All right. Thank you, everybody. Let’s go home.
"
Rishi Sunak,"Good evening from Downing Street, where I’m joined by Steve Powis, Medical Director of the NHS and Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.
Earlier today, the government’s independent fiscal watchdog…
…the Office for Budget Responsibility, the OBR…
…published a report into the impact of coronavirus on the economy and public finances.
It’s important to be clear that the OBR’s numbers are not a forecast or prediction.
They simply set out what one possible scenario might look like – and it may not even be the most likely scenario.
But it’s important we are honest with people about what might be happening to our economy.
So before I turn to the health figures, I want to spend a few minutes explaining what the OBR have said – and let me thank them for their continued work.
There are three brief points I want to make.
First, the OBR’s figures suggest the scale of what we are facing will have serious implications for our economy here at home…
…in common with other countries around the world.
These are tough times – and there will be more to come.
As I’ve said before, we can’t protect every business and every household.
But we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British business.
So while those economic impacts are significant – the OBR also expect them to be temporary…
…with a bounce back in growth.
The second point I want to make is that we’re not just going to stand by and watch this happen.
Our planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.
Our response aims to directly support people and businesses while the restrictions are in place…
…and to make sure as restrictions are changed, we can, as quickly as possible, get people back to work; get businesses moving again; and recover our economy.
The OBR today have been clear that the policies we have set out will do that.
The OBR today have been clear that if we had not taken the actions we have, the situation would be much worse.
In other words, our plan is the right plan.
The third point I want to make is this: right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people.
It’s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health – common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating.
At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources…
…not just of the state, but of businesses, and of all of you at home as well, in a collective national effort to beat this virus.
The government’s approach is to follow scientific and medical advice through our step-by-step action plan…
…aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.
I said in my Budget a month ago that whatever the NHS needs, it will get – and we have honoured that promise:
Yesterday we published an update showing that we’ve given our public services an extra £14.5 billion in recent weeks.
We are taking action to increase NHS capacity, with more beds, more key staff and more equipment on the front-line.
And the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care will be updating on our plans for social care tomorrow.
This is why we are instructing people to stay at home, so that we can protect our NHS and save lives.
I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today:
302,599 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus, with 93,873 people testing positive
19,706 people in the UK have been admitted to hospital with the virus, down from 20,184 people yesterday;
Sadly, of those in hospital, 12,107 people have now died – an increase of 778 fatalities since yesterday.
Our thoughts are with the families and friends of all those who have lost their lives.
These figures are a powerful reminder to us all of the importance of following the government’s guidance:
Stay at home. Protect our NHS. And save lives.
Thank you.

Robert Buckland,"On 6 December 2019 Joseph McCann was given 33 life sentences at the central criminal court for a series of violent sexual attacks which he committed between 21 April and 6 May that same year. His victims, ranging from an 11-year-old boy to a 71-year-old woman, each suffered a terrifying ordeal, and I pay tribute to them for the courage they showed in giving evidence to secure McCann’s conviction. Mr Justice Edis ordered that McCann serve a minimum of 30 years before being eligible for release on parole.
When he started these attacks, McCann was being supervised on licence by the national probation service, having been released automatically from prison on 15 February, after he had served half of a three-year determinate sentence for burglary and robbery offences, less time spent on remand. However, staff in the national probation service (NPS) south-east and eastern division failed to recall McCann, both when he was remanded into custody on 21 August 2017 and when he received the new sentence on 25 January 2018. Had he been recalled, he would not have been released automatically on 15 February last year; rather, the parole board would have conducted a full risk assessment in order to determine whether it was safe re-release him on licence.
There was only a limited amount which could be shared publicly, whilst we awaited the outcome of McCann’s trial, but under ministerial direction officials re-launched the recall policy framework in early July, giving NPS divisional directors and chief executives of community rehabilitation companies personal responsibility for ensuring that their staff understood the purpose of recall and the threshold for recall. Then, in January this year, alongside the recall policy framework, new mandatory training on recall for all probation staff was launched together ​with fresh operational guidance, to support staff in the judgments they need to make when presented with evidence of an offender’s increased risk or an offender breaching licence conditions.
As a vital part of our service to victims, the NPS offers victims the opportunity to receive a copy of the SFO review, redacted only to fulfil our statutory obligations to protect the rights to privacy of third parties. After McCann had been sentenced on 6 December, NPS victim liaison officers contacted McCann’s victims and asked them whether they would like to meet an assistant chief of probation, in order to have the findings of the SFO review explained to them and to hear the action which has been taken to address the failings which the SFO review sets out. Meetings were then arranged, having regard to the victims’ preferences and availability, the first on 27 February and the final one on 5 March.
Our primary responsibility is towards the victims, which is why I have waited until they have received the full SFO review before announcing further measures.
In order to address the serious concerns which have arisen in this case and to provide wider public assurance, I have decided, exceptionally, to publish a version of the SFO review. This is not the full review, necessarily redacted, which has been shared with McCann’s victims, but it is a thorough and open account of what went wrong in this case and what has been done to put it right.
Further, so we can be absolutely sure that all the lessons of this terrible case have been learned and addressed, I have asked Her Majesty’s chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, to conduct an independent review. Justin has decided that the review will be in two parts: the first by pursuing specific lines of enquiry in relation to the management of McCann in custody and in the community and by considering whether HMPPS has taken all the organisational action necessary to improve practice in the areas in which it was found wanting, the second to take a wider look on the culture and understanding of recall in the probation service. The chief inspector has placed the terms of reference for his review here: https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprobation/about-our-work/inquiriesandreviews.
When I receive the chief inspector’s reports, I will consider whether more needs to be done to strengthen probation practice. I am determined to do all that is necessary to protect the public from known offenders. They, and McCann’s victims in particular, deserve no less.

Donald Trump,"I want to thank each of the House committee leaders for being with us today. Your devotion and leadership has been amazing. I want to just applaud you and the diligent work of your committees to advance the Obamacare repeal and replacement legislation that we've been talking about for a long time and that we've been running with, that I ran with. I can tell you -- and that's what people want. They want to repeal and replace.
The bill passed just now through Ways and Means and it will -- I think the committee just voted recently, right, your other committee, Energy and Commerce and it was a very good vote. And congratulations, it was a good job. Amazing. We must act now to save Americans from the imploding Obamacare disaster. Premiums have skyrocketed by double digits and triple digits in some cases. As an example, Arizona, which I talk about all the time, 116 percent increase and it's going up a lot higher; '17 would be a disaster for Obamacare. That's the year it was meant to explode because Obama won't be here. That was when it was supposed to be -- it will get even worse.
As bad as it is now, it'll get even worse. Choices are disappearing as one insurer drops out after another. Today, one-third of all counties now have only one insurer on the Obamacare exchanges and the exchanges themselves are a disaster. The House repeal and replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes, cutting taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars. It eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to buy government-approved plans, we all know that one.
It provides states with flexibility over how Medicaid dollars are spent, giving power from Washington and back to local government, which we all want to see. They're gonna do a much better job. And the plan empowers individual Americans to buy the health insurance that is right for them, not the plan forced on them by government. You all remember, ""You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan."" I know, Greg, you've never heard that, right?
But it was said many, many times and it turned out to be not true. This is the time we're gonna get it done. We're working together, we have some great results. We have tremendous spirit and I think it's something that's just going to happen very shortly.
So thank you all very much and we're gonna get to work. Thank you.
"
Douglas Alexander,"Conference – This has been an important debate. And it takes place after an extraordinary year for our country’s Foreign Policy.
Across the Middle East we see a region engulfed by turmoil.
In Syria a hundred thousand have been killed. Millions displaced. A nation state is melting away before our eyes.
And then last month the latest horrific chemical attack took place in Damascus
The Prime Minister announced the recall of Parliament and a Commons motion was drafted authorising British military intervention in Syria.
The UN weapons inspectors had not completed their work. The UN Secretary General was pleading for more time. And the UN Security Council was to be effectively bypassed.
Yet here the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister seemed determined to rush to military action on a timetable agreed elsewhere.
It fell to our leader, Labour’s Leader, Ed Miliband, to speak for the nation.
He upheld a basic principle: that the evidence should precede the decision, not the decision precede the evidence.
And together we set out a ‘roadmap for decision’: a clear set of tests and conditions by which our nation should reach a decision of such consequence.
Conference, it was Labour’s leadership that prevented a rush to military action on a timetable set elsewhere, without the necessary steps being taken and without due process being followed.
We have learned the lessons of the past. Intervening immediately and asking hard questions later would have ill served our country.
As Labour, we are prepared to support force where we must – as we did in Libya two years ago – but we should support diplomacy where we can.
Now, thankfully, a new diplomatic path is open to eradicate chemical weapons in Syria – in part due to Westminster’s vote.
So in the months ahead we must pursue diplomacy without illusions.
The task now is to ensure that new humanitarian efforts are made, and new diplomatic efforts are taken to get the warring parties around the table, and to end the suffering.
Now some have claimed that the Syria vote means Britain has turned its back on the world. Certainly, people across Britain are weary of conflict.
A decade of brave service by our troops in Afghanistan is drawing to a close.
And of course our economy is fragile.
But that vote told us much more about the competence of this government than it did about the character of our country.
Neither knee jerk interventionism or knee jerk isolationism is the right course for Britain in the 21st century.
It is in our national interest to upload an international rules based order.
And our country is strongest when we work with partners and allies in pursuit of shared goals.
Many on the UKIP right – whether within or out with the Conservative party – have reverted to isolationism, we know that.
So as progressive internationalists we must and will reject the isolationism that expresses itself in an anti-Europe, anti-immigrate, anti foreign aid, stop-the-world-we-want-to-get-off type of politics.
We will oppose that politics wherever we find it.
We understand that as a country we face challenges – from financial contagion to climate change to nuclear threat and conflict – that spill across borders and defy unilateral solutions.
And only a progressive internationalism can answer that call.
For Britain to now try and retreat from the world would be as foolish as it would be futile.
And that Conference is why Britain’s continued membership of the EU matters so much.
The Eurosceptic fantasy of Britain as a North Atlantic Singapore is just that – it is a fantasy.
British jobs, British exports and British influence in the world all benefit from Britain’s continued membership of the European Union.
Our economy is strengthened, our interests are advanced, and our voice is heard louder on the world stage as part of the European Union.
And that is why under Ed’s leadership, we will argue for reform in Europe, not exit from Europe.
So Conference, the real problem for the Conservatives on foreign policy isn’t the Prime Minister’s incompetence – evident though that is – it isn’t even the rise of isolationism on their backbenches – evident those that is as well.
It is that these Conservatives are in hoc to an idea – an imperial delusion – that is out of balance, and out of step, with the modern world.
They believe that as America pivots towards Asia and the Eurozone consolidates, Britain should simply focus on its own business.
They don’t understand that there is nothing splendid about isolation in the 21st century.
And they don’t understand that Britain is strongest when we work alongside our partners.
Britain stood shoulder to shoulder with our NATO allies against the Soviet Union.
Britain led the development of the single market across Europe.
Britain helped create the United Nations.
Now is the time for a new era of international cooperation.
It is time to lead reforms of Europe and its institutions.
It’s time to strengthen NATO to better coordinate our capabilities amidst tight budgets.
It’s time to deepen our partnerships with Asia, as economic power moves east.
We need that cooperation and that engagement, because “you are on your own” is as hopeless an idea in foreign policy as it is in domestic policy.
Sadly, the Conservatives just don’t get it.
They have weakened our economy at home and they have weakened our influence abroad.
This is a government that deserves to loose.
Defeating this government is our shared responsibility and working together it can be shared achievement.
"
Shailesh Vara,"Just prior to the Christmas recess, an error was identified in an online version of Form E.
This fault meant that the automatic calculator in the form calculated the wrong total for an individual’s net assets by failing to deduct certain liabilities.
However the wider implications of the faulty form were not immediately recognised.
As soon as I was made aware of this issue on 16 December, I ordered an urgent investigation.
The investigation found the faulty formula was present in versions of Form E which were online between April 2014 and mid December 2015 and between April 2011 and January 2012.
A total of 36,527 cases contain a version of Form E filed from these periods. HMCTS staff have now reviewed all these cases and found that 3,638 files – 10% – contained the faulty calculator version of Form E with an incorrect figure for net assets figure in the summary table.
1,403 of these cases are still live, allowing HMCTS to intervene immediately to clearly flag these cases to the courts in order to avoid the error affecting the final orders in these cases.
The remaining 2,235 files – 6.1% – were closed cases. Although the faulty form was used in these cases, it will not necessarily have had any effect on the ultimate outcome. Form E is only a part of the material used by the parties and the court and is used at an early stage, so the information is often disputed or superseded by further information introduced during proceedings.
Following the error coming to light, HMCTS established a dedicated email address which people could use if they were concerned about their own case: formE@hmcts.gsi.gov.uk. This email address was advertised on our website and also in all responses to media enquiries. As of 21 January, 51 members of the public have emailed us about their case.
I have instructed HMCTS to write to all parties in the 2,235 closed cases. The letter expresses our sincere regret for the error, sets out what happened and explains that, although Form E is just one part of the evidence used in their case, there remains a possibility that the error affected the final outcome.
The letter sets out options available to people involved in these cases. Some may wish to do nothing, if, for example, they know that the error was corrected during the proceedings or they do not wish to re-open their cases. If people think they have been affected by this error then they can apply to the court to vary or set aside their order. My officials consulted the President of the Family Division about the court rules and procedures that would apply to such applications or for any other proceedings that might be open to the parties. My officials also consulted the President on the development of a specific form for such applications. We have provided a link to the new form in our letter to the parties, as well as guidance on how to complete the form.
I have instructed that no court fee will be charged for making this application, and this is also made this clear in the letter from HMCTS.
We are also uploading a new version of Form E which makes clearer how the calculation of net assets should be made. We will also consider the future of Form E as part of our broader court reforms and the automatic calculator function will be disabled during this process.
This failure should not have happened. Divorce proceedings can be very difficult and I sincerely apologise for this situation and any distress it may have caused.

Donald Trump,"Isn't it over, Sam?
I have no choice. You're fired.
Do you believe this?
Can you believe what's happened?
Can you believe it?
Well, The Apprentice has just been a phenomenon. How did it come to you? Mark Burnett.
He's just a great guy. He's a great, brilliant guy.
He produced it, and he wanted me and he didn't want anyone else. And he came to me at the Wollman rink, which I control...
... and he said all the right things -- I read your book, The Art of the Deal. Donald
... we were phenomenal.
I think it's a guilty pleasure and I think it's a nervous economy. And I've been on the cover of Newsweek before
Well, I think it's something that people want. It's Survivor
They do. They do. I do fire people.
Oh, I enjoying firing people when I catch them with sticky fingers, stealing. When they're stealing my money, I fire them much more viciously than on the show. But generally speaking, I don't fire people.
Oh, I love to fire people when they cheat. Don't you? Have you...
You haven't found anybody in the cradle?
That's never happened?
No, no. But that's never happened, where people have stolen...
... from you? Not that you know of.
It's happened to you...
Larry, it's happened to you. You just don't know about it.
No, last week, you mean.
It was No. 1 on the demos -- demographic...
I do. I didn't know...
... what a demographic was. I didn't know what a demographic was, and now I find out...
... that 18 to 49 -- I like to see it succeed. I like to think -- really, I like to see anything I do succeed. I mean, I didn't know what demographics was four weeks ago. All of a sudden, I heard we were No. 3 in demographics. Last night, we were No. 1 in demographics. And that's the important rating, as you know, the 18 to 49...
And they're the people that buy things.
That means that I don't buy.
I mean, does that mean that I don't buy? I thought I was a big splurger. All of a sudden, I'm not a buyer.
I'm not a wanted person.
Right.
Nick, I don't know why you think you're such a great salesman. Your performance was terrible. Erica, you never had a strong game plan. You were frantic under pressure. And worst of all, you let your emotions dictate who came into the boardroom. Erica...
You're fired.
Well, that's why he works at Yale instead of the Wharton School of Finance, which is a much better school. Which I imagine is where you went. I never heard -- I did go there, actually. It is the best business school. But it's Harvard...
... mandatory watching at Harvard, at Wharton, at all the business schools and most of the business schools...
... perhaps not -- well, I don't think it's deceptive. I think it's life. I think it's real life. I mean, the city is a vicious place. It's a beautiful place. New York City is the toughest place in the world. It's also the most beautiful place. It's also the ugliest place. it's got every characteristic you can -- you know that.
You know it very well. But it's a tough place, and the city has eaten these kids alive. And they're geniuses, but it's just eaten them up and spit them out, and it's been tough on them. I mean, they've gone -- we have doctors. We have Harvard MBAs who are doctors simultaneously. I mean, these are brilliant kids, and they get eaten up by the city of New York. And I think that's one of the magical moments of the show, and I think that's why the show does so well.
Yes. A lot of the planning...
... is me, but it's -- a lot of it's me and it's Mark and it's Mark's staff. And I've gotten to be very good friends with Mark. And I think Mark's coming onto the program in a little...
... while. And I like his two boys even more than I like Mark. They're adorable, just like yours I just met. But a lot of it's me and -- you know, coming up with ideas, coming up with tasks. And we all get together and we come up with some things. NBC just renewed, which is not a great, you know, thing to figure out why. They just renewed for another year. And we had a one-time shot. You know, this is a one-time shot. They thought it would go on, it would be OK, and they never expected that the show would end up at No. 1 in the demographic and be such a big hit.
Well, I own 50/50 with Mark. We own the company. And we went out to bid, and every network wanted it and -- because of Mark and Mark's success with Survivor and other things You've had a better time with them than CBS, huh? Well, I never liked...
You mean calling him the most overrated man in Hollywood? I like Les Moonves. I have to tell you, I do like him. And he called me, and we are very good friends. So you know...
Hey, look, he's done a nice job and he's a good guy.
But we're very -- no, he didn't drop it. He didn't drop it. He said he dropped it after I chose another network, but he didn't drop it...
... which is one of the reasons I was a little bit upset with him. And I said to somebody, Wasn't that terrible, what he said? He said, Donald, supposing you took something away. What would you do? Would you do the same thing? I said, You know, come to think of it, I would have said the same thing as him. It's like when you got dropped by a beautiful woman, you never say you got dropped, you say...
... I left her.
Well, Mark said the most time that he'd need me was three hours a week.
Hey, look, I'm the biggest developer in New York, by far. There's nobody close. I'm building buildings all over the place. I'm building a big building in Chicago, one of the largest buildings built in Chicago -- the largest building since the Sears tower. In Los Angeles now, I'm doing a big development in Palace Verdes, big golf course...
... which will put -- hopefully, put Pebble Beach to shame. I mean, it'll be better than -- it's two miles along the Pacific Ocean, 300 acres. It's going to be amazing, with 75 -- I'm doing stuff all over the place. I don't have time for this.
Yes. Except it took 30 hours, OK, not 3 hours.
Yes. Mark totally misrepresented to me, OK.
I have to talk to him.
Well, now we really have a system where I go into the boardroom, I rant and rave like a lunatic to these kids, and I leave and I go off and build my buildings. And then it gets good ratings, and they pay me. I mean, can you believe this?
Versicore went to the boardroom, where tensions flared between Bill and the women.
Katrina doesn't think you did a great job negotiating.
And Tammy was questioned about her loyalty. Why did you say we were duped? What do you think? Was she honest, or was she disloyal?
Tammy, the disloyalty has been so obnoxious in this particular case that I have to say you're fired.
You're not going to believe this. The men are at that smelly Fulton Fish Market, trying to sell lemonade. It's a terrible location, and there's nobody here.
Women? I mean, do women use sex? Absolutely not. You've never known a woman to use sex, right? On my show, I get criticized when they use sex. The rest of the world, nobody gets criticized. You know, amazingly, these people were chosen. They're young people, and they were chosen for their brain, but they happen to be attractive. I mean, the women, some of the women, happen to be very attractive. And they have used their sexuality to win certain tasks, as we call them. And hey, that's part of life, I guess. In real life, that happens, too. I've known it. I've seen it happen. It's actually happened to me a couple of times, Larry.
It's happened to you many times.
Well, it's an instinct. I watch what happens. I have two very smart people, George Ross and Carolyn Capture, that work for me. And they are -- they really are smart and very aware. And they go and they follow these people doing the task, and they come back and report back, and that has a big impact on me. And at the end of the whole event, I sit down in the boardroom, we discuss it, and I fire the person that I think has not done the job.
Very carefully. No, no. We don't play games. This is a very serious thing. And you know, it's being imitated by so many people now. I see ESPN is having something...
... for an announcer...
... and Matt Lauer and Katie were -- yes, I guess that's happened to you, too, actually, hasn't it, when you think of it.
. What happened to Larry? But it happens, and I guess that's, you know, a form of flattery. But it really is happening a lot.
The winner works for me on a large salary for a period of one year, and at the end of the year, if I like that person and if that person likes me, they'll stay, or they'll go out and become a billionaire or a millionaire or whatever they're going to become.
An entrepreneur. And actually, if the winner is the right person, probably they wouldn't want to stay beyond a year. They want to learn whatever they have to learn, and then they want to go out and do their thing and...
It depends on who it is. Really, it depends on who it is. I mean, of the 16 people, literally all 16 I could hire and do very well with. They're really...
Oh, no. There's nobody bad. I mean, you take somebody like Sam -- Sam is a really smart guy. He's a character and, honestly, great television and all that, but he's a really smart guy. And you could make a lot of money with a guy like Sam.
Yes, but different places. I mean, for Sam I'd do something. For somebody else -- Amy, let's say, or this one or that one -- you put them in different places.
I think business is held in low esteem, but I've known so many businesses that are some of the finest people you'll ever meet. And they're very tough, very smart...
... businessmen.
It's very bad. And it's -- you know, it's a shame. And you see what's going on in the world today, with all of the indictments of now, finally, the Enron people, and they were bad news.
I mean, there's no question about it. And there was so much thievery. And those are the ones that get all the ink.
It's not all of the good ones that have done a great job over many years. So it's a little bit tough. That's one of the things we were worried about with the show because this a very business-oriented show in Manhattan. And we were a little bit worried, Does this rub off, and do people say, He we don't want to watch this kind of a thing? And interestingly, they said women wouldn't watch the show at the beginning. The critics said, Well, women won't watch the show. And women are the No. 1 watcher of the show, by far.
Well, I don't know. They said they wouldn't watch it because of me, because, you know, I'm a person...
... that likes women, so therefore, because I like women, women aren't going to watch. And it's just turned out to be the opposite. I mean, our No. 1 viewer is women, and I think that's a very important element. You have to have...
... women.
Well, I -- she's a friend of mine.
I am devastated that Martha didn't testify! I would have said testify. Now, I might be wrong, and if she's exonerated, I'll say, OK, I'm wrong. But I think this jury...
Well, not the public, the jury. Right now, it doesn't matter what the public thinks. It matters what that jury thinks.
And I think that jury of 12 people is saying, like, Tell us you didn't do it. Don't -- we don't want to hear from all the secretaries and everything else, many of whom were nullified and badly nullified. You got to get up on the stand! And I know it's tough. Hey, it's tough coming on the show with you. Who the hell wants to do this in front of potentially millions of people?
But really. You know, you get -- you do it. It's life, and you have to do it. She has to get up on the stand and she has to say, I didn't do it. I'm innocent. But you know, when she said and her lawyer said Martha Stewart is not going to testify, the whole jury went like this, as I read, and rightfully so. She -- I wish I could have been there. I would have insisted that she testify. In all cases, no. Hey, I know Mike Tyson very well, and Mike Tyson was going to be innocent, and then he testified. It was a disaster. His testimony...
No, no. You got to know who you're dealing with. Mike was a disaster. Mike was found guilty. The jury came out and said if he didn't testify, he would have been OK.
But when he testified -- but Martha should have testified!
I know Mike very well.
I feel -- I think it's terrible. I think it's terrible. But you know, I paid Mike a lot of money for a fight, and they never found the check. I gave him a check for a lot of money when he was really hot... I gave it to him. I thought it'd be a nice thing. So I handed him a check for millions of dollars. And like, about a month and a half later, my accountant came and said, Mr. Trump, that check never was cashed. They never found it. I said, That's OK...
It's time for Michael Eisner to get out. It really is. I mean, he's been...
... there for a long time.
No, it's time for him to get out. It's enough already. It's time to get out. And that's not so bad. He's been there a long time. But you know, it's time.
It's always time. There's going to be a time when you're going to have to get out, Larry.
You're not thinking...
There'll be a time. There'll be a time. I mean, there's always a time. Maybe...
People are just not happy with the job he's done, and the shareholders aren't happy and the stock price -- I mean, it's only high because somebody's trying to take over the company. But it really seems to be time for -- I like Michael. I know Michael. It's time. There's nothing wrong with that.
As you both know, we have an elevator that goes up to the suite and an elevator that goes down to the street. One of you will stay and one of you will be sent home. And David, I'm going to ask to you take the down elevator. You're fired.
No. It's what I do.
I do like them, but it's what I do, and I have to do. And you know, it was never meant to be, the word you're fired. This was going to...
Oh, forget it. It's become -- They have T-shirts all over the universe.
I did, actually. I did.
Mark and I...
I'm going to try. I don't know. How do you patent the words You're fired?
But we're going to try.
Hello.
Good. Thank you.
Well, the second question, no. It's in the hands of a man named Larry Silverstein, who's a friend of mine, who's a great developer in New York and a really good guy. And I hate the design, and I don't think Larry likes the design. It was foisted upon him. It's a 50-story building that looks like it's 120 stories. It's a skeleton. And that's the last thing we need in New York is a skeleton of -- representing the World Trade Center. I think that it is not an appropriate design. I don't like it. But Larry's a good developer. He'll get it built, I think. And it's tough. You know, it depends on the market. The market in New York is not particularly...
I'm the...
Absolutely. I don't really consult with anybody. I talk to people, but I'm absolutely the final decision.
I was home watching a certain show, where Jack Welch, who's a great guy, was being interviewed. And they interrupted the program to say that this had happened. It was, you know, 8:45 or so in the morning, and I was listening to Jack, who I love.
I think he's a great guy. And I'm saying, What's this? And they showed a picture of the World Trade Center with this incredible flame pouring out of the side. And you know, you knew it couldn't be a boiler.
That's down in the basement. You know, you're saying, What is this? What could be possibly this? And of course, as the second plane hit, which I witnessed because the building I was in was very high and looked directly at the World Trade Center, you said, Well, now you know what it is. But what a terrible, terrible period of time that was. Ever.
Never, never in history has there been anything like this. Pearl Harbor was bad, but at least that was soldiers and sailors. These were innocent people.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much. Yes, Mark Burnett is thinking about it and...
A book about it. I'm doing a book, a separate book. I'm doing a book How to Get Rich with Random House and...
I got -- no, much more than that, over $5 million.
Yes, but I don't want to talk about it. You know why? Because Oprah will be angry at me. I happen to love Oprah, and I'm doing -- I'm giving Oprah the exclusive on the book. I gave her the exclusive...
Yes, as soon as it comes out, which is in about two weeks.
No, it's about two weeks. Yes, over $5 million advance.
It's called How to Get Rich -- Trump: How to Get Rich. And you know
Yes.
Well, first of all, you know what the losers get, right? They get three years.
If they get fired, if I think they're bad and if they're just not doing it, I'll let them know and they still get paid.
I guess you have visions of something big, something glamorous, but that's not going to be it. We're bringing you back to basics. You're going to go outside and you're going to sell lemonade.
It's been fun.
It was a good task. I didn't agree with that task. Mark liked that one. I didn't like it as much. Mark's reasoning was good and it really proved out to be right. The first thing we all do is sell lemonade. We're 4, 5 years old, we go in front of the house and we sell lemonade. So, I'm at the New York Stock Exchange with all the killers on the floor screaming, Donald! Donald! And the bell is going off and we're telling these kids to go out and sell lemonade on Wall Street.
But it was good.
Well, could you see there was a tremendous undercurrent and by the way, there still is. People don't like her. The women in particular just did not like her. And she is a smart, tough, cunning woman, but boy, you talk about an undercurrent, that is a big undercurrent.
There is Trump Ice. KING; Now, what is that? Water, right? You can get it by calling 212-832-2000 and just order as much as you want and they send it to you.
KING; Trump Ice. Trump Ice. It's water. It's spring water. It's great spring water. It looks great.
Oh, it's a legit product. 212-832-2000 and just order as much as you want.
Well, Mark...
We had 215,000 people apply for the job. Now, I have to tell you, that was the first indication we got that the show was going to be a monster hit.
More than anybody has applied in the history of television for a show, 215,000 and out of that, they took 16. Now, I have to tell you just to go into this for the new show, they actually put on an ad for television which you probably saw during the apprentice. We have over 500,000 applicants for the new show, because we're doing an Apprentice 2.
That starts shooting a couple of months. It's going to be on in the fall. And it'll be terrific.
April 15, tax day. That's going to be live from New York City. If you'd like to do that show I'd love to give it to you. You should do it rather than me.
Live television for two hours choosing the winner. It's going to get big ratings. What can I tell you. They tell me that does even better than a nonlive show. Would you say that's right?
You think so?
That's true.
That's right.
Mark and the staff chooses with me but I'm doing other things, chose out of the 215,000 the 16 people. Once the 16 people were in my board room, it was my decision. In all fairness to Mark, he wanted it to be my decision. He never once came to me and said, you know, this one's great for showbiz. This is great for ratings. You got to keep this one or that one. And he is a very legitimate guy, Mark. He is a great guy.
Well you know, it's interesting. Certainly wasn't for the money and most people tell me don't do it, because 95 percent of the shows that go on television fail. So by all standards it should have been a failure.
I don't want to be associated with failures. I don't have failures. I like to have success, not failures. So, a lot of people that are with me say, don't do it because statistically it's going to fail. Well, it turned out to be that it didn't. Now what happened is the second show is a very profitable, for Mark and myself, because of the fact that we hit so big on the first one and obviously NBC wanted to do a second one. And they're doing a second one, and it's going to be -- I can't say bigger and better.
Fun. Hey, I'm building buildings all over the place. Let's do something different. It's fun. I'm having fun doing it.
Well, I didn't consider it long. I had a group. They did a poll and the poll came -- I did a favor for a trend friend of mine in New Hampshire. He went to the Wharton School of Finance. He said, Donald, would you come up and make a speech to a business group. I came up to New Hampshire as a favor to him. I made a speech. And everyone thought I was running for president.
No I kept it going for about two weeks. But I wasn't running. I love what I'm doing.
I think it's going to be very close. I think it's going to be John Kerry against Bush. I know them both. They're both good guys and I think will be a close race.
You know I know him very well.
He lives in my buildings, more than one. He lives in various of my buildings. I mean, he sort of follows me around in the sense of he likes what I have.
He's been great. He's never been a problem. I hear all of the horror stories. He's never been a problem. And I would know, believe me. I ask the doormen, I ask the concierge, I ask the elevator operators. Michael Jackson has never been a problem, but it's too bad. It's very sad.
It has been asked but, basically it's purely on the task. But I'll go a step further, that task, it may be how they've done over the preceding weeks, that certainly enters into the equation also but has nothing to do with the entertainment value.
Come on, let's go.
Would you please inform the public.
Don't mess it up too much.
It's really not that much of a comb over. I get killed in this hair. I'm getting killed...
You know the show has gotten great reviews. I've gotten great reviews, everything gotten great reviews, except for one thing, my hair, gets bad reviews.
It's a mess.
You know what I do. I take a shower, I wash it, I then comb it and set it and I spray it and it's good for the day, but I'm getting killed on my hair.
Well, if I did I think Mark wouldn't let me because the ratings would probably go way down. Do you agree with that Mark? The ratings would go down and he'd say please go back to your old hair style.
I don't care. It's not a big deal. But I don't think so. It's worked.
Yes. I don't feel it's even different. It's been the way I've always combed it.
It can't be good. It's certainly not my strength.
Thank you.
Well, first of all, I know the Hilton sisters and they're good kids. I think they're getting a bum wrap. She was with this one dog named Solomon, and I'd like to represent them against him. I would like to really sue his ass off and they're such nice people. I haven't even sued him yet. I was with them the other night and they're holding for me a party for me tomorrow night at Baron Hilton's house.
And you're going. And everybody in Hollywood is going. And they're going because of The Apprentice
And they're nice girl, the Hilton girls are nice girls. And my family is terrific. I mean, they really are. Now, they're highly educated. My family is highly educated. I'm highly educated, which until The Apprentice most people didn't know. They thought I was a barbarian. But I'm highly educated.
I think I worked at it. I think I worked at it. I was tough. I was firm with them. I didn't give them too much money. But you know, when they walk in and their boyfriend comes over to Marolagro, and that's the lobby of their, you know, let's pick up Ivanka for a date, and they walk into Marolagro, it's a little bit different. But you know, she's a very well-grounded girl, and all the other kids are great.
. It looks more like formica.
No, I've never had a problem with my kids.
I don't like that. I don't like that deal, unless the cash they're putting down is worth more than the whole company anyway and it's just a shot in the dark to get the rest. Otherwise, I wouldn't make that kind of a deal.
It's true. Thank you.
Right. They spend about three months doing the show. And again, the winner has not been picked. There have been numerous episodes that have been picked, but the winner has not been picked. That's going to be live.
Because we just can't take a chance on somebody finding out, and it's more exciting. The age limit, generally speaking, is going to be younger people, because these are people...
... that are apprentices, but not only that; these are supposed to be people with potential.
But if a guy hasn't made it by the time he's 50, guess what? I don't want him to be my apprentice.
Hey, Sam...
I hear you're in charge.
Well, we're going to see, because the men are taking a big beating. Are you going to turn it around?
I never knew you were so short. Come here.
I want to shake your hand.
Come here. Give me your hand. How is he doing fellow, all right?
Do you think they maybe made you the team leader to get rid of you?
Well, you know how that doesn't happen, if you win? Good luck.
What makes you think you have charisma?
More so than the other three?
Who do you think, Nick, did the worst job?
Whatever he wants to do.
That's true.
He's a great conceptualizer. He knows what people want. He's doing the show The Contender. I never spoke to him I mean, he's just a great conceptualizer. And I'll tell you something else, and I say it in a very positive way, he's an amazing salesman. I told you before, he said, Donald, you've got to do it, Mr. Trump, you've got to do it. It will take you three hours a week and maybe less. You know, 37 hours later I'm saying what the hell happened to the three hours? He's an unbelievable salesman. But beyond the salesman stuff, because, you know, salesmen are salesmen. He's a brilliant guy, a great producer and just got it.
He's good. He's good. He's going to go on, and I'm going to go back to building buildings, which I really look forward to.
I'm building actually the largest building in the Midwest since the Sears Tower, 2.7 million square feet at the Sun-Times site on the river. It's going to be mostly apartments and hotels and it's going to be, we already sold $40 million of apartments and we haven't started building the building.
No, I don't. I live in Los Angeles. I stay in the Trump building when I was in New York.
You know, Larry. When you're with Trump you can only stay in Trump buildings.
I'm going to make a decision on probably during the month of February, and that will be based on whether or not I think I can win. I'm not looking to get 20 percent of the vote. If I think I can win, we may very well have a very positive decision.
Have you ever met anybody -- so do you, by the way. A lot of times you try to hide it. But you have a big ego. I know you very well. Have you ever met a successful person...
Have you ever met a successful person without a big ego? Not recently.
Always my father. I mean I had a wonderful father, he's a builder in Brooklyn, in Queens. He built moderate income housing and he was just a great guy and I learned a lot from him and he was a great guy. He was my best friend.
Let her go on. That sounds very...
I try and tell myself it doesn't matter. Nothing matters. If you tell yourself it doesn't matter, like you do shows, you do this, you do that and then you have earthquakes in India where 400,000 people get killed. Honestly, it doesn't matter. That's how I handle stress.
"
Donald Trump,"One hundred days ago, I took the oath of office and made a pledge: We are not merely going to transfer political power from one party to another, but instead are going to transfer that power from Washington, D.C., and give it back to the people.
In the past 100 days, I have kept that promise -- and more.
Issue by issue, department by department, we are giving the people their country back. After decades of a shrinking middle class, open borders and the mass offshoring of American jobs and wealth, this government is working for the citizens of our country and no one else.
We have opened the White House doors to listen, engage and act. We've invited in labor leaders, factory owners, police officers, farmers, veterans and Democrats, Republicans and independents.
The change began with the termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a 12-nation pact that would have shipped millions more jobs to other countries.
But leaving the TPP was only the beginning. We have also launched an investigation into foreign trading abuses and taken steps to protect the production of American steel and aluminum. After years of federal contracts going to foreign bidders, we are ensuring that government agencies enforce ""Buy American"" rules and give preference to American companies -- and that American companies hire American workers.
Crucially, to bring back our jobs, we are going to pursue a complete renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement: We've lost nearly a third of our manufacturing jobs in the 23 years since that terrible deal was approved.
At the center of our economic agenda, we've undertaken the most far-reaching effort in history to remove job-killing regulations. I've ordered that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We've signed a record 13 Congressional Review Act resolutions to scrap job-crushing regulations, and I've signed 29 pieces of legislation in total -- a mark not surpassed in the first 100 days since Harry S. Truman.
Those newly enacted laws include Veterans' Choice legislation -- which became law while at the same time we've increased by 42 percent the number of veterans approved to see the doctor of their choosing. And we've provided transparency by publishing all wait times at the Veterans Affairs health system online, backed up by a new Veterans Affairs Office of Accountability.
On energy, the change has been profound. We've canceled restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas and clean coal.
What we've accomplished on immigration and criminal enforcement is nothing short of historic. After decades of unending illegal immigration and mass uncontrolled entry, we've turned the tide as never before -- illegal border-crossings are down 73 percent. Visa processes are being reformed to substantially improve vetting and screening, and we've launched prototypes and bidding for the border wall to stop the scourge of drugs, human trafficking and illegal immigrants from coming into our country.
Federal law enforcement has begun a crackdown on sanctuary cities that harbor criminal aliens -- because we know the first duty of government is to protect American citizens.
The Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the director of national intelligence, have formed an inter-agency group for the express purpose of dismantling transnational criminal cartels. The handcuffs have been removed from our prosecutors, and they're targeting the drug dealers and gang members who prey on our citizens -- and they're working to eradicate the violent cartel MS-13.
The change on defense has been profound as well. The Defense Department has begun to rebuild and restore our military readiness. We've reasserted American leadership by holding the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria accountable for its monstrous use of banned chemical weapons against helpless, innocent civilians. Our successful missile strike enforced the red line that the previous administration drew but ignored, thus restoring our credibility with our friends and our deterrence with our foes. Finally, NATO countries are starting to pay billions of dollars more since I have made clear that the United States expects all of its allies to pay their fair share.
I delivered on one of my biggest promises, appointing and confirming a new justice to the Supreme Court who will be faithful to the U.S. Constitution. This is the first time a new justice has been confirmed in the first 100 days in 136 years.
As we've made these changes -- on the border, on our economy, on our security -- confidence has soared. And a survey of manufacturing reveals record-breaking optimism in the future. Consumer confidence hit a 16-year high. Thousands of new jobs are being re-shored back to America -- including jobs at Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Sprint, Intel and so many more.
We are proving that Buy and Hire American isn't just a slogan -- it's now the policy of the U.S. government. It, along with the many other things we are doing, will Make America Great Again.
No longer will we listen to the same failed voices of the past who brought us nothing but war overseas, poverty at home and the loss of companies, jobs and our wealth to countries that have taken total advantage of the United States.
The White House is once again the People's House. And I will do everything in my power to be the People's President -- to faithfully, loyally and proudly champion the incredible citizens who love this nation and who call this God-blessed land their home.
"
Jeremy Corbyn,"Thank you for that introduction. And how brilliant it is to see the hall here in Liverpool, absolutely packed for the Labour conference, well I say it’s packed but Virgin Trains assure me there are 800 empty seats.
Either way Conference, it’s a huge pleasure to be holding our party’s annual gathering here in this fantastic city that has shaped our country, our economy, our culture and our music.
Liverpool and its people have always been central to the Labour party and our movement. And I know some people say campaigns and protests don’t change things. But the Hillsborough families have shown just how wrong that is.
It’s taken twenty-seven years but those families have, with great courage and dignity, finally got some truth and justice for the ninety-six who died. And I want to pay tribute to all the families and campaigners, for their solidarity, their commitment and their love.
We must learn from them so we promise those campaigning for Orgreave, for Shrewsbury, for the thousands of workers blacklisted for being trade unionists that we will support your battles for truth and justice and when we return to government we will make sure that you have both.
Because winning justice for all and changing society for the benefit of all is at the heart of what Labour is about.
So yes, our party is about campaigning and it’s about protest too.
But most of all it’s about winning power in local and national government, to deliver the real change our country so desperately needs.
That’s why the central task of the whole Labour party, must be to rebuild trust and support to win the next general election and form the next government. That is the government I am determined to lead, to win power to change Britain for the benefit of working people.
But every one of us in this hall today knows that we will only get there if we work together. And I think it’s fair to say after what we’ve been through these past few months that hasn’t always been exactly the case.
Those months have been a testing time for the whole party, first the horrific murder of Jo Cox, followed by the shock of the referendum result and then the tipping over of divisions in parliament, into the leadership contest that ended last Saturday.
Jo’s killing was a hate-filled attack on democracy itself that shocked the whole country. Jo Cox didn’t just believe in loving her neighbor, she believed in loving her neighbour’s neighbor, that every life counted the same.
And as Jo said in her maiden speech as an MP “we have far more in common with each other than things that divide us”. Let that essential truth guide us as we come together again to challenge this Tory Government and its shaky grip on power.
We have also lost good MPs like Michael Meacher and Harry Harpham. They were Labour through and through, passionate campaigners for a better world.
And let me pay particular tribute to those parliamentary colleagues who stepped forward in the summer to fill the gaps in the shadow cabinet and ensure that Labour could function as an effective opposition in parliament.
They didn’t seek office, but they stepped up when their party and in fact the country needed them to serve. They all deserve the respect and gratitude of our party and movement. And this conference should thank them today, they are our future.
We’ve just had our second leadership election within a year. It had its fraught moments of course, not only for Owen Smith and me , and I hope we don’t make a habit of it.
But there have also been upsides. Over 150,000 new members joined our party. Young rising stars have shone on the front bench and we found that the party is more united on policy than we would ever have guessed.
I am honoured to have been re-elected by our party a second time with an even larger mandate. But we all have lessons to learn and a responsibility to do things better and work together more effectively. I will lead in learning those lessons and I’d like to thank Owen, for the campaign and his work as shadow work and pensions secretary.
And all the Labour Party Staff and my own team for their brilliant work.
One lesson is, that there is a responsibility on all of us to take care with our rhetoric, respect democratic decisions, respect our differences and respect each other. We know that robust debate has at times spilled over into abuse and hate around our party, including misogyny and anti-Semitism, especially on social media.
That is utterly unacceptable. Our party must be a safe and welcoming space for everybody and we will continue to take firm action against abuse and intimidation.
And let me be absolutely clear, anti-Semitism is an evil, it led to the worst crimes of the 20th century, every one of us has a responsibility to ensure that it is never allowed to fester in our society again. This party always has and always will fight against prejudice and hatred of Jewish people with every breath in its body.
We meet this year as the largest political party in western Europe with over half a million members campaigning in every community in Britain.
More people have joined our party in the last twenty months than in the previous twenty years. We have more of our fellow citizens in our party than all the others put together.
Some may see that as a threat. But I see it as a vast democratic resource. Our hugely increased membership is part of a movement that can take Labour’s message into every community, to win support for the election of a Labour government. Each and every one of these new members is welcome in our party.
And after a ten year absence, we welcome back the Fire Brigades Union to our party and to conference. We are reuniting the Labour family.
And over the past year, we’ve shown what Labour can do when the party stands together.
At conference a year ago, I launched our campaign against cuts to tax credits and we succeeded in knocking this government back.
This year, three million families are over £1,000 better off because Labour stood together.
In the Budget, the government tried to take away billions from disabled people but we defeated them …
We have won all four by-elections we’ve contested. In the May elections, we overtook the Tories to become the largest party nationally. We won back London with a massive win for Sadiq Khan the first Muslim mayor of a western capital city.
And we won the Bristol mayor for the first time, Marvin Rees, the first black mayor in any European city. And of course we also won the mayoralty in Salford and here in Liverpool.
That’s the road of advance we have to return to if we’re going to challenge the Tories for power and turn the huge growth in the Labour party into the electoral support we need across Britain.
There’s no doubt my election as Labour leader a year ago. And re-election this month grew out of a thirst for a new kind of politics, and a conviction that the old way of running the economy and the country, isn’t delivering for more and more people.
It’s not about me of course, or unique to Britain but across Europe, North America and elsewhere, people are fed up with a so-called free market system, that has produced grotesque inequality stagnating living standards for the many calamitous foreign wars without end and a political stitch-up which leaves the vast majority of people shut out of power.
Since the crash of 2008, the demand for an alternative and an end to counter-productive austerity has led to the rise of new movements and parties in one country after another.
In Britain it’s happened in the heart of traditional politics, in the Labour party which is something we should be extremely proud of. It’s exactly what Labour was founded for to be the voice of the many of social justice and progressive change from the bottom up.
But it also means it’s no good harking back to the tired old economic and political fixes of twenty years ago because they won’t work anymore. The old model is broken. We’re in a new era that demands a politics and economics that meets the needs of our own time.
Even Theresa May gets it, that people want change. That’s why she stood on the steps of Downing Street and talked about the inequalities and burning injustices in today’s Britain.
She promised a country: “that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us”.
But even if she manages to talk the talk, she can’t walk the walk.
This isn’t a new government, it’s David Cameron’s government repackaged with progressive slogans but with a new harsh rightwing edge, taking the country backwards and dithering before the historic challenges of Brexit.
Who seriously believes that the Tories could ever stand up to the privileged few? They are the party of the privileged few, funded by the privileged few, for the benefit of the privileged few.
This is a party, after all that now wants to force through an undemocratic Boundary Review based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register with nearly two million voters missing.
They’ve dressed up as a bid to cut the cost of politics by abolishing fifty MPs, but the £12million savings are dwarfed by the expense of the 260 peers David Cameron appointed at a cost of £34million a year. It’s nothing but a cynical attempt to gerrymander the next election.
And this is a prime minister who was elevated to her job without a single vote being cast after a pantomime farce which saw one leading Tory after another falling on their swords.
When I meet Theresa May across the dispatch box, I know that only one of us has been elected to the office they hold, by the votes of a third of a million people.
In any case, the Tories are simply incapable of responding to the breakdown of the old economic model. Because that failed model is in their political DNA.
It’s what they deliver every time they’re in government. Tory governments deregulate, they outsource and privatise they stand by as inequality grows.
They’ve cut taxes for the privileged few sold off our national assets to them, always on the cheap and turned a blind eye to their chronic tax avoidance.
They’re so committed to the interests of the very richest they recruited Sir Phillip Green into government as something called an efficiency tsar.
Well, government might be a bit more efficient if the super-rich like Sir Phillip actually paid their taxes.
When government steps back there are consequences for every one of us.
Look what’s happened to housing under the Tories:
housebuilding has fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s;
home ownership is falling as more people are priced out of the market;
evictions and homelessness go up every year;
council homes are sold off without being replaced.
And another consequence is that we’re paying over £9 billion a year to private landlords in housing benefit.
Instead of spending public money on building council housing, we’re subsidising private landlords. That’s wasteful, inefficient, and poor government.
So Labour will, as Teresa Pearce said, build over a million new homes at least half of them council houses and we will control private rents, so we can give every British family that basic human right – a decent home.
It’s the same in the jobs market. Without proper employment regulation, there’s been an explosion of temporary, insecure jobs nearly one million people on zero hour contracts.
There are now six million working people earning less than the living wage and poverty among those in work is at record levels.
That didn’t happen by accident, the Tories have torn up employment rights and deliberately tried to weaken the organisations that get people justice at work the trade unions.
Of course trade unions are not taking this lying down. Look at the great campaign Unite has waged at Sports Direct, to get justice for exploited workers and hold Mike Ashley to account. That is why Labour will repeal the Trade Union Act and set unions free to do their job.
And we will raise the minimum wage to a real living wage that brings working people out of poverty and we’ll ban zero hours contracts as John McDonnell and Ian Lavery have set out at this conference.
And then there’s the scandal of the privatised railways more public subsidy than under the days of British Rail all going to private firms and more delays more cancellations. And the highest fares in Europe.
That is why the great majority of the British people back Labour’s plan, set out by Andy MacDonald, to take the railways back into public ownership.
But if you want the most spectacular example of what happens, when government steps back, the global banking crash is an object lesson a deregulated industry of out of control greed and speculation that crashed economies across the globe and required the biggest ever government intervention and public bailout in history.
Millions of ordinary families paid the price for that failure. I pledge that Labour will never let a few reckless bankers wreck our economy again.
So Labour is offering solutions. During this summer’s leadership campaign, I set out ten pledges which I believe can be the platform for our party’s programme at the next election.
They have now been put to you and endorsed by this conference.
They lay out the scope of the change we need to see for full employment, a homes guarantee, security at work, a strong public NHS and social care, a National Education Service for all, action on climate change, public ownership and control of our services, a cut in inequality of income and wealth action to secure an equal society and peace and justice at the heart of foreign policy.
Don’t worry, they’re not the Ten Commandments. They will now go to the National Policy Forum and the whole party needs to build on them, refine them and above all take them out to the people of this country.
But those ten pledges the core of the platform on which I was re-elected leader will now form the framework for what Labour will campaign for and for what a Labour government will do.
Together they show the direction of change we are determined to take – and the outline of a programme to rebuild and transform Britain.
They are rooted in traditional Labour values and objectives shaped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. They are values Labour is united on. They reflect the views and aspirations of the majority of our people. And they are values our country can and will support as soon as they are given the chance.
And these pledges are not just words. Already, across the country, Labour councils are putting Labour values into action, in a way that makes a real difference to millions of people, despite cynical government funding cuts that have hit Labour councils five times as hard as Tory-run areas.
Like Nottingham City Council setting up the not-for-profit Robin Hood Energy company to provide affordable energy;
Or Cardiff Bus Company taking 100,000 passengers every day, publicly owned with a passenger panel to hold its directors to account;
Or Preston Council working to favour local procurement, and keep money in the town;
Or Newcastle Council providing free wi-fi in 69 public buildings across the city;
Or Croydon Council which has set up a company to build 1,000 new homes, as Cllr Alison Butler said: “We can no longer afford to sit back and let the market take its course”.
Or Glasgow that has established high quality and flexible workspaces for start-up, high growth companies in dynamic new sectors.
Or here in Liverpool, set to be at the global forefront of a new wave of technology and home to Sensor City, a £15million business hub that aims to create 300 start-up businesses and 1,000 jobs over the next decade.
It is a proud Labour record each and every Labour councilor deserves our heartfelt thanks for the work they do.
But I want to go further because we want local government to go further and put public enterprise back into the heart of our economy and services to meet the needs of local communities, municipal socialism for the 21st century, as an engine of local growth and development.
So today I’m announcing that Labour will remove the artificial local borrowing cap and allow councils to borrow against their housing stock.
That single measure alone would allow them to build an extra 12,000 council homes a year.
Labour councils increasingly have a policy of in-house as the preferred provider and many councils have brought bin collections, cleaners, and IT services back in-house, insourcing privatized contracts to save money for council tax payers and to ensure good terms and conditions for staff.
I have said that Labour will put security at work and employment and union rights from day one centre stage.
But one in six workers now in Britain are now self-employed. They’re right to value their independence but for too many it comes with insecurity and a woeful lack of rights.
So we will review arrangements for self-employed people including social security that self-employed people pay for in their taxes, yet aren’t fully covered by.
And we will ensure that successful innovators have access to the finance necessary to take their ideas to the next level grow their businesses and generate employment.
So as part of our Workplace 2020 review, we will make sure that and our tax and social security arrangements are fit for the 21st century, consulting with self-employed workers and the Federation of Small Businesses.
If the Tories are the party of cuts and short-termism. Labour is the Party of investing for the future.
With the same level of investment as other major economies, we could be so much more unlock so much skill, ingenuity and wealth.
That’s why we’ll establish a National Investment Bank at the heart of our plan to rebuild and transform Britain.
And we will borrow to invest at historically low interest rates, to generate far greater returns. It would be foolish not to, because that investment is expanding the economy and the income it generates for us all in the process.
Even this government, after years of austerity and savage cuts to investment is starting to change its tune.
I am not content with accepting second-class broadband, not content with creaking railways, not content with seeing the US and Germany investing in cutting edge and green technologies, while Britain lags behind.
Last year, for example the Prime Minister promised a universal service obligation for ten megabyte broadband.
But since then the government has done nothing letting down entrepreneurs, businesses and families, especially in rural areas.
That’s why we’ve set out proposals for a National Investment Bank with £500 billion of investment to bring our broadband, our railways, our housing and our energy infrastructure up to scratch.
A country that doesn’t invest is a country that has given up. That has taken the path of managed decline. A Labour government will never accept second best for Britain.
Our country’s history is based on individual ingenuity and collective endeavor.
We are the country of Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Tim Berners-Lee, the land of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Sarah Guppy of George Stephenson and Eric Laithwaite.
The Tories have turned their back on this proud British tradition. They have put privatisation and cutting spending first.
Britain now spends less on research as a share of national income than France, Germany, the US and China. A Labour Government will bring research and development up to three percent of GDP.
Yesterday, Rebecca Long Bailey set out the terms of our Industrial Strategy Review. We need an economy that works for every part of this country so that no community is left behind.
And today I’m asking everyone, businesses, academics, workers, trade unions and anyone who cares about our future prosperity to have your say in that review.
We are a wealthy country – and not just in terms of money.
We are rich in talent, rich in potential.
That’s why we’ve proposed a comprehensive National Education Service at the heart of our programme for government to deliver high quality education for all throughout our lives.
Education has always been a core Labour value from the time of Ellen Wilkinson and before.
And a National Education Service will be an essential part of the 21st century welfare state.
In a rapidly changing economy people need to re-train or upgrade their skills without falling into debt.
Britain already lags behind other in productivity.
Partly that’s about investing in technology and infrastructure.
And partly it’s about investing in people and their skills.
How can we build and expand the sectors of the future without a skilled workforce?
But this Conservative government has slashed adult education budgets taking away opportunities for people to develop their skills and leaving businesses struggling to find the skilled workforce they need to succeed.
So today I am offering business a new settlement. A new deal for Rebuilding Britain.
Under Labour we will provide the investment to rebuild Britain’s infrastructure.
We will fund that investment because it will lead to a more productive economy providing the basis on which our economy and our businesses can thrive, helping to provide over a million good jobs and opportunities for businesses.
But investment in capital must include investment in human capital, the skilled workers needed to make our economy a success.
So this is the deal Labour will offer to business.
To help pay for a National Education Service, we will ask you pay a little more in tax.
We’ve already started to set out some of this, pledging to raise corporation tax by less than 1.5 percent to give an Education Maintenance Allowance to college students and grants to university students so that every young learner can afford to support themselves as they develop skills and get qualifications.
Business shares in economic success and it must contribute to it too.
And I recognise that good businesses deserve a level playing field.
So I also pledge to good businesses that we will clamp down those that dodge their taxes you should not be undercut by those that don’t play by the rules.
There is nothing more unpatriotic than not paying your taxes it is an act of vandalism, damaging our NHS, damaging older people’s social care, damaging younger people’s education. So a Labour government will make shabby tax avoidance a thing of the past.
Labour’s National Education Service is going to be every bit as vital as our National Health Service has become.
And we recognise that education isn’t simply about preparing for the workplace. It’s also about the exploration of knowledge and unlocking the creativity in every human being.
So all school pupils should have the chance to learn an instrument take part in drama and dance and have regular access to a theatre, gallery or museum in their local area.
That’s why we will introduce an arts pupil premium to every primary school in England and Wales and consult on the design and national roll-out to extend this pupil premium to all secondary schools.
This will be a £160million boost for schools to invest in projects that will support cultural activities for schools over the longer-term.
It could hardly be more different to the Tory approach to education. Their only plan is the return of grammar schools, segregation and second class schooling for the majority and what a great job Angela Rayner is doing in opposing them.
So this Saturday 1 October, I want you to take the message into your community that Labour is standing up for education for all.
Grammar Schools are not the only way, the Tories are bringing division back into our society. They are also using the tried-and-tested tricks of demonising and scapegoating to distract from their failures.
Whether it be single mothers, unemployed people, disabled people or migrants, Tory failure is always someone else’s fault.
And those smears have consequences, from children being bullied in school, to attacks in the street – such as the rise of disability hate crime.
I am so proud of this party. In the last year, we stood up to the government on cuts to disabled people’s benefits and cuts to working families tax credits.
And on Monday, our shadow work &amp; pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams announced we would be scrapping the punitive sanctions regime and the degrading Work Capability Assessment.
As politicians, as political activists, as citizens, we must have zero tolerance towards those who whip up hate and division, stand together against racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and defend those being demonised.
It has been shaming to our multicultural society that assaults on migrants have increased sharply since the referendum campaign a campaign that peddled myths and whipped up division.
It isn’t migrants that drive down wages, it’s exploitative employers and the politicians who deregulate the labour market and rip up trade union rights.
It isn’t migrants who put a strain on our NHS, it only keeps going because of the migrant nurses and doctors who come here filling the gaps left by politicians who have failed to invest in training.
It isn’t migrants that have caused a housing crisis; it’s a Tory government that has failed to build homes.
Immigration can certainly put extra pressure on services and that’s why, under Gordon Brown, Labour setup the Migrant Impact Fund to provide extra funding to communities that have the largest rises in population.
What did the Tories do? They abolished it and then they demonise migrants for putting pressure on services.
A Labour government will not offer false promises on immigration as the Tories have done. We will not sow division by fanning the flames of fear. We will tackle the real issues of immigration instead whatever the eventual outcome of the Brexit negotiations and make the changes that are needed.
We will act decisively to end the undercutting of workers’ pay and conditions through the exploitation of migrant labour and agency working which would reduce the number of migrant workers in the process.
And we will ease the pressure on hard pressed public services – services that are struggling to absorb Tory austerity cuts, in communities absorbing new populations.
Labour will reinstate the migrant impact fund, and give extra support to areas of high migration using the visa levy for its intended purpose. And we will add a citizenship application fee levy to boost the fund.
That is the Labour way to tackle social tension investment and assistance, not racism and division.
This party campaigned hard to remain in the European Union. I spoke at rallies from Cornwall to Aberdeenshire for our Labour campaign to remain and reform.
But although most Labour voters backed us we did not convince millions of natural Labour voters especially in those parts of the country left behind.
Left behind by years of neglect under-investment and de-industrialisation.
Now we have to face the future together we are not helped by patronising or lecturing those in our communities who voted to leave. We have to hear their concerns about jobs, about public services, about wages, about immigration, about a future for their children. And we have to respect their votes, and the decision of the British people.
Of course that doesn’t mean giving a blank cheque to Theresa May and her three-legged team of fractious Brexiteers as they try to work up a negotiating plan and squabble about whose turn it is to have the Chevening country retreat each weekend.
We have made it clear that we will resist a Brexit at the expense of workers’ rights and social justice we have set out our red lines on employment, environmental and social protection and on access to the European market.
But we will also be pressing our own Brexit agenda including the freedom to intervene in our own industries without the obligation to liberalise or privatise our public services and building a new relationship with Europe based on cooperation and internationalism.
And as Europe faces the impact of a refugee crisis fuelled by wars across the Middle East we have to face the role that repeated military interventions by British governments have played in that crisis.
The Chilcot report made absolutely clear, the lessons to be learned from the disastrous invasion and occupation of Iraq, just as this month’s Foreign Affair Select Committee report into the war in Libya demonstrated those lessons had still not been learned a decade later.
The consequences of those wars have been the spread of terrorism, sectarianism and violence across an arc of conflict that has displaced millions of people forcing them from their countries.
That is why it was right to apologise on behalf of the party for the Iraq war right to say that we have learned the lessons and right to say that such a catastrophe must never be allowed to happen again.
We need a foreign policy based on peace, justice and human rights and what great news to hear the peace treaty in Colombia after fifty years of war and we need to honour our international treaty obligations on nuclear disarmament and encourage others to do the same.
We are a long way from that humanitarian vision. Britain continues to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, a country that the United Nations says is committing repeated violations of international humanitarian law war crimes in Yemen just as we have seen taking place in Syria.
So today I make it clear that under a Labour government when there are credible reports of human rights abuses or war crimes being committed British arms sales will be suspended, starting with Saudi Arabia.
Last year, the votes we needed to win power went many different ways in all parts of our country while millions of our potential voters stayed at home.
Many didn’t believe we offered the alternative they wanted.
It’s true there’s an electoral mountain to climb.
But if we focus everything on the needs and aspirations of middle and lower income voters, of ordinary families, if we demonstrate we’ve got a viable alternative to the government’s failed economic policies. I’m convinced we can build the electoral support that can beat the Tories.
That means being the voice of women, of young people and pensioners middle and lower income workers, the unemployed and the self-employed, minority communities and those struggling with the impact of migration at work and everyone struggling to get on, and secure a better life for themselves, their families and communities.
Running like a golden thread through Labour’s vision for today as throughout our history is the struggle for equality.
Rampant inequality has become the great scandal of our time, sapping the potential of our society, and tearing at its fabric.
Labour’s goal isn’t just greater equality of wealth and income but also of power.
Our aim could not be more ambitious. We want a new settlement for the 21st century, in politics, business, our communities with the environment, and in our relations with the rest of the world.
Every one of us in the Labour party is motivated by the gap between what our country is and what it could be.
We know that in the sixth largest economy in the world the foodbanks, stunted life chances and growing poverty alongside wealth on an undreamed of scale are a mark of shameful and unnecessary failure.
We know how great this country could be, for all its people, with a new political and economic settlement.
With new forms of democratic public ownership, driven by investment in the technology and industries of the future, with decent jobs, education and housing for all with local services run by and for people not outsourced to faceless corporations.
That’s not backward-looking, it’s the very opposite.
It’s the socialism of the 21st century.
Our job is now to win over the unconvinced to our vision. Only that way can we secure the Labour government we need.
And let’s be frank, no one will be convinced of a vision, promoted by a divided party. We all agree on that.
So I ask each and every one of you, accept the decision of the members end the trench warfare and work together to take on the Tories.
Anything else is a luxury that the millions of people who depend on Labour cannot afford.
But we could also face a general election next year.
Whatever the Prime Minister says about snap elections, there is every chance that Theresa May, will cut and run, for an early election.
So I put our party on notice today, Labour is preparing for a general election in 2017, we expect all our members to support our campaign and we will be ready for the challenge whenever it comes.
Let us do it, in the spirit of the great Scots-born Liverpool football manager Bill Shankly who said:
“The socialism I believe in, is everybody working for the same goal and everybody having a share in the rewards. That’s how I see football, that’s how I see life.”
We are not all Bill Shanklys. Each of us comes to our socialism from our own experiences.
Mine was shaped by my mum and dad, a teacher and an engineer. Both committed socialists and peace campaigners, my mum’s inspiration was to encourage girls to believe they could achieve anything in their lives.
And by working as a teacher in Jamaica when I was a young man, that taught me so much about the strength of communities living in adversity, as well as fighting for the low paid as a trade union organiser here in Britain.
As the great American poet Langston Hughes put it: “I see that my own hands can make the world that’s in my mind”.
Everyone here and every one of our hundreds of thousands of members has something to contribute to our cause.
That way we will unite, build on our policies. Take our vision out to a country crying out for change.
We are half a million of us, and there will be more, working together to make our country the place it could be.
Conference, united we can shape the future and build a fairer Britain in a peaceful world.
Thank you.
"
Franklin D. Roosevelt,"On a Sunday night a week after my Inauguration I used the radio to tell you about the banking crisis and the measures we were taking to meet it. I think that in that way I made clear to the country various facts that might otherwise have been misunderstood and in general provided a means of understanding which did much to restore confidence.
Tonight, eight weeks later, I come for the second time to give you my report -- in the same spirit and by the same means to tell you about what we have been doing and what we are planning to do.
Two months ago we were facing serious problems. The country was dying by inches. It was dying because trade and commerce had declined to dangerously low levels; prices for basic commodities were such as to destroy the value of the assets of national institutions such as banks, savings banks, insurance companies, and others. These institutions, because of their great needs, were foreclosing mortgages, calling loans, refusing credit. Thus there was actually in process of destruction the property of millions of people who had borrowed money on that property in terms of dollars which had had an entirely different value from the level of March, 1933. That situation in that crisis did not call for any complicated consideration of economic panaceas or fancy plans. We were faced by a condition and not a theory.
There were just two alternatives: The first was to allow the foreclosures to continue, credit to be withheld and money to go into hiding, and thus forcing liquidation and bankruptcy of banks, railroads and insurance companies and a recapitalizing of all business and all property on a lower level. This alternative meant a continuation of what is loosely called ""deflation"", the net result of which would have been extraordinary hardship on all property owners and, incidentally, extraordinary hardships on all persons working for wages through an increase in unemployment and a further reduction of the wage scale.
It is easy to see that the result of this course would have not only economic effects of a very serious nature but social results that might bring incalculable harm. Even before I was inaugurated I came to the conclusion that such a policy was too much to ask the American people to bear. It involved not only a further loss of homes, farms, savings and wages but also a loss of spiritual values -- the loss of that sense of security for the present and the future so necessary to the peace and contentment of the individual and of his family. When you destroy these things you will find it difficult to establish confidence of any sort in the future. It was clear that mere appeals from Washington for confidence and the mere lending of more money to shaky institutions could not stop this downward course. A prompt program applied as quickly as possible seemed to me not only justified but imperative to our national security. The Congress, and when I say Congress I mean the members of both political parties, fully understood this and gave me generous and intelligent support. The members of Congress realized that the methods of normal times had to be replaced in the emergency by measures which were suited to the serious and pressing requirements of the moment. There was no actual surrender of power, Congress still retained its constitutional authority and no one has the slightest desire to change the balance of these powers. The function of Congress is to decide what has to be done and to select the appropriate agency to carry out its will. This policy it has strictly adhered to. The only thing that has been happening has been to designate the President as the agency to carry out certain of the purposes of the Congress. This was constitutional and in keeping with the past American tradition.
The legislation which has been passed or in the process of enactment can properly be considered as part of a well-grounded plan.
First, we are giving opportunity of employment to one-quarter of a million of the unemployed, especially the young men who have dependents, to go into the forestry and flood prevention work. This is a big task because it means feeding, clothing and caring for nearly twice as many men as we have in the regular army itself. In creating this civilian conservation corps we are killing two birds with one stone. We are clearly enhancing the value of our natural resources and second, we are relieving an appreciable amount of actual distress. This great group of men have entered upon their work on a purely voluntary basis, no military training is involved and we are conserving not only our natural resources but our human resources. One of the great values to this work is the fact that it is direct and requires the intervention of very little machinery.
Second, I have requested the Congress and have secured action upon a proposal to put the great properties owned by our Government at Muscle Shoals to work after long years of wasteful inaction, and with this a broad plan for the improvement of a vast area in the Tennessee Valley. It will add to the comfort and happiness of hundreds of thousands of people and the incident benefits will reach the entire nation.
Next, the Congress is about to pass legislation that will greatly ease the mortgage distress among the farmers and the home owners of the nation, by providing for the easing of the burden of debt now bearing so heavily upon millions of our people. Our next step in seeking immediate relief is a grant of half a billion dollars to help the states, counties and municipalities in their duty to care for those who need direct and Immediate relief. The Congress also passed legislation authorizing the sale of beer in such states as desired. This has already resulted in considerable reemployment and, incidentally, has provided much needed tax revenue.
We are planning to ask the Congress for legislation to enable the Government to undertake public works, thus stimulating directly and indirectly the employment of many others in well-considered projects.
Further legislation has been taken up which goes much more fundamentally into our economic problems. The Farm Relief Bill seeks by the use of several methods, alone or together, to bring about an increased return to farmers for their major farm products, seeking at the same time to prevent in the days to come disastrous over-production which so often in the past has kept farm commodity prices far below a reasonable return. This measure provides wide powers for emergencies. The extent of its use will depend entirely upon what the future has in store.
Well-considered and conservative measures will likewise be proposed which will attempt to give to the industrial workers of the country a more fair wage return, prevent cut-throat competition and unduly long hours for labor, and at the same time to encourage each industry to prevent over-production.
Our Railroad Bill falls into the same class because it seeks to provide and make certain definite planning by the railroads themselves, with the assistance of the Government, to eliminate the duplication and waste that is now resulting in railroad receiverships and continuing operating deficits.
I am certain that the people of this country understand and approve the broad purposes behind these new governmental policies relating to agriculture and industry and transportation. We found ourselves faced with more agricultural products than we could possibly consume ourselves and surpluses which other nations did not have the cash to buy from us except at prices ruinously low. We have found our factories able to turn out more goods than we could possibly consume, and at the same time we were faced with a falling export demand. We found ourselves with more facilities to transport goods and crops than there were goods and crops to be transported. All of this has been caused in large part by a complete lack of planning and a complete failure to understand the danger signals that have been flying ever since the close of the World War. The people of this country have been erroneously encouraged to believe that they could keep on increasing the output of farm and factory indefinitely and that some magician would find ways and means for that increased output to be consumed with reasonable profit to the producer.
Today we have reason to believe that things are a little better than they were two months ago. Industry has picked up, railroads are carrying more freight, farm prices are better, but I am not going to indulge in issuing proclamations of over enthusiastic assurance. We cannot bally-ho ourselves back to prosperity. I am going to be honest at all times with the people of the country. I do not want the people of this country to take the foolish course of letting this improvement come back on another speculative wave. I do not want the people to believe that because of unjustified optimism we can resume the ruinous practice of increasing our crop output and our factory output in the hope that a kind providence will find buyers at high prices. Such a course may bring us immediate and false prosperity but it will be the kind of prosperity that will lead us into another tailspin.
It is wholly wrong to call the measure that we have taken Government control of farming, control of industry, and control of transportation. It is rather a partnership between Government and farming and industry and transportation, not partnership in profits, for the profits would still go to the citizens, but rather a partnership in planning and partnership to see that the plans are carried out.
Let me illustrate with an example. Take the cotton goods industry. It is probably true that ninety per cent of the cotton manufacturers would agree to eliminate starvation wages, would agree to stop long hours of employment, would agree to stop child labor, would agree to prevent an overproduction that would result in unsalable surpluses. But, what good is such an agreement if the other ten per cent of cotton manufacturers pay starvation wages, require long hours, employ children in their mills and turn out burdensome surpluses? The unfair ten per cent could produce goods so cheaply that the fair ninety per cent would be compelled to meet the unfair conditions. Here is where government comes in. Government ought to have the right and will have the right, after surveying and planning for an industry to prevent, with the assistance of the overwhelming majority of that industry, unfair practice and to enforce this agreement by the authority of government. The so-called anti-trust laws were intended to prevent the creation of monopolies and to forbid unreasonable profits to those monopolies. That purpose of the anti-trust laws must be continued, but these laws were never intended to encourage the kind of unfair competition that results in long hours, starvation wages and overproduction.
The same principle applies to farm products and to transportation and every other field of organized private industry.
We are working toward a definite goal, which is to prevent the return of conditions which came very close to destroying what we call modern civilization. The actual accomplishment of our purpose cannot be attained in a day. Our policies are wholly within purposes for which our American Constitutional Government was established 150 years ago.
I know that the people of this country will understand this and will also understand the spirit in which we are undertaking this policy. I do not deny that we may make mistakes of procedure as we carry out the policy. I have no expectation of making a hit every time I come to bat. What I seek is the highest possible batting average, not only for myself but for the team. Theodore Roosevelt once said to me: ""If I can be right 75 percent of the time I shall come up to the fullest measure of my hopes.""
Much has been said of late about Federal finances and inflation, the gold standard, etc. Let me make the facts very simple and my policy very clear. In the first place, government credit and government currency are really one and the same thing. Behind government bonds there is only a promise to pay. Behind government currency we have, in addition to the promise to pay, a reserve of gold and a small reserve of silver. In this connection it is worth while remembering that in the past the government has agreed to redeem nearly thirty billions of its debts and its currency in gold, and private corporations in this country have agreed to redeem another sixty or seventy billions of securities and mortgages in gold. The government and private corporations were making these agreements when they knew full well that all of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.
If the holders of these promises to pay started in to demand gold the first comers would get gold for a few days and they would amount to about one twenty-fifth of the holders of the securities and the currency. The other twenty-four people out of twenty-five, who did not happen to be at the top of the line, would be told politely that there was no more gold left. We have decided to treat all twenty-five in the same way in the interest of justice and the exercise of the constitutional powers of this government. We have placed every one on the same basis in order that the general good may be preserved.
Nevertheless, gold, and to a partial extent silver, are perfectly good bases for currency and that is why I decided not to let any of the gold now in the country go out of it.
A series of conditions arose three weeks ago which very readily might have meant, first,a drain on our gold by foreign countries, and secondly, as a result of that, a flight of American capital, in the form of gold, out of our country. It is not exaggerating the possibility to tell you that such an occurrence might well have taken from us the major part of our gold reserve and resulted in such a further weakening of our government and private credit as to bring on actual panic conditions and the complete stoppage of the wheels of industry.
The Administration has the definite objective of raising commodity prices to such an extent that those who have borrowed money will, on the average, be able to repay that money in the same kind of dollar which they borrowed. We do not seek to let them get such a cheap dollar that they will be able to pay bock a great deal less than they borrowed. In other words, we seek to correct a wrong and not to create another wrong in the opposite direction. That is why powers are being given to the Administration to provide, if necessary, for an enlargement of credit, in order to correct the existing wrong. These powers will be used when, as, and if it may be necessary to accomplish the purpose.
Hand in hand with the domestic situation which, of course, is our first concern, is the world situation, and I want to emphasize to you that the domestic situation is inevitably and deeply tied in with the conditions in all of the other nations of the world. In other words, we can get, in all probability, a fair measure of prosperity return in the United States, but it will not be permanent unless we get a return to prosperity all over the world.
In the conferences which we have held and are holding with the leaders of other nations, we are seeking four great objectives. First, a general reduction of armaments and through this the removal of the fear of invasion and armed attack, and, at the same time, a reduction in armament costs, in order to help in the balancing of government budgets and the reduction of taxation. Secondly, a cutting down of the trade barriers, in order to re-start the flow of exchange of crops and goods between nations. Third, the setting up of a stabilization of currencies, in order that trade can make contracts ahead. Fourth, the reestablishment of friendly relations and greater confidence between all nations.
Our foreign visitors these past three weeks have responded to these purposes in a very helpful way. All of the Nations have suffered alike in this great depression. They have all reached the conclusion that each can best be helped by the common action of all. It is in this spirit that our visitors have met with us and discussed our common problems. The international conference that lies before us must succeed. The future of the world demands it and we have each of us pledged ourselves to the best Joint efforts to this end.
To you, the people of this country, all of us, the Members of the Congress and the members of this Administration owe a profound debt of gratitude. Throughout the depression you have been patient. You have granted us wide powers, you have encouraged us with a wide-spread approval of our purposes. Every ounce of strength and every resource at our command we have devoted to the end of justifying your confidence. We are encouraged to believe that a wise and sensible beginning has been made. In the present spirit of mutual confidence and mutual encouragement we go forward.
"
Iain Duncan Smith,"Let me begin by thanking you for his invitation to me to address you this evening.
It was clear to me, within five minutes of arriving here, that foremost in all of our minds is the question of the war. When will it come? How will it go? Where will it end? And just to be clear, I am talking about Iraq!
On that subject, I left on Friday for the Gulf, returning just this morning. I went out there to see for myself our state of readiness, and to lend our own encouragement to the brave young British servicemen and women who have taken up their positions in the desert, awaiting their orders.
Iraq was not intended to be the main subject of my address tonight. However, the war, and related security issues, are a critical factor in the general apprehension that presently grips the business community, the country, and indeed economies – and polities – around the world.
And we have now reached a critical point.
So it is important that I make my position perfectly clear.
Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who tortures and murders his own people and poses a threat to the safety and stability of the Middle East.
Of that, I have absolutely no doubt.
And there are few people in Iraq or among its neighbours who will mourn his passing. I know there is widespread concern about the dangers of war, and where they may lead.
But I believe it will be far more dangerous if we do not act now; if we fail to deal resolutely and unhesitatingly with Saddam, once and for all.
If we don’t deal with him now, our soldiers will only have to go back – in two, or five, or ten years time – just as it is today, after 12 long years of Saddam’s cat-and-mouse game with the UN.
Saddam still holds the power to come clean; to disarm; to pull back from the brink of war, which, as any soldier will always tell you, must always be the last resort.
But he must be left in no doubt that if he does not disarm, after years of terrorism and evasion, after years of unanswered questions – from hidden weapons to missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war – then he will face the consequences.
The reality of the world didn’t change on September 11th. We had already seen the signs – the new threats had already made themselves clear. What happened on September 11th is that our understanding of the world caught up with that reality.
So this is now a crucial test. There are things at stake here — and not just for Britain and the United States — that go well beyond the outcome of this crisis. There is the credibility of the United Nations and the Security Council as instruments of international security.
There is the future of the Transatlantic relationship – which, given the importance of France and Germany in Europe and their appalling behaviour over the issuing of defence missiles to Turkey – can be said to be at its lowest ebb in 40 years. And there is a burgeoning threat to civilised, democratic values and their preservation and advancement around the world.
This is now our chance to send a very clear message to Saddam and beyond. It is, I repeat, a crucial test. We must be resolute in our determination to disarm Saddam by whatever means prove necessary, or fail it.
I want to turn, now, to our domestic concerns.
Our country faces great challenges at home – challenges which represent real threats to our day-to-day lives, and to our future.
The sooner we can return our attention to these challenges, the better it will be for all of us.
Now you will all be able to guess what I think of this Labour Government. I think this Government is hell bent on a massive programme of tax and spending, regardless of the results.
I think it is obsessed with centralised control – with targets and micro-management. I think it is wasteful – careless with your money. I think this Government is just like Labour Government have been and always will be. There is a continuity of behaviour that no amount of spin can hide.
As a politician I always have to take a moment to get the rhetoric off my chest. But I’m sure you are here for some more thorough analysis.
And in that regard, I want to make two assertions tonight –
The first is this: –
That the Labour Government has gambled its entire economic strategy on an assumption that it can continue to take more and more tax – currently £109 billion more – and that businesses and people can continue to afford it. Moreover, that if it continues to spend more and more money on the public services, they will continue to improve. They have failed and we are now paying the price.
But whereas they believe you should now be paying the price for their failure through higher taxes…
We in the Conservative Party believe – and I think the general public is coming to believe – that Labour should pay the price at the next election — by being thrown out.
My second assertion is that there is a critical connection between the state of Britain’s public services – services which Labour, despite its promises, has utterly failed to improve — and our ability to compete on the global economic playing field.
As a nation, we are now less competitive and less productive than we were in 1997. Britain must regain the competitive ground it has lost over the past six years – but it can only do so under a Conservative government committed to the reform and improvement of the public services.
So, my first assertion… Labour has gambled on a tax and spend policy, and failed. What does that mean?
Well, for that we can turn to the record.
Labour came to power saying: ‘We’ve no plans to increase tax’. Since 1997 they’ve raised the national tax bill from £270 billion to £380 billion. Next year, it will rise to £405 billion – a 50 per cent cash terms increase since 1997.
What that means is that in the past five and a half years the price per household for Government services has gone up from £11,000 to £16,500 a year.
Does it feel like we have had a 50 per cent improvement in those services?
This April’s tax increase comes in the form of National Insurance contributions – another £4 billion a year from employers, and £4 billion a year on top of that from employees.
It’s a straightforward tax on jobs and pay. Gordon Brown may have talked about an increase on National Insurance of just one penny, but the total effect is equivalent to raising the basic rate of income tax by 3p.
In 1997, the Labour manifesto said: ‘The level of public spending is no longer the best measure of the effectiveness of government action.’ And: ‘New Labour will be wise spenders, not big spenders.’
In 2002, the Chancellor committed the government to – in his own words – ‘vast increases’ in spending over the next few years.
So from this April, as the extra jobs tax kicks in, the Labour Government will break though the 50 MPH barrier.
It will be spending more than £50 million pounds an hour – that’s almost 50% faster than the rate of spending in 1997 before they came to power.
On the health service alone, spending will have risen 70% in real terms by the time of the next election.
They have pumped money into the health service in a desperate attempt to show they care, that they are doing something, never mind about the results.
They hit pensions funds while the market was at its peak and when only so-called ‘fat cats’ would complain. And because pension funds were apparently in surplus, Gordon Brown had the gall to call it a reform.
But it wasn’t a reform, it was a tax, plain and simple. Not only that, but the markets have since gone into reverse with the FTSE falling much further and faster than the Dow Jones.
Private pensions have halved since those heady days – but Mr Brown’s still raking off his £5 billion quid. This tax has had two further knock-ons.
First, companies contributing to pension funds have to replace that £5 billion, reducing their profits, and knocking about £80 billion off share values.
Second, removing the dividend tax credit has reduced the relative attractiveness of UK equities compared to bonds and overseas equities.
Unintended as these consequences may have been, they are the product of an arrogant attitude to policy making. And they have made the prospect of retirement a source of fear and anxiety for millions of hard-working people.
This pensions debacle speaks precisely to the reasons which underlie the larger failure of Labour’s tax policies.
For a start — they assumed the great bull market of the late 1990s would run and run and run.
They assumed that as the economy continued to grow, and incomes continued to grow, that they would be able to take more and more money out of British enterprise in tax, and no-one would notice.
And so they took decisions – to tax, to regulate, to spend — whose consequences they thought would be covered up, or softened up, by a growing economy.
They assumed that instead of putting in the hard work, and making the hard choices, to reform and improve our public services, they could exercise the soft option — making pledges, announcing targets, introducing schemes, undertaking initiatives.
They assumed that glittering promises and finely-spun excuses would make an effective substitute for hard results.
This has been a fatal misjudgement; policy-making at its most arrogant and most injudicious.
Policy-making, my friends, that has proved wholly unsustainable: Because we know that you cannot spend more and more money – and note that I say spend money and not invest it, – you cannot spend far faster than you are earning, while delivering less and less return on that spending, and not expect to be caught out when the market turns against you.
And now the market has turned. The gamble has failed. A flawed policy, founded in the most basic error, has run aground. The damage is done.
And there is much more damage to come – for businesses, for taxpayers, and for our public services.
Because, at precisely the moment when the economy has just grown at its slowest rate for a decade, and businesses and consumers alike are gripped by uncertainty, the Government – instead of consolidating; reassuring; being a rock of stability – is planning to do precisely the opposite. It is about to embark on a tax and spend experiment of such unprecedented scale that the Health Secretary himself – whose department will most benefit – is known to have grave concerns that the money will be wasted.
And there is every likelihood that this will indeed happen. Good money will be thrown after bad. Because Labour has balked at the hard job of introducing into the public services the efficiencies needed to ensure that they can use the new money to best effect.
You, as businessmen and women, as leaders of British enterprise, will have seen too many disquieting parallels.
Companies which assumed the old and unforgiving rules of economics had somehow been suspended.
Executives who pursued disastrous strategies.
Who re-engineered corporate finances to breaking point – Then when it all snapped, destroyed the wealth of millions of stockholders, and were disgraced and dismissed.
I think it’s time we understood this Labour Government in the same way.
They had so much going for them – a golden economic legacy, the vast goodwill of so many in business and among the electorate, two landslide election victories, a massive majority in the Commons.
They have squandered it all.
They have failed to deliver.
They have destroyed wealth, not created it.
Indeed, ironically, it is their very policies that have helped create the malaise that is now catching them out.
At the earliest opportunity, they should be dismissed.
Let me turn now, to my second assertion – that there is a critical connection between the state of Britain’s public services – services which Labour, despite their promises, have utterly failed to improve — and our ability to compete on the global economic playing field.
Let me explain my view of how that connection is made.
In 1997, Britain voted for a change.
It is not my job to tell Britain that it was wrong to make that choice. It is my job to understand why Britain made that choice.
We could understand the lure, for many voters, of more money for schools and hospitals and more support for patients, parents and the lowest earners.
But something deeper was going on. Across the board, people were coming to recognise that being able to compete had to be about more that just economic efficiency.
To compete meant being a country where people wanted to live, where people were optimistic, where businesses would choose to locate their operations.
A place that would attract and retain the best talent and the most investment. A place with something extra to offer.
To compete meant being a nation with a well educated, highly qualified workforce that didn’t waste weeks every year, off sick, or stuck in traffic jams.
People had come to understand that the poor quality of our public services was holding us back.
Britain needed better public services, a better quality of life.
For years, we had worked hard to improve our standard of living.
18 years of Conservative Government had yielded a wonderful legacy – we had taken the sick man of Europe and turned it into a wealthy, enterprising and confident nation.
But there was work still to do.
In 1997, the debate was shifting from standard of living to quality of life.
Tony Blair took advantage of this and, on the promise of delivering a better quality of life while not threatening our standard of living, he carried the country on a tidal wave of support.
His use of pledges and slogans was brilliant, and helped him to capture the imagination. But all this did was mask his party’s true colours.
So unfortunately, we’re now no further on than we were six years ago. In fact, we’ve fallen further behind.
Britain is a country where people are afraid to fall ill; where their children are not guaranteed a decent education; where our infrastructure – from the transport system to our local communities – is falling apart.
Over a million people are still on hospital waiting lists, waiting for treatment in a health service that now has more administrators than it has beds.
If you need an operation in France, the maximum wait is four weeks. If you need one in Britain, the average wait is 4.3 months.
In Accident and Emergency, NHS patients have to wait hours – first just to be seen, then to be admitted. In Germany, all patients are seen within minutes of arrival.
And all this despite a dramatic increase in resources. Over the last two years, health spending has gone up by 22 per cent. And what did it deliver? A paltry 1.6 per cent increase in hospital treatments, and a half-percent decline in hospital admissions.
Our education system is leaving more and more children behind.
One quarter of 11 years olds leave primary schools unable to read, write and count properly.
30,000 young people leave school each year without a single GCSE. The gap between inner city school and the rest is getting wider.
The failure of our schools to deliver for all is no good for business and no good for society.
As for crime, despite all of Labour’s pledges, it keeps getting worse. Gun crime soaring, robbery way up, domestic burglary up, drug offences up.
A crime is now committed every five second in England and Wales.
So Labour’s policies have had little impact – the challenge to improve British people’s quality of life remains.
But meanwhile, what other competitive advantages we did have are being eroded.
The burden on business is up, and our competitiveness and productivity growth down.
The CBI believes Labour’s new regulations alone have added £15 billion to the cost of doing business in Britain.
And since 1997
– we’ve lost over half a million jobs in manufacturing,
– we’ve seen the number of days lost to strikes increased sixfold
– and we’ve fallen from 9th to 16th place in the World Competitiveness rankings.
Over the last year, business investment has fallen at its sharpest rate for more than three decades.
As a global competitor, we have lost a lot of ground.
With taxes up, we’re a more expensive place to do business.
With regulation up, we’re no longer an easy place to do business.
With our public services in decay, we’re no longer a magnet for the world’s top talents and skills.
Instead, we have a government that has so completely lost control of its own policies on asylum that Britain has become the destination for a flood of economic migrants – more than 100,000 last year alone, who put further pressure on our straining services and finances.
These are the issues to which a Conservative government will give priority.
What does this mean for business?
First, we are, by nature, a party of lower tax.
It flows from our belief in smaller government, greater individual liberty, and greater personal responsibility.
It flows from our belief that governments should measure success not by how much they spend of your money, but how well – and how carefully – they spend it.
And our belief – also — that low-tax economies are more efficient, and more competitive, than high-tax economies.
Second, a Conservative Government will not be trying to second-guess everything you do. We will not be over-interfering in the way you run your businesses.
And unlike the Labour Government, we mean what we say when we say that we’ll cut red tape, and we’ll ask for your advice on how to do it.
Thirdly, on public services we are committed to a strategy of reform, widening choice, and rooting out waste.
Up and down the country, Conservative councils are putting this approach into practice and using people’s money more carefully.
What sets us so completely apart from Labour is that we understand how important it is to have a holistic approach. Without strong businesses, you cannot have a strong economy.
Without a strong economy you cannot have strong public services. Without strong public services, you cannot have strong businesses. And without all these things you can’t have a strong country. This, I hope, is in our future.
But there is still today to contend with. Indeed, we have two to three years of this Government still to run.
The Chancellor has already badly miscalculated.
His tax and spend gamble has failed. It is clear that more money alone is not the answer to better healthcare. Or to improving any other public service for that matter.
But on the way to finding this out, Mr Brown and Mr Blair have damaged us. Undermined our competitiveness and left us all poorer.
The Chancellor’s policy is running into heavy weather. Already holed below the waterline, he now risks steering the country onto the rocks.
It is not too late to change course. Indeed he has a month left to scrap his new tax on pay and jobs. He still has time to admit that his failed policies are damaging the economy – and to recognise that our public services need real reform.
But what concerns me now, and you may share this concern, is that he will not change course in time, and that before someone else gets the chance we will already have run aground.
"
Michael Brotherton,"I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the subject of road communications on the south bank of the Humber. First, I would like the House to consider the geography of the Humber, north and south. There are two main ports on the Humber—Immingham, on the south bank, and Hull, on the north bank. Grimsby, a secondary port, is on the south bank. Grimsby and Immingham are, in fact, the same port: they are jointly called the port of Grimsby and Immingham by the British Transport Docks Board. On the south bank we have very poor road communications. Recently there has been completed the M62, which runs from Hull across the country to Liverpool. It runs the whole way across the nation. On the south bank, however, we have nothing like that.
We are building at the moment the Humber Bridge, which is to connect the two banks. There are those who say that the bridge is being built because there was a by-election in Hull in January 1966 and the right hon. That bridge is in the process of being constructed, and we all know now that, although it started at an estimated cost of £19 million, the cost will eventually end up at about £90 million. There is no way of preventing that bridge from being completed. It is a white elephant; it is unnecessary, and it goes from nowhere to nowhere. When it comes to the south bank of the Humber, there is no real road communication that is of any use at all.
Why do we need good roads on the south bank? The ports of Immingham and Grimsby together are the brightest jewel in the crown of the British Transport Docks Board. They make an enormous profit. Hull makes a loss while Grimsby and Immingham make a huge profit. At Immingham, which is in my constituency, we have ICI, Fisons and the ​ port, and millions of tons of goods go over the quay there every year. Immingham is the sixth largest port in the United Kingdom. Yet we have no roads. Grimsby is a great fishing port, but the Department of Transport has said recently that it is not to be regarded as a port at all.
The M180 is the road that is to go from the Humber Bridge across to Immingham and Grimsby. We are told that it will stop just short of Grimsby because Grimsby is no longer to be regarded as a major port. The road is to end at Pywipe. Pywipe is a field just outside Grimsby in my constituency. This dual carriageway is to end in a ploughed field, and we are told that this is because the Department of Transport no longer regards Grimsby as a major port.
It is not for me to make the case for Grimsby, because Grimsby is not in my constituency. Grimsby, however, is the major fishing port of the Humber. In Grimsby there are such factories as Findus, La Porte and Ross. There are other major food processors. Many of my constituents in Cleethorpes work in Grimsby. If one were to drive along the A18 on any night when the fishing vessels have come into Grimsby, one would know that many dozens of lorries go along that route. A tremendous traffic block is built up night after night because Grimsby, regardless of what the Ministry may say, is a port. Regardless of what the Ministry may say, Grimsby is a major fishing port which generates a tremendous amount of traffic.
My constituents in Cleethorpes, Humberston and the surrounding towns go to Grimsby to work or to fish. They may go to work in the factories that I have mentioned. As a result of all the jobs in which those people are engaged, traffic is generated and enormous numbers of lorries have to go along these roads. We are now told by the Ministry that nothing will be done: first, that nothing will be done until the 1980s and, secondly, that the road will stop at Pywipe.
Can the Minister really say that he regards Grimsby not to be a port? Can he really say that he does not regard the people in my constituency as working in a port? Can he really say that the traffic going from Grimsby towards the ​ Humber Bridge, or the traffic going towards the Al and Ml, is not important? Can he really say that he does not believe that this road is important?
I have said that we have the M62 on the north bank of the Humber. What is required on the south bank, as all those who work on the south bank know, is a decent east-west road communications system. The Humber Bridge is of little use to my constituents or to all those who work on the south bank. What is required is something which will tie in with the Al and MI north-south major trunk roads of the United Kingdom. We need roads which will tie in with the M62 so that we can get across the country to Liverpool.
At the moment, we have absolutely nothing at all. The M180 is being built and the Brigg bypass has been completed. Obviously, those who live in that area thank the Minister and the Department for what has been done, but the fact remains that the south bank is being betrayed in that we do not have a sufficient communications system which tics in with the north-south trunk routes of the nation. We are being totally ignored by the Department. We are being ignored to the extent that even the planning of the road will stop at Pywipe and will not even continue into Grimsby.
Those who live on the south bank of the Humber regard with great cynicism the granting of development area status to the south bank of the Humber just before the Grimsby by-election of about a year ago. Just over a year ago, the south bank of the Humber was given development area status, but since then nothing has been done to improve our communications or to give us a decent road system. Nothing has been done to help the people of Grimsby and Immingham to communicate with the rest of the country. People are in despair. What will the Minister do to help us?
"
James K. Polk,"To the House of Representatives of the United States:
In answer to the resolutions of the House of Representatives of the 10th instant, requesting information in relation to New Mexico and California, I communicate herewith reports from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Navy, with the documents which accompany the same. These reports and documents contain information upon the several points of inquiry embraced by the resolutions. ""The proper limits and boundaries of New Mexico and California"" are delineated on the map referred to in the late treaty with Mexico, an authentic copy of which is herewith transmitted; and all the additional information upon that subject, and also the most reliable information in respect to the population of these respective Provinces, which is in the possession of the Executive will be found in the accompanying report of the Secretary of State.
The resolutions request information in regard to the existence of civil governments in New Mexico and California, their ""form and character,"" by ""whom instituted,"" by ""what authority,"" and how they are ""maintained and supported.""
In my message of December 22, 1846, in answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives calling for information ""in relation to the establishment or organization of civil government in any portion of the territory of Mexico which has or might be taken possession of by the Army or Navy of the United States,"" I communicated the orders which had been given to the officers of our Army and Navy, and stated the general authority upon which temporary military governments had been established over the conquered portion of Mexico then in our military occupation.
The temporary governments authorized were instituted by virtue of the rights of war. The power to declare war against a foreign country, and to prosecute it according to the general laws of war, as sanctioned by civilized nations, it will not be questioned, exists under our Constitution. When Congress has declared that war exists with a foreign nation, ""the general laws of war apply to our situation,"" and it becomes the duty of the President, as the constitutional ""Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States,"" to prosecute it.
In prosecuting a foreign war thus duly declared by Congress, we have the right, by ""conquest and military occupation,"" to acquire possession of the territories of the enemy, and, during the war, to ""exercise the fullest rights of sovereignty over it."" The sovereignty of the enemy is in such case ""suspended,"" and his laws can ""no longer be rightfully enforced"" over the conquered territory ""or be obligatory upon the inhabitants who remain and submit to the conqueror. By the surrender the inhabitants pass under a temporary allegiance"" to the conqueror, and are ""bound by such laws, and such only, as"" he may choose to recognize and impose. ""From the nature of the case, no other laws could be obligatory upon them, for where there is no protection or allegiance or sovereignty there can be no claim to obedience."" These are well-established principles of the laws of war, as recognized and practiced by civilized nations, and they have been sanctioned by the highest judicial tribunal of our own country.
The orders and instructions issued to the officers of our Army and Navy, applicable to such portions of the Mexican territory as had been or might be conquered by our arms, were in strict conformity to these principles. They were, indeed, ameliorations of the rigors of war upon which we might have insisted. They substituted for the harshness Of military rule something of the mildness of civil government, and were not only the exercise of no excess of power, but were a relaxation in favor of the peaceable inhabitants of the conquered territory who had submitted to our authority, and were alike politic and humane.
It is from the same source of authority that we derive the unquestioned right, after the war has been declared by Congress, to blockade the ports and coasts of the enemy, to capture his towns, cities, and provinces, and to levy contributions upon him for the support of our Army. Of the same character with these is the right to subject to our temporary military government the conquered territories of our enemy. They are all belligerent rights, and their exercise is as essential to the successful prosecution of a foreign war as the right to fight battles.
New Mexico and Upper California were among the territories conquered and occupied by our forces, and such temporary governments were established over them. They were established by the officers of our Army and Navy in command, in pursuance of the orders and instructions accompanying my message to the House of Representatives of December 22, 1846. In their form and detail, as at first established, they exceeded in some respects, as was stated in that message, the authority which had been given, and instructions for the correction of the error were issued in dispatches from the War and Navy Departments of the 11th of January, 1847, copies of which are herewith transmitted. They have been maintained and supported out of the military exactions and contributions levied upon the enemy, and no part of the expense has been paid out of the Treasury of the United States.
In the routine of duty some of the officers of the Army and Navy who first established temporary governments in California and New Mexico have been succeeded in command by other officers, upon whom light duties devolved; and the agents employed or designated by them to conduct the temporary governments have also, in some instances, been superseded by others. Such appointments for temporary civil duty during our military occupation were made by the officers in command in the conquered territories, respectively.
On the conclusion and exchange of ratifications of a treaty of peace with Mexico, which was proclaimed on the 4th instant, these temporary governments necessarily ceased to exist. In the instructions to establish a temporary government over New Mexico, no distinction was made between that and the other Provinces of Mexico which might be conquered and held in our military occupation.
The Province of New Mexico, according to its ancient boundaries, as claimed by Mexico, lies on both sides of the Rio Grande. That part of it on the east of that river was in dispute when the war between the United States and Mexico commenced. Texas, by a successful revolution in April, 1836, achieved, and subsequently maintained, her independence. By an act of the Congress of Texas passed in December, 1836, her western boundary was declared to be the Rio Grande from its mouth to its source, and thence due north to the forty-second degree of north latitude. Though the Republic of Texas, by many acts of sovereignty which she asserted and exercised, some of which were stated in my annual message of December, 1846, had established her clear title to the country west of the Nueces, and bordering upon that part of the Rio Grande which lies below the Province of New Mexico, she had never conquered or reduced to actual possession and brought under her Government and laws that part of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande, which she claimed to be within her limits. On the breaking out of the war we found Mexico in possession of this disputed territory. As our Army approached Sante Fe (the capital of New Mexico) it was found to be held by a governor under Mexican authority, with an armed force collected to resist our advance. The inhabitants were Mexicans, acknowledging allegiance to Mexico. The boundary in dispute was the line between the two countries engaged in actual war, and the settlement of it of necessity depended on a treaty of peace. Finding the Mexican authorities and people in possession, our forces conquered them, and extended military rule over them and the territory which they actually occupied, in lieu of the sovereignty which was displaced. It was not possible to disturb or change the practical boundary line in the midst of the war, when no negotiation for its adjustment could be opened, and when Texas was not present, by her constituted authorities, to establish and maintain government over a hostile Mexican population who acknowledged no allegiance to her. There was, therefore, no alternative left but to establish and maintain military rule during the war over the conquered people in the disputed territory who had submitted to our arms, or to forbear the exercise of our belligerent rights and leave them in a state of anarchy and without control.
Whether the country in dispute rightfully belonged to Mexico or to Texas, it was our right in the first case, and our duty as well as our right in the latter, to conquer and hold it. Whilst this territory was in our possession as conquerors, with a population hostile to the United States, which more than once broke out in open insurrection, it was our unquestionable duty to continue our military occupation of it until the conclusion of the war, and to establish over it a military government, necessary for our own security as well as for the protection of the conquered people.
By the joint resolution of Congress of March 1, 1845, ""for annexing Texas to the United States,"" the ""adjustment of all questions of boundary which may arise with other governments"" was reserved to this Government. When the conquest of New Mexico was consummated by our arms, the question of boundary remained still unadjusted. Until the exchange of the ratifications of the late treaty, New Mexico never became an undisputed portion of the United States, and it would therefore have been premature to deliver over to Texas that portion of it on the east side of the Rio Grande, to which she asserted a claim. However just the right of Texas may have been to it, that right had never been reduced into her possession, and it was contested by Mexico.
By the cession of the whole of New Mexico, on both sides of the Rio Grande, to the United States, the question of disputed boundary, so far as Mexico is concerned, has been settled, leaving the question as to the true limits of Texas in New Mexico to be adjusted between that State and the United States.
Under the circumstances existing during the pendency of the war, and while the whole of New Mexico, as claimed by our enemy, was in our military occupation, I was not unmindful of the rights of Texas to that portion of it which she claimed to be within her limits. In answer to a letter from the governor of Texas dated on the 4th of January, 1847, the Secretary of State, by my direction, informed him in a letter of the 12th of February, 1847, that in the President's annual message of December, 1846--
You have already perceived that New Mexico is at present in the temporary occupation of the troops of the United States, and the government over it is military in its character. It is merely such a government as must exist under the laws of nations and of war to preserve order and protect the rights of the inhabitants, and will cease on the conclusion of a treaty of peace with Mexico. Nothing, therefore, can be more certain than that this temporary government, resulting from necessity, can never injuriously affect the right which the President believes to be justly asserted by Texas to the whole territory on this side of the Rio Grande whenever the Mexican claim to it shall have been extinguished by treaty. But this is a subject which more properly belongs to the legislative than the executive branch of the Government.
The result of the whole is that Texas had asserted a right to that part of New Mexico east of the Rio Grande, which is believed, under the acts of Congress for the annexation and admission of Texas into the Union as a State, and under the constitution and laws of Texas, to be well founded; but this right had never been reduced to her actual possession and occupancy. The General Government, possessing exclusively the war-making power, had the right to take military possession of this disputed territory, and until the title to it was perfected by a treaty of peace it was their duty to hold it and to establish a temporary military government over it for the preservation of the conquest itself, the safety of our Army, and the security of the conquered inhabitants.
The resolutions further request information whether any persons have been tried and condemned for ""treason against the United States in that part of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande since the same has been in the occupancy of our Army,"" and, if so, before ""what tribunal"" and ""by what authority of law such tribunal was established."" It appears that after the territory in question was ""in the occupancy of our Army"" some of the conquered Mexican inhabitants, who had at first submitted to our authority, broke out in open insurrection, murdering our soldiers and citizens and committing other atrocious crimes. Some of the principal offenders who were apprehended were tried and condemned by a tribunal invested with civil and criminal jurisdiction, which had been established in the conquered country by the military officer in command. That the offenders deserved the punishment inflicted upon them there is no reason to doubt, and the error in the proceedings against them consisted in designating and describing their crimes as ""treason against the United States."" This error was pointed out, and its recurrence thereby prevented, by the Secretary of War in a dispatch to the officer in command in New Mexico dated on the 26th of June, 1847, a copy of which, together with copies of all communications relating to the subject which have been received at the War Department, is herewith transmitted.
The resolutions call for information in relation to the quantity of the public lands acquired within the ceded territory, and ""how much of the same is within the boundaries of Texas as defined by the act of the Congress of the Republic of Texas of the 19th day of December, 1836."" No means of making an accurate estimate on the subject is in the possession of the executive department. The information which is possessed will be found in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The country ceded to the United States lying west of the Rio Grande, and to which Texas has no title, is estimated by the commissioner of the General Land Office to contain 526,078 square miles, or 336,689,920 acres.
The period since the exchange of ratifications of the treaty has been too short to enable the Government to have access to or to procure abstracts or copies of the land titles issued by Spain or by the Republic of Mexico. Steps will be taken to procure this information at the earliest practicable period. It is estimated, as appears from the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Treasury, that much the larger portion of the land within the territories ceded remains vacant and unappropriated, and will be subject to be disposed of by the United States. Indeed, a very inconsiderable portion of the land embraced in the cession, it is believed, has been disposed of or granted either by Spain or Mexico.
What amount of money the United States may be able to realize from the sales of these vacant lands must be uncertain, but it is confidently believed that with prudent management, after making liberal grants to emigrants and settlers, it will exceed the cost of the war and all the expenses to which we have been subjected in acquiring it.
The resolutions also call for ""the evidence, or any part thereof, that the 'extensive and valuable territories ceded by Mexico to the United States constitute indemnity for the past.""'
The immense value of the ceded country does not consist alone in the amount of money for which the public lands may be sold. If not a dollar could be realized from the sale of these lands, the cession of the jurisdiction over the country and the fact that it has become a part of our Union and can not be made subject to any European power constitute ample ""indemnity for the past"" in the immense value and advantages which its acquisition must give to the commercial, navigating, manufacturing, and agricultural interests of our country.
The value of the public lands embraced within the limits of the ceded territory, great as that value may be, is far less important to the people of the United States than the sovereignty over the country. Most of our States contain no public lands owned by the United States, and yet the sovereignty and jurisdiction over them is of incalculable importance to the nation. In the State of New York the United States is the owner of no public lands, and yet two-thirds of our whole revenue is collected at the great port of that State, and within her limits is found about one-seventh of our entire population. Although none of the future cities on our coast of California may ever rival the city of New York in wealth, population, and business, yet that important cities will grow up on the magnificent harbors of that coast, with a rapidly increasing commerce and population, and yielding a large revenue, would seem to be certain. By the possession of the safe and capacious harbors on the Californian coast we shall have great advantages in securing the rich commerce of the East, and shall thus obtain for our products new and increased markets and greatly enlarge our coasting and foreign trade, as well as augment our tonnage and revenue.
These great advantages, far more than the simple value of the public lands in the ceded territory, ""constitute our indemnity for the past.""

Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Please. You just like all those brand new, beautiful airplanes that we're buying. It's been a long time since I've been here. And what a place. What a place it is. At ease, everybody.
And you truly make America proud. You make us all proud. Thank you very much. Great job. Really great job. And I want to thank Secretary Wilson for the introduction and for her two years of service as the first graduate of the academy to be the very important Secretary of the Air Force at a time when we've really expanded out the Air Force and bought equipment like you've never seen before.
So, congratulations. Thank you very much, Heather. Beautiful job. And I want to thank three other truly remarkable former cadets: your Superintendent, Lieutenant General Jay Silvaria. Class of 1985. Jay, I thought you were a little bit younger than that. Thank you, General.
Great job. Does a great job; respected by everybody. And NORTHCOM Commander, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, Class of 1986. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, General. We're also grateful to be joined by Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, General John Hyten. General, thank you very much.
Spent a lot of time together talking about things. Thank you, General. Space Command. And to all of the distinguished faculty, coaches, and staff, thank you for forging and refining a new generation of American warriors.
We're also joined by many distinguished Air Force veterans and academy graduates. We applaud and salute you all. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. And to the thousands of moms and dads and grandparents and family members beaming with joy -- and that's what they're doing; they are beaming with joy -- thank you for raising rock-ribbed American patriots.
America is stronger thanks to your love and your support for these incredible people -- these incredible graduates. Cadets, join me in paying tribute to your amazing Air Force families. Go ahead, pay tribute. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. Without them, you wouldn't be here, and that's the way it is.
They said, ""Sir, you don't have to shake any hands."" Some people do that. Those are the smart ones. They're out of here. You could shake 10, 50, or 100, and you could also stay for 1,000. And I'm staying for 1,000. Okay? And I know we're all going to make it.
There's no doubt about it. To the nearly 1,000 cadets who will soon become Second Lieutenants in the U.S. Air Force: You could have chosen any school, any career you wanted, but you chose a harder path and a higher calling: to protect and defend the United States of America. I know what you've been through, and it's tougher.
But you know what? In the end, it's better. You're going see. You'll see. Today, you take your place as officers in the most powerful Air Force in the history of our country and, frankly and very easily, in the history of the world. America commends the integrity, devotion, and commitment of the Class of 2019. When you choose the Air Force, you choose the noble road of service and duty and devotion.
You choose to break old boundaries, and unlock new frontiers, and live life on the cutting edge. The first air combat happened just one century ago. You are the ones who will invent and define the next generation of air warfare. And you are the ones who will secure American victory all the time. Victory.
To dominate the future, America must rule the skies. And that is what your time at this great academy has been all about: preparing you to do whatever it takes to learn, to adapt, and to win, win, win. You're going to win so much. You're going to get so tired of winning, but not really.
We never get tired of winning, do we.
No. Over the past four years, that's just what you've done. You've worked. You've preserved -- persevered. You've excelled. You've done so many things that nobody else can do. And, in the end, you've come out on top. It took years of focus and discipline to get here, starting long before ""Beast."" Right?
Beast. You all know what ""Beast"" is, right. Only 1 out of every 10 applicants makes the cut. And don't forget: Out of those 10 applicants, there are hundreds that think about it, but they know they don't even have a chance.
So remember that. It's actually -- actually true. For those who are accepted, another 20 percent don't make it to graduation, sadly. Only the best survive to the very end. And here, under the majestic peaks of the Rockies, you have risen to every challenge, overcome every single obstacle, and proven yourselves worthy of the bars that will soon adorn your uniform.
You survived BCT, made it to Recognition, and earned your Prop and Wings. You soared in gliders, piloted aircraft, and launched satellites that are now orbiting way, way above us, looking down on us. You performed advanced research, developed new technol -- techniques. You honed your skills as cyber operators, and jumped out of planes thousands of feet above the Earth.
Not easy. For America's airmen, the sky is never, ever the limit. That being said, even the best cadets can sometimes get a little bit carried away. Lieutenant General Silvaria has informed me that a few cadets are still on restriction for pranks and other fairly bad mischief.
And you all know who you are. And that, you earned. You earned it. So you're all on even footing. Is that nice.
Two graduating cadets recently received one of the most prestigious awards in all of academia: Rhodes scholarships. Please join me in congratulating cadets James Brahm and Madison Tung. Please stand up. Wow. Thank you very much. That's a big -- a big, fat congratulations from me. That's a tremendous, tremendous job you've done.
Thank you. Thank you, Madison. Great job. On the athletic fields, the Air Force has won 15 conference championships over the last four years, which is really something. A hundred and fifty-three athletes have earned All-American honors. Stand up. Stand up. All-American. Wow. Wow. It's fantastic.
Congratulations. Including Rifle Team members Anna Weilbacher and Spencer Cap, who helped the Falcons win the air rifle national title and beat the other service academies to bring home the President's Trophy. Please, stand up. Stand up. It's fantastic. But you didn't enjoy beating those other academies.
I don't think so, right? Not too much. And graduating cadet Nick Ready became the first person from any service academy to win the College Home Run Derby -- wow, that's a big deal -- with a record-breaking 55 home runs. Nick, where are you, Nick? Stand up. Come here, Nick. Come here. Get up here, Nick.
Come here. Come here, Nick. You know, they gave him such a lousy seat all the way back in the corner. Baseball. Home Run Derby. That's something. In all of college baseball. Wow. I want to feel this guy's muscles. That's real. That's great. Thank you very much, Nick.
That's a big deal. That's a big deal. The members of this class come from every background, every state in the union, and even from our allies overseas. But through trial and training and tradition, you've become one family. It's what's happened. And like one family, you have all been pulling for one of your classmates, who has bravely fought his battle with cancer.
Today, Parker Hammond graduates as a munitions and missiles maintenance officer -- -- along with the class that has stood with him every step of the way. Great -- come on, Parker. Get up here, Parker. Parker. Come here. Come here, right? Come here. They love you, Parker. Why do you like him so much?
Great job. Great. A lot of good-looking people in this school, I have to say. This class personifies the spirit of confidence and courage and unwavering commitment that has always defined the Long Blue Line. It's true. It goes all the way back to the very beginning, to the first cadet in the Air Force history.
On in-processing day, you've -- greeted at the base of a ramp by the statue of the legendary Val Bourque. Val grew up in a blue-collar family in Massachusetts. During his senior year in high school, he was recruited to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates. That's another baseball player. But instead, Val made the same choice as all of you: the choice of life of service.
That's what he wanted. Val joined the U.S. Air Force Academy. He showed up at 4:30 a.m. on the Academy's opening day in 1955, so he would be the first Air Force cadet in history to take the Oath of Allegiance. He was thinking fast. The Academy proved an arduous challenge, however, for Val. It wasn't easy.
As Val's roommate said, ""He was hanging on by a thread academically. No one was tested more than Val was."" That's what his roommate said. After Val finally made it to where you're sitting today, he volunteered to go to Vietnam and he proved to be one of the best pilots America had.
He was amazing. He was incredible. After nearly a year of intense action, he was scheduled to return home. He was very excited but he asked to lead one more mission. On that day, Val's plane was struck by enemy fire, and he made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. He now rests on these precious grounds, and his fighting spirit lives in each and every one of you.
Great fighting spirit. The heroes and legends of every generation have always had to confront new perils and defeat new dangers. No one can foresee all of the challenges this class will face, but we do know that, with absolute certainty, you are going to be ready to serve. You are going to be ready to lead.
You are going to be aiming at the absolute highest point. And you are ready to ""Fly, Fight, and Win."" Always win. Always. You exemplify the grit, the guts, and the grace that make America's Air Force, by far, the best in the world. And in the words of your class motto, ""Conquer Mind, Conquer All."" Each of you has the sharp intellect, deep character, inner strength, and the titanium courage to vanquish any menace that dares to threaten our country or our people.
We're always ready. Right, General? Always ready. He's ready. I wonder how that's going to be viewed -- that statement -- tomorrow in the press. And that's okay. Let them think whatever they want to think. More than half of you will soon head to pilot training, where you will prepare to unleash American thunder anywhere we need.
Another 45 will join our Remotely Piloted Aircraft program. A record number of you will become space operators. You will specialize in combat rescues, intelligence, missile maintenance, weather, air traffic control, engineering, and much, much more. Each of you is graduating at a truly incredible time for our country.
Our country is doing well. Our country is respected again. We are respected again. And we're reawakening American pride, American confidence, and American greatness. You know that. These gentlemen know it; I'll tell you right now. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's very nice.
And we are restoring the fundamental principle that our first obligation and highest loyalty is to the American citizen. No longer will we sacrifice America's interests to any foreign power. We don't do that anymore. In all things and ways, we are putting America first, and it's about time.
Our economy is booming, our people are thriving, and our military is stronger, mightier, and more powerful -- with all of that new aircraft -- than ever before. I am committed to keeping our military the best trained, best equipped, and most technologically advanced fighting force anywhere under the sun.
Last year, against some pretty strong opposition, which I'll always have, we secured $700 billion to support our warfighters, followed by another $716 billion -- not million -- billion. That's with a ""B. That means we are delivering 56 new Air Force F-35s, brand new stealth.
I asked somebody on the other side, ""What do you think of that plane?"" A foreign leader. They said, ""We have a problem with it; we can't see it. It's always good when they can't see you. Twenty-four new Reaper remotely piloted Aircraft, fifteen new Pegasus aerial refueling aircraft, ten new combat rescue helicopters, and a well-earned pay raise for every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine in the United States military.
And if anybody wants to give up your raise, it's okay. We'll accept that. Okay. We have things under development, the likes of which you've never seen; the likes of which you can't even conceive.
Artificial intelligence, nuclear weapons and modernization, and space superiority. And we're soon having, as you know, something that I started. And it started a little slow, and now everybody has embraced it: Space Force. And you're going to be working with them. And, General, I want to thank you for helping us so much.
It's been really great. Working with you has been great. A whole new force. In this stadium today are many of the future leaders who will develop the doctrine, strategy, and technology to restore America's legacy of leadership in space. As you know, other nations are moving aggressively to weaponize space with new technologies that can disrupt vital communications and blind satellites that are critical to our battlefield operations.
It is a time for America to reclaim the ultimate high ground and prepare our young warriors of today for victory on the battlefield tomorrow. It's a very different battlefield. It's a very different type of warfare. But we are so advanced. And when you see what's coming, you won't even believe it. And hopefully -- you know what?
Hopefully, we never have to use it. Peace through strength. Peace through strength. As your Commander-in-Chief, I want you to know that we will pursue and maintain the overwhelming strength we need to deter any aggressor and thrash any foe. For that reason, I am committed to building the Air Force we need with the full strength of 386 squadrons.
And we're getting it done, too. It's happening rapidly. Because nothing will ever strike more fear in the hearts of our enemies or inspire more confidence in our friends than the roaring engines of American fighter jets, flown by the greatest pilots on the planet Earth, by far: you. The sound of American warplanes is the righteous sound of American justice.
Today, you inherit a legacy of service and valor handed down through generations. It's a tradition built by legends like Rickenbacker, Doolittle, Wagner, Archer, Boyd, Yeager, Sijan, Grissom, and Chapman. Great people. Great people. These trailblazers broke barriers after barrier, and they innovated and adapted to push America further, faster, and on to total victory.
It is the same spirit embodied by your Class Exemplar, Neil Armstrong, who started out flying jets over Korea, and, 50 years ago this summer, planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. Just like all the aces of our past and the heroes of our history, they were ready to lead when America needed them most.
And so is every cadet who graduates today. Is that correct? I think so. You are the patriots whose names will go down in Air Force history. You will redefine warfare at a very, very critical time in our country's history. You'll win great battles and bring our enemies to crushing defeat. You will explore the boundaries of space, and keep America forever proud and forever free.
So today, you take the controls. You're going to push it up and chart your course across the sky. Keep the wings level and true, because your country is sending you on a vital mission: to defend America, protect our people, and to pursue our nation's great and glorious destiny. Nothing will stop you from victory.
Nothing will stop the U.S. Air Force. And with your help, nothing ever, ever will stop the United States of America. So I want to conclude by giving a very special congratulations to a very special group of amazing cadets and people. It's the Class of 2019.
On behalf of our nation, God bless you, God bless the Air Force, and God bless America. This is a great honor being with you. Thank you. And congratulations to everybody. Thank you.

King Edward VII,"My Lords and Gentlemen,
My relations with all the Foreign Powers continue to be friendly.
The blockade of Venezuelan ports, rendered necessary by outrages on the British flag and wrongs inflicted on the persons and property of British subjects by the Venezuelan Government, has led to negotiations for the adjustment of all the matters in dispute. I rejoice that a settlement has now been arrived at which has justified the blockading Powers in bringing all hostile naval operations to an immediate close. Papers on the subject have been laid before you.
Negotiations have taken place for the adjustment of the questions which have arisen with regard to the boundary between My possessions in North America and the territory of Alaska. A treaty providing for the reference of these questions to an Arbitral Tribunal has been signed and ratified.
The condition of the European provinces of Turkey gives cause for serious anxiety. I have used My best efforts to impress upon the Sultan and his Ministers the urgent need for practical and well-considered measures of reform. The Governments of Austria-Hungary and Russia have had under their consideration what reforms it would be desirable that the Powers who were parties to the Treaty of Berlin should recommend to the Sultan for immediate adoption. I trust that the proposals made will prove to be sufficient for the purpose, and that I shall find it possible to give them My hearty support. Papers on the subject will be laid before you.
I regret that the efforts which My Government have been making to arrive at a joint delimitation with the Turkish Government of the boundaries of the tribal country adjoining Aden have hitherto failed to bring about a settlement. Negotiations upon this subject are being urgently pressed forward.
A body of My troops, including a small corps of mounted infantry raised from the inhabitants of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, has been disembarked at Obbia, in Italian Somaliland, to operate against the Mullah Abdullah, and an advance inland is about to be made. The co-operation of the Italian Government in this undertaking has been most cordial, and I trust that as a result of these operations the tribes of both Protectorates may be secured from further molestation.
The progress of events in South Africa has been satisfactory. The visit of the Secretary of State for the Colonies to that portion of My dominions has already been productive of the happiest results; and the opportunity which it has provided for personal conference with Lord Milner, with the Ministers of the self-governing Colonies, and with the representatives of all interests and opinions, has greatly conduced to the smooth adjustment of many difficult questions, and to the removal of many occasions of misunderstanding.
It has been found necessary to send an expedition to Kano in consequence of the hostile action of the Emir of that place. My troops have successfully occupied his capital, and I trust that it will now become possible to proceed in safety with the delimitation of the boundary between My territory of Northern Nigeria and the adjoining possessions of the French Republic. Papers upon this subject will at once be presented.
My succession to the Imperial Crown of India has been proclaimed and celebrated in an assembly of unexampled splendour at Delhi. I there received from the feudatory Princes and Chiefs, and from all classes of the peoples within My Indian dominions, gratifying marks of their loyalty and devotion to My Throne and family. I am glad to be able to state that this imposing ceremony has coincided, in point of time, with the disappearance of drought and agricultural distress in Western India, and that the prospects both of agriculture and commerce throughout My Indian Empire are more encouraging and satisfactory than they have been for some years past.
Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
The Estimates for the coming year will be laid before you. Although they have been framed with due regard to economy, the needs of the Country and of the Empire make a large expenditure inevitable.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
A Bill will be laid before you which will, I trust, complete the series of measures which have already done much to substitute single ownership for the costly and unsatisfactory conditions still attaching to the Tenure of Agricultural Land over a large portion of Ireland.
Proposals will be submitted to you for completing the scheme of Educational Reform passed last session by extending and adapting it to the Metropolitan area.
Measures will be introduced for the purpose of carrying into effect engagements arising out of the Convention for the Abolition of Bounties on Sugar which has recently been ratified at Brussels; and for guaranteeing a Loan to be raised for the Development of My new Colonies in South Africa.
A Bill will be laid before you for Improving the Administration of the Port and Docks of London, the condition of which is a matter of National concern.
A measure Amending and Consolidating the Licensing Laws in Scotland is greatly desired in that country, and I trust will pass into Law.
Measures will also be proposed to you for Improving the Law of Valuation and Assessment; for Regulating the Employment of Children; for dealing with the Sale of Adulterated Dairy Produce; for Amending the Law relating to Savings Banks; and for Reconstituting the Royal Patriotic Fund Commission.
I pray that the guidance and blessing of Almighty God may direct all your labours.
"
David Taylor,"As a parent of four daughters in full-time education and as one who was once employed in the profession, it has been a pleasure and a privilege for me to be a member of school governing bodies in north-west Leicestershire for more than 20 years. However, there is no comparison between those early years as a governor and now, and nor would I ever want to return to them. The role of governing bodies has changed completely following the implementation of local management of schools introduced by the Education Reform Act 1988. Every survey of governors since then has revealed the great time commitment that the job now involves and has referred to the paper mountain from central and local government and from the schools themselves.
I am delighted that the Minister for School Standards, my hon. Since her election to the House, she has used her 18 years as a teaching professional to excellent effect and she is widely respected in the world of education. She knows only too well the impact on governors of the huge changes in the culture of education during the past decade or so.
In the debate on the education White Paper, my hon. Friend said:
“We recognise the important role of governors… I am afraid that we have put a further burden on them… When the relationship between the governing body and the school is right, it is a tower of strength for the good of the children. When it is not right and when governors feel that they are burdened down with paperwork, it is a matter for concern.
In my visits last year to all schools in north-west Leicestershire, it was clear to me that the Government have every right to be concerned. The chairs of governors of those schools—mainly village primaries—often said that they were drowning in a sea of paper. I requested this debate in an attempt to raise the profile of the issues.
Nationally, there are more than 300,000 governors and they are a huge and valuable resource. However, there is a risk that, as unpaid volunteers, they are being taken for granted and overwhelmed by consultation papers and new duties. Members of all governing bodies are increasingly concerned about the layer upon layer of additional responsibility and work that is being placed upon lay governors. Governors are unpaid volunteers: although they can reclaim expenses for expenditure incurred on behalf of the school, few do so because they are concerned about additional costs on already stretched school budgets. It might seem surprising, but many new governors are still not aware of the commitment and responsibilities that come with being a governor, while more experienced governors feel that they cannot commit more and more time to doing justice to their role. Recently, there has been a much higher turnover of governors in my part of the world, and we are not unique.
The issue is not merely the call on the time of governors—time which so far has been willingly and freely given: there is an enormous information overload. ​ The continuing inflow of documents for the attention of chairs and members of governing bodies is reaching alarming proportions and is a disincentive for people either to take on, or to continue with, the role of governor. A cursory glance at the commitments for school responses in Leicestershire last term, and for some due early in the current term, reveals eight major consultations by the local education authority: on educational development, lifelong learning, behaviour support, nutritional standards for school meals, fair funding, key stage 1 class sizes, the new deal for schools and early-years child care. Soon, the LEA will be required to hold consultations on asset management, youth work, school organisation, special educational needs provision, youth and community education review, fair funding from April 2000 and the LEA Ofsted action plan. The Minister will appreciate what a daunting agenda that is for governing bodies and head teachers.
I do not criticise the LEAs; they are carrying out statutory responsibilities to consult and would be acting illegally if they did not do so. Central support staff in local authorities are as overwhelmed by those requirements as are governors and school staff. However, at the rate that we are going, something will have to give.
I have referred to the particular pressures of time and to the immense information overload for governors. I now turn to the issue of responsibilities. The increased responsibility in many areas requires a range and level of professionalism and expertise that few lay individuals can reasonably be expected to have. However, what is frequently demanded of governors, especially those who are chairs of governing bodies, now includes the setting of staff pay and conditions, professional development interviews and appraisal of head teachers, and, most importantly, the health and safety legal requirements. Following the delegation of health and safety issues to schools, governors have a corporate responsibility for health and safety regulation and non-compliance might constitute a criminal act that can carry severe penalties.
I have always supported increased freedom for governors in relation to schools and recognise that it brings increased responsibility. I believe that most governors are content to accept that responsibility. However, they are volunteers and they require training and support. Local education authorities are under a specific duty to provide governor training. In Leicestershire, that is very well handled within the limited resources available, but that is not necessarily the case elsewhere. One of the difficulties in providing up-to-date and effective training and support is that guidance material on recent educational initiatives is not as full or as available as would be ideal, nor are the resources typically available to LEAs for such matters anywhere near the levels necessary to help optimise governors’ contributions to driving up standards.
The three key roles of governors remain to provide a strategic view, to act as a critical friend and to ensure accountability. The day-to-day pressures are such that the urgent can too often drive out the important. It is easy to forget that one’s original intention was to drain the swamp when one is up to one’s ears in alligators. Many of the extra pressures on governors that I have described developed in the years following the Education Reform Act 1988, but the past 20 months have posed additional challenges for school governing bodies through the major new duties placed on them.
The Labour Government brought into force certain provisions of the previous Government’s Education Act 1997. The new duties now placed on governing bodies include the requirement to make arrangements to adopt a baseline assessment scheme for pupils entering primary education. Governing bodies must now adopt curriculum tests and public examination schemes with locally defined annual targets. There is a new duty on governing bodies and head teachers to provide careers education in years 9 to 11.
Finally, under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, governing bodies are required to ensure that schools meet limits on the size of infant classes; they must conduct the school with a view to promoting higher standards of educational achievement; they must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State on determining the capability of members of staff; they must set annual school attendance targets; they must adopt a home-school agreement and take reasonable steps to ensure that the parental declaration relating to such agreements is signed by every parent; and they must ensure that any school lunches comply with regulations prescribing nutritional standards.
There is an additional duty, to which I have already referred, relating to health and safety of persons on school premises, or taking part in any school activities elsewhere. A recent tragedy in Leicestershire underlines the importance of that new responsibility. I have outlined only a few of the new duties to illustrate the extra challenges posed for governors.
Notwithstanding the changing priorities and despite the limitations on time and resources, the predominant role of any school governing body should be a strategic one. Governors constantly strive to establish high expectations, challenge complacency and provide a practical policy framework within which the school can thrive. However, the key to that is surely to have every post on the governing body filled, some continuity of local and national policies and properly resourced support from the LEA or school.
Governing is a commitment which, if carried out properly, consumes many hours of precious time. Governors are expected to share responsibility for the safe and efficient running of the school. Many governors are in full-time employment and find it difficult to persuade their employers to allow them time away from work to fulfil their widening duties. Some governors have to use days from their precious annual holidays to do that, which compromises their commitments to their own families.
At local schools, governor visits are often used to monitor and evaluate curricular work in the school—in my area, the literacy hour is under review this year. Monitoring and evaluating the curriculum is an area in which governors often feel out of their depth. It is very time consuming if it is to be done properly.
The pressures on chairs of governors are heavy; at different times, I was chair of a small village primary school and of a large upper school. As chair, one’s work load is clearly much larger than that of other governors. One is in daily contact with the head teacher to give support, with frequent meetings to discuss special needs, budgets and new directives, to fill in consultation documents, or to consider admissions. The chair probably tries to summarise all the documents coming into the school to make things easier for the other governors. One must often produce much of the governors’ report to ​ parents and write letters to the local authority when one does not agree with its decisions. One must make and consider suggestions for the school’s development plan—the list goes on.
That would have given governors and teachers time to consolidate and improve the new skills that they had had to acquire during the previous 10 years. No one expects the world to stop for them, however, especially when social and economic change is so rapid. Our new Government, with an ambitious agenda to fulfil, produced even more pressure. I was delighted that our top campaign priority was education and that education is a main focus of our actions in government. Nevertheless, we absolutely must carry governors with us. The voluntary commitment of governors is already heavy and the hours are extensive. Many governors feel that even more delegation is undesirable and that governing bodies have been given enough powers and responsibilities to absorb. More paid staff, either in schools or in LEAs, are required to support the governor’s role.
When it was known that I had been successful in securing the debate, I received some feedback from local governors with a substantial number of letters, faxes, phone calls and visits from schools in the county of Leicestershire. We should bear in mind that many of those people have performed that role for a decade and more. They have experienced all the changes made by successive Governments and are not harking back to some illusory golden era of governing. I shall quote briefly from that correspondence. The chair of governors at a small village primary school says:
“We are now implementing the various initiatives detailed in the School Standards and Framework Act. I am increasingly concerned that the governor work load is going to become prohibitive. In addition, the increase in governor responsibility and accountability does not seem commensurate with the voluntary nature of serving as a school governor.
I do not think that remuneration for governors—as has been suggested occasionally—is the answer. I do, however, feel that governors are becoming a free substitute for the education authority professionals who are rapidly disappearing as more and more services and administration are devolved into schools.
Aside from the increased role of governors, this devolution of services puts extreme pressure on the staff of small schools.”
A second letter states:
“It is slightly alarming to note the rapid way in which the role of school governor has changed over the last year—it may be increasingly difficult to find people who are willing to take on this job in the future.”
Another letter says:
“I have been Chair of a local primary school for the past 18 months. During this time, we as a governing body have seen the amount of our work load increase tremendously. The sheer weight of documentation that comes through from the DfEE and the LEA is such that I do not have time to read it all… I am aware that many of my colleagues find themselves equally beleaguered. We ​ find ourselves having to concentrate on the everyday issues of running the school rather than focusing on strategic issues and those directly affecting the children within our school.
I became a governor because I cared about my children’s education. I now find myself dealing with a whole array of issues which have little or nothing to do with that education.
I have to take responsibility for keeping them warm, safe, fed and partially educated at home. The balance of their education should be provided at school but governors cannot focus on that crucial part because they are too engrossed in the new bureaucracy of governor accountability. Frankly, it is labour on the cheap. Please help”.
I pass on to my hon. Friend the Minister that poignant and heartfelt plea.
As a governor in and the Member of Parliament for a constituency containing 50 schools and 12,000 children, I urge the Minister to recognise governors’ problems and give them encouragement about the Government’s support for them and reassurance about their future role. The weight of work and worry that we are transferring to volunteer governors seems neither sensible nor sustainable. We cannot go on like this.
I am grateful to the Whips for carving out so much time for the Minister to respond to a crucial issue. I look forward to her speech with great interest.
"
James K. Polk,"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
The annual meeting of Congress is always an interesting event. The representatives of the States and of the people come fresh from their constituents to take counsel together for the common good.
After an existence of near three-fourths of a century as a free and independent Republic, the problem no longer remains to be solved whether man is capable of self-government. The success of our admirable system is a conclusive refutation of the theories of those in other countries who maintain that a ""favored few"" are born to rule and that the mass of mankind must be governed by force. Subject to no arbitrary or hereditary authority, the people are the only sovereigns recognized by our Constitution.
Numerous emigrants, of every lineage and language, attracted by the civil and religious freedom we enjoy and by our happy condition, annually crowd to our shores, and transfer their heart, not less than their allegiance, to the country whose dominion belongs alone to the people. No country has been so much favored, or should acknowledge with deeper reverence the manifestations of the divine protection. An all wise Creator directed and guarded us in our infant struggle for freedom and has constantly watched over our surprising progress until we have become one of the great nations of the earth.
It is in a country thus favored, and under a Government in which the executive and legislative branches hold their authority for limited periods alike from the people, and where all are responsible to their respective constituencies, that it is again my duty to communicate with Congress upon the state of the Union and the present condition of public affairs.
During the past year the most gratifying proofs are presented that our country has been blessed with a widespread and universal prosperity. There has been no period since the Government was founded when all the industrial pursuits of our people have been more successful or when labor in all branches of business has received a fairer or better reward. From our abundance we have been enabled to perform the pleasing duty of furnishing food for the starving millions of less favored countries.
In the enjoyment of the bounties of Providence at home such as have rarely fallen to the lot of any people, it is cause of congratulation that our intercourse with all the powers of the earth except Mexico continues to be of an amicable character.
It has ever been our cherished policy to cultivate peace and good will with all nations, and this policy has been steadily pursued by me. No change has taken place in our relations with Mexico since the adjournment of the last Congress. The war in which the United States were forced to engage with the Government of that country still continues.
I deem it unnecessary, after the full exposition of them contained in my message of the 11th of May, 1846, and in my annual message at the commencement of the session of Congress in December last, to reiterate the serious causes of complaint which we had against Mexico before she commenced hostilities.
It is sufficient on the present occasion to say that the wanton violation of the rights of person and property of our citizens committed by Mexico, her repeated acts of bad faith through a long series of years, and her disregard of solemn treaties stipulating for indemnity to our injured citizens not only constituted ample cause of war on our part, but were of such an aggravated character as would have justified us before the whole world in resorting to this extreme remedy. With an anxious desire to avoid a rupture between the two countries, we forbore for years to assert our clear rights by force, and continued to seek redress for the wrongs we had suffered by amicable negotiation in the hope that Mexico might yield to pacific counsels and the demands of justice. In this hope we were disappointed. Our minister of peace sent to Mexico was insultingly rejected. The Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly unjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war by invading the territory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil.
Though the United States were the aggrieved nation, Mexico commenced the war, and we were compelled in self-defense to repel the invader and to vindicate the national honor and interests by prosecuting it with vigor until we could obtain a just and honorable peace. On learning that hostilities had been commenced by Mexico I promptly communicated that fact, accompanied with a succinct statement of our other causes of complaint against Mexico, to Congress, and that body, by the act of the 13th of May, 1846, declared that ""by the act of the Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between that Government and the United States."" This act declaring ""the war to exist by the act of the Republic of Mexico,"" and making provision for its prosecution ""to a speedy and successful termination,"" was passed with great unanimity by Congress, there being but two negative votes in the Senate and but fourteen in the House of Representatives.
The existence of the war having thus been declared by Congress, it became my duty under the Constitution and the laws to conduct and prosecute it. This duty has been performed, and though at every stage of its progress I have manifested a willingness to terminate it by a just peace, Mexico has refused to accede to any terms which could be accepted by the United States consistently with the national honor and interest.
The rapid and brilliant successes of our arms and the vast extent of the enemy's territory which had been overrun and conquered before the close of the last session of Congress were fully known to that body. Since that time the war has been prosecuted with increased energy, and, I am gratified to state, with a success which commands universal admiration.. History presents no parallel of so many glorious victories achieved by any nation within so short a period. Our Army, regulars and volunteers, have covered themselves with imperishable honors. Whenever and wherever our forces have encountered the enemy, though he was in vastly superior numbers and often intrenched in fortified positions of his own selection and of great strength, he has been defeated. Too much praise can not be bestowed upon our officers and men, regulars and volunteers, for their gallantry, discipline, indomitable courage, and perseverance, all seeking the post of danger and vying with each other in deeds of noble daring.
While every patriot's heart must exult and a just national pride animate every bosom in beholding the high proofs of courage, consummate military skill, steady discipline, and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibited by our gallant Army, the nation is called to mourn over the loss of many brave officers and soldiers, who have fallen in defense of their country's honor and interests. The brave dead met their melancholy fate in a foreign land, nobly discharging their duty, and with their country's flag waving triumphantly in the face of the foe. Their patriotic deeds are justly appreciated, and will long be remembered by their grateful countrymen. The parental care of the Government they loved and served should be extended to their surviving families.
Shortly after the adjournment of the last session of Congress the gratifying intelligence was received of the signal victory of Buena Vista, and of the fall of the city of Vera Cruz, and with it the strong castle of San Juan de Ulloa, by which it was defended. Believing that after these and other successes so honorable to our arms and so disastrous to Mexico the period was propitious to afford her another opportunity, if she thought proper to embrace it, to enter into negotiations for peace, a commissioner was appointed to proceed to the headquarters of our Army with full powers to enter upon negotiations and to conclude a just and honorable treaty of peace. He was not directed to make any new overtures of peace, but was the bearer of a dispatch from the Secretary of State of the United States to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, in reply to one received from the latter of the 22d of February, 1847, in which the Mexican Government was informed of his appointment and of his presence at the headquarters of our Army, and that he was invested with full powers to conclude a definitive treaty of peace whenever the Mexican Government might signify a desire to do so. While I was unwilling to subject the United States to another indignant refusal, I was yet resolved that the evils of the war should not be protracted a day longer than might be rendered absolutely necessary by the Mexican Government.
Care was taken to give no instructions to the commissioner which could in any way interfere with our military operations or relax our energies in the prosecution of the war. He possessed no authority in any manner to control these operations. He was authorized to exhibit his instructions to the general in command of the Army, and in the event of a treaty being concluded and ratified on the part of Mexico he was directed to give him notice of that fact. On the happening of such contingency, and on receiving notice thereof, the general in command was instructed by the Secretary of War to suspend further active military operations until further orders. These instructions were given with a view to intermit hostilities until the treaty thus ratified by Mexico could be transmitted to Washington and receive the action of the Government of the United States. The commissioner was also directed on reaching the Army to deliver to the general in command the dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, and on receiving it the general was instructed by the Secretary of War to cause it to be transmitted to the commander of the Mexican forces, with a quest that it might be communicated to his Government. The commissioner did not reach the headquarters of the Army until after another brilliant victory had crowned our arms at Cerro Gordo. The dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of War to the general in command of the Army was received by that officer, then at Jalapa, on the 7th of May, 1847, together with the dispatch from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, having been transmitted to him from Vera Cruz. The commissioner arrived at the headquarters of the Army a few days afterwards. His presence with the Army and his diplomatic character were made known to the Mexican Government from Puebla on the 12th of June, 1847, by the transmission of the dispatch from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico.
Many weeks elapsed after its receipt, and no overtures were made nor was any desire expressed by the Mexican Government to enter into negotiations for peace.
Our Army pursued its march upon the capital, and as it approached it was met by formidable resistance. Our forces first encountered the enemy, and achieved signal victories in the severely contested battles of Contreras and Churubusco. It was not until after these actions had resulted in decisive victories and the capital of the enemy was within our power that the Mexican Government manifested any disposition to enter into negotiations for peace, and even then, as events have proved, there is too much reason to believe they were insincere, and that in agreeing to go through the forms of negotiation the object was to gain time to strengthen the defenses of their capital and to prepare for fresh resistance.
The general in command of the Army deemed it expedient to suspend hostilities temporarily by entering into an armistice with a view to the opening of negotiations. Commissioners were appointed on the part of Mexico to meet the commissioner on the part of the United States. The result of the conferences which took place between these functionaries of the two Governments was a failure to conclude a treaty of peace. The commissioner of the United States took with him the project of a treaty already prepared, by the terms of which the indemnity required by the United States was a cession of territory.
It is well known that the only indemnity which it is in the power of Mexico to make in satisfaction of the just and long-deferred claims of our citizens against her and the only means by which she can reimburse the United States for the expenses of the war is a cession to the United States of a portion of her territory. Mexico has no money to pay, and no other means of making the required indemnity. If we refuse this, we can obtain nothing else. To reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of territory would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object.
A state of war abrogates treaties previously existing between the belligerents and a treaty of peace puts an end to all claims for indemnity for tortious acts committed under the authority of one government against the citizens or subjects of another unless they are provided for in its stipulations. A treaty of peace which would terminate the existing war without providing for indemnity would enable Mexico, the acknowledged debtor and herself the aggressor in the war, to relieve herself from her just liabilities. By such a treaty our citizens who hold just demands against her would have no remedy either against Mexico or their own Government. Our duty to these citizens must forever prevent such a peace, and no treaty which does not provide ample means of discharging these demands can receive my sanction.
A treaty of peace should settle all existing differences between the two countries. If an adequate cession of territory should be made by such a treaty, the United States should release Mexico from all her liabilities and assume their payment to our own citizens. If instead of this the United States were to consent to a treaty by which Mexico should again engage to pay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to our Government and our citizens would impose on her, it is notorious that she does not possess the means to meet such an undertaking. From such a treaty no result could be anticipated but the same irritating disappointments which have heretofore attended the violations of similar treaty stipulations on the part of Mexico. Such a treaty would be but a temporary cessation of hostilities, without the restoration of the friendship and good understanding which should characterize the future intercourse between the two countries.
That Congress contemplated the acquisition of territorial indemnity when that body made provision for the prosecution of the war is obvious. Congress could not have meant when, in May, 1846, they appropriated $10,000,000 and authorized the President to employ the militia and naval and military forces of the United States and to accept the services of 50,000 volunteers to enable him to prosecute the war, and when, at their last session, and after our Army had invaded Mexico, they made additional appropriations and authorized the raising of additional troops for the same purpose, that no indemnity was to be obtained from Mexico at the conclusion of the war; and yet it was certain that if no Mexican territory was acquired no indemnity could be obtained. It is further manifest that Congress contemplated territorial indemnity from the fact that at their last session an act was passed, upon the Executive recommendation, appropriating $3,000,000 with that express object. This appropriation was made ""to enable the President to conclude a treaty of peace, limits, and boundaries with the Republic of Mexico, to be used by him in the event that said treaty, when signed by the authorized agents of the two Governments and duly ratified by Mexico, shall call for the expenditure of the same or any part thereof."" The object of asking this appropriation was distinctly stated in the several messages on the subject which I communicated to Congress. Similar appropriations made in 1803 and 1806, which were referred to, were intended to be applied in part consideration for the cession of Louisiana and the Floridas. In like manner it was anticipated that in settling the terms of a treaty of ""limits and boundaries"" with Mexico a cession of territory estimated to be of greater value than the amount of our demands against her might be obtained, and that the prompt payment of this sum in part consideration for the territory ceded, on the conclusion of a treaty and its ratification on her part, might be an inducement with her to make such a cession of territory as would be satisfactory to the United States; and although the failure to conclude such a treaty has rendered it unnecessary to use any part of the $3,000,000 appropriated by that act, and the entire sum remains in the Treasury, it is still applicable to that object should the contingency occur making such application proper.
The doctrine of no territory is the doctrine of no indemnity, and if sanctioned would be a public acknowledgment that our country was wrong and that the war declared by Congress with extraordinary unanimity was unjust and should be abandoned--an admission unfounded in fact and degrading to the national character.
The terms of the treaty proposed by the United States were not only just to Mexico, but, considering the character and amount of our claims, the unjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostilities by her, the expenses of the war to which we have been subjected, and the success which had attended our arms, were deemed to be of a most liberal character.
The commissioner of the United States was authorized to agree to the establishment of the Rio Grande as the boundary from its entrance into the Gulf to its intersection with the southern boundary of New Mexico, in north latitude about 32 degree, and to obtain a cession to the United States of the Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias and the privilege of the right of way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The boundary of the Rio Grande and the cession to the United States of New Mexico and Upper California constituted an ultimatum which our commissioner was under no circumstances to yield.
That it might be manifest, not only to Mexico, but to all other nations, that the United States were not disposed to take advantage of a feeble power by insisting upon wrestling from her all the other Provinces, including many of her principal towns and cities, which we had conquered and held in our military occupation but were willing to conclude a treaty in a spirit of liberality, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the restoration to Mexico of all our other conquests.
As the territory to be acquired by the boundary proposed might be estimated to be of greater value than a fair equivalent for our just demands, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the payment of such additional pecuniary consideration as was deemed reasonable.
The terms of a treaty proposed by the Mexican commissioners were wholly inadmissible. They negotiated as if Mexico were the victorious, and not the vanquished, party. They must have known that their ultimatum could never be accepted. It required the United States to dismember Texas by surrendering to Mexico that part of the territory of that State lying between the Nueces and the Rio Grande, included within her limits by her laws when she was an independent republic, and when she was annexed to the United States and admitted by Congress as one of the States of our Union. It contained no provision for the payment by Mexico of the just claims of our citizens. It required indemnity to Mexican citizens for injuries they may have sustained by our troops in the prosecution of the war. It demanded the right for Mexico to levy and collect the Mexican tariff of duties on goods imported into her ports while in our military occupation during the war, and the owners of which had paid to officers of the United States the military contributions which had been levied upon them; and it offered to cede to the United States, for a pecuniary consideration, that part of Upper California lying north of latitude 37&deg;. Such were the unreasonable terms proposed by the Mexican commissioners.
The cession to the United States by Mexico of the Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias, as proposed by the commissioner of the United States, it was believed would be more in accordance with the convenience and interests of both nations than any other cession of territory which it was probable Mexico could be induced to make.
It is manifest to all who have observed the actual condition of the Mexican Government for some years past and at present that if these Provinces should be retained by her she could not long continue to hold and govern them. Mexico is too feeble a power to govern these Provinces, lying as they do at a distance of more than 1,000 miles from her capital, and if attempted to be retained by her they would constitute but for a short time even nominally a part of her dominions. This would be especially the case with Upper California.
The sagacity of powerful European nations has long since directed their attention to the commercial importance of that Province, and there can be little doubt that the moment the United States shall relinquish their present occupation of it and their claim to it as indemnity an effort would be made by some foreign power to possess it, either by conquest or by purchase. If no foreign government should acquire it in either of these modes, an independent revolutionary government would probably be established by the inhabitants and such foreigners as may remain in or remove to the country as soon as it shall be known that the United States have abandoned it. Such a government would be too feeble long to maintain its separate independent existence, and would finally become annexed to or be a dependent colony of some more powerful state. Should any foreign government attempt to possess it as a colony, or otherwise to incorporate it with itself, the principle avowed by President Monroe in 1824, and reaffirmed in my first annual message, that no foreign power shall with our consent be permitted to plant or establish any new colony or dominion on any part of the North American continent must be maintained. In maintaining this principle and in resisting its invasion by any foreign power we might be involved in other wars more expensive and more difficult than that in which we are now engaged. The Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias are contiguous to the territories of the United States, and if brought under the government of our laws their resources--mineral, agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial--would soon be developed.
Upper California is bounded on the north by our Oregon possessions, and if held by the United States would soon be settled by a hardy, enterprising, and intelligent portion of our population. The Bay of San Francisco and other harbors along the Californian coast would afford shelter for our Navy, for our numerous whale ships, and other merchant vessels employed in the Pacific Ocean, and would in a short period become the marts of an extensive and profitable commerce with China and other countries of the East.
These advantages, in which the whole commercial world would participate, would at once be secured to the United States by the cession of this territory; while it is certain that as long as it remains a part of the Mexican dominions they can be enjoyed neither by Mexico herself nor by any other nation.
New Mexico is a frontier Province, and has never been of any considerable value to Mexico. From its locality it is naturally connected with our Western settlements. The territorial limits of the State of Texas, too, as defined by her laws before her admission into our Union, embrace all that portion of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande, while Mexico still claims to hold this territory as a part of her dominions. The adjustment of this question of boundary is important.
There is another consideration which induced the belief that the Mexican Government might even desire to place this Province under the protection of the Government of the United States. Numerous bands of fierce and warlike savages wander over it and upon its borders. Mexico has been and must continue to be too feeble to restrain them from committing depredations, robberies, and murders, not only upon the inhabitants of New Mexico itself, but upon those of the other northern States of Mexico. It would be a blessing to all these northern States to have their citizens protected against them by the power of the United States. At this moment many Mexicans, principally females and children, are in captivity among them. If New Mexico were held and governed by the United States, we could effectually prevent these tribes from committing such outrages, and compel them to release these captives and restore them to their families and friends.
In proposing to acquire New Mexico and the Californias, it was known that but an inconsiderable portion of the Mexican people would be transferred with them, the country embraced within these Provinces being chiefly an uninhabited region.
These were the leading considerations which induced me to authorize the terms of peace which were proposed to Mexico. They were rejected, and, negotiations being at an end, hostilities were renewed. An assault was made by our gallant Army upon the strongly fortified places near the gates of the City of Mexico and upon the city itself, and after several days of severe conflict the Mexican forces, vastly superior in number to our own, were driven from the city, and it was occupied by our troops.
Immediately after information was received of the unfavorable result of the negotiations, believing that his continued presence with the Army could be productive of no good, I determined to recall our commissioner. A dispatch to this effect was transmitted to him on the 6th of October last. The Mexican Government will be informed of his recall, and that in the existing state of things I shall not deem it proper to make any further overtures of peace, but shall be at all times ready to receive and consider any proposals which may be made by Mexico.
Since the liberal proposition of the United States was authorized to be made, in April last, large expenditures have been incurred and the precious blood of many of our patriotic fellow-citizens has been shed in the prosecution of the war. This consideration and the obstinate perseverance of Mexico in protracting the war must influence the terms of peace which it may be deemed proper hereafter to accept. Our arms having been everywhere victorious, having subjected to our military occupation a large portion of the enemy's country, including his capital, and negotiations for peace having failed, the important questions arise, in what manner the war ought to be prosecuted and what should be our future policy. I can not doubt that we should secure and render available the conquests which we have already made, and that with this view we should hold and occupy by our naval and military forces all the ports, towns, cities, and Provinces now in our occupation or which may hereafter fall into our possession; that we should press forward our military operations and levy such military contributions on the enemy as may, as far as practicable, defray the future expenses of the war.
Had the Government of Mexico acceded to the equitable and liberal terms proposed, that mode of adjustment would have been preferred, Mexico having declined to do this and failed to offer any other terms which could be accepted by the United States, the national honor, no less than the public interests, requires that the war should be prosecuted with increased energy and power until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtained. In the meantime, as Mexico refuses all indemnity, we should adopt measures to indemnify ourselves by appropriating permanently a portion of her territory. Early after the commencement of the war New Mexico and the Californias were taken possession of by our forces. Our military and naval commanders were ordered to conquer and hold them, subject to be disposed of by a treaty of peace.
These Provinces are now in our undisputed occupation, and have been so for many months, all resistance on the part of Mexico having ceased within their limits. I am satisfied that they should never be surrendered to Mexico. Should Congress concur with me in this opinion, and that they should be retained by the United States as indemnity, I can perceive no good reason why the civil jurisdiction and laws of the United States should not at once be extended over them. To wait for a treaty of peace such as we are willing to make, by which our relations toward them would not be changed, can not be good policy; whilst our own interest and that of the people inhabiting them require that a stable, responsible, and free government under our authority should as soon as possible be established over them. Should Congress, therefore, determine to hold these Provinces permanently, and that they shall hereafter be considered as constituent parts of our country, the early establishment of Territorial governments over them will be important for the more perfect protection of persons and property; and I recommend that such Territorial governments be established. It will promote peace and tranquillity among the inhabitants, by allaying all apprehension that they may still entertain of being again subjected to the jurisdiction of Mexico. I invite the early and favorable consideration of Congress to this important subject.
Besides New Mexico and the Californias, there are other Mexican Provinces which have been reduced to our possession by conquest. These other Mexican Provinces are now governed by our military and naval commanders under the general authority which is conferred upon a conqueror by the laws of war. They should continue to be held, as a means of coercing Mexico to accede to just terms of peace. Civil as well as military officers are required to conduct such a government. Adequate compensation, to be drawn from contributions levied on the enemy, should be fixed by law for such officers as may be thus employed. What further provision may become necessary and what final disposition it may be proper to make of them must depend on the future progress of the war and the course which Mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue.
With the views I entertain I can not favor the policy which has been suggested, either to withdraw our Army altogether or to retire to a designated line and simply hold and defend it. To withdraw our Army altogether from the conquests they have made by deeds of unparalleled bravery, and at the expense of so much blood and treasure, in a just war on our part, and one which, by the act of the enemy, we could not honorably have avoided, would be to degrade the nation in its own estimation and in that of the world. To retire to a line and simply hold and defend it would not terminate the war. On the contrary, it would encourage Mexico to persevere and tend to protract it indefinitely. It is not to be expected that Mexico, after refusing to establish such a line as a permanent boundary when our victorious Army are in possession of her capital and in the heart of her country, would permit us to hold it without resistance. That she would continue the war, and in the most harassing and annoying forms, there can be no doubt. A border warfare of the most savage character, extending over a long line, would be unceasingly waged. It would require a large army to be kept constantly in the field, stationed at posts and garrisons along such a line, to protect and defend it. The enemy, relieved from the pressure of our arms on his coasts and in the populous parts of the interior, would direct his attention to this line, and, selecting an isolated post for attack, would concentrate his forces upon it. This would be a condition of affairs which the Mexicans, pursuing their favorite system of guerrilla warfare, would probably prefer to any other. Were we to assume a defensive attitude on such a line, all the advantages of such a state of war would be on the side of the enemy. We could levy no contributions upon him, or in any other way make him feel the pressure of the war, but must remain inactive and await his approach, being in constant uncertainty at what point on the line or at what time he might make an assault. He may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the interior on his own side of the line, and, concealing his purpose, make a sudden assault upon some one of our posts so distant from any other as to prevent the possibility of timely succor or reenforcements, and in this way our gallant Army would be exposed to the danger of being cut off in detail; or if by their unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere exhibited during this war they should repulse the enemy, their numbers stationed at any one post may be too small to pursue him. If the enemy be repulsed in one attack, he would have nothing to do but to retreat to his own side of the line, and, being in no fear of a pursuing army, may reenforce himself at leisure for another attack on the same or some other post. He may, too, cross the line between our posts, make rapid incursions into the country which we hold, murder the inhabitants, commit depredations on them, and then retreat to the interior before a sufficient force can be concentrated to pursue him. Such would probably be the harassing character of a mere defensive war on our part. If our forces when attacked, or threatened with attack, be permitted to cross the line, drive back the enemy, and conquer him, this would be again to invade the enemy's country after having lost all the advantages of the conquests we have already made by having voluntarily abandoned them. To hold such a line successfully and in security it is far from being certain that it would not require as large an army as would be necessary to hold all the conquests we have already made and to continue the prosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy's country. It is also far from being certain that the expenses of the war would be diminished by such a policy. I am persuaded that the best means of vindicating the national honor and interest and of bringing the war to an honorable close will be to prosecute it with increased energy and power in the vital parts of the enemy's country.
In my annual message to Congress of December last I declared that-- The war has not been waged with a view to conquest, but, having been commenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy's country and will be vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable peace, and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war, as well as to our much-injured citizens, who hold large pecuniary demands against Mexico.
Such, in my judgment, continues to be our true policy; indeed, the only policy which will probably secure a permanent peace.
It has never been contemplated by me, as an object of the war, to make a permanent conquest of the Republic of Mexico or to annihilate her separate existence as an independent nation. On the contrary, it has ever been my desire that she should maintain her nationality, and under a good government adapted to her condition be a free, independent, and prosperous Republic. The United States were the first among the nations to recognize her independence, and have always desired to be on terms of amity and good neighborhood with her. This she would not suffer. By her own conduct we have been compelled to engage in the present war. In its prosecution we seek not her overthrow as a nation, but in vindicating our national honor we seek to obtain redress for the wrongs she has done us and indemnity for our just demands against her. We demand an honorable peace, and that peace must bring with it indemnity for the past and security for the future. Hitherto Mexico has refused all accommodation by which such a peace could be obtained.
Whilst our armies have advanced from victory to victory from the commencement of the war, it has always been with the olive branch of peace in their hands, and it has been in the power of Mexico at every step to arrest hostilities by accepting it.
One great obstacle to the attainment of peace has undoubtedly arisen from the fact that Mexico has been so long held in subjection by one faction or military usurper after another, and such has been the condition of insecurity in which their successive governments have been placed that each has been deterred from making peace lest for this very cause a rival faction might expel it from power. Such was the fate of President Herrera's administration in 1845 for being disposed even to listen to the overtures of the United States to prevent the war, as is fully confirmed by an official correspondence which took place in the month of August last between him and his Government, a copy of which is herewith communicated. ""For this cause alone the revolution which displaced him from power was set on foot"" by General Paredes. Such may be the condition of insecurity of the present Government.
There can be no doubt that the peaceable and well-disposed inhabitants of Mexico are convinced that it is the true interest of their country to conclude an honorable peace with the United States, but the apprehension of becoming the victims of some military faction or usurper may have prevented them from manifesting their feelings by any public act. The removal of any such apprehension would probably cause them to speak their sentiments freely and to adopt the measures necessary for the restoration of peace. With a people distracted and divided by contending factions and a Government subject to constant changes by successive revolutions, the continued successes of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace. In such event it may become proper for our commanding generals in the field to give encouragement and assurances of protection to the friends of peace in Mexico in the establishment and maintenance of a free republican government of their own choice, able and willing to conclude a peace which would be just to them and secure to us the indemnity we demand. This may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace. Should such be the result, the war which Mexico has forced upon us would thus be converted into an enduring blessing to herself. After finding her torn and distracted by factions, and ruled by military usurpers, we should then leave her with a republican government in the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and prosperity, performing all her relative duties in the great family of nations and promoting her own happiness by wise laws and their faithful execution.
If, after affording this encouragement and protection, and after all the persevering and sincere efforts we have made from the moment Mexico commenced the war, and prior to that time, to adjust our differences with her, we shall ultimately fail, then we shall have exhausted all honorable means in pursuit of peace, and must continue to occupy her country with our troops, taking the full measure of indemnity into our own hands, and must enforce the terms which our honor demands.
To act otherwise in the existing state of things in Mexico, and to withdraw our Army without a peace, would not only leave all the wrongs of which we complain unredressed, but would be the signal for new and fierce civil dissensions and new revolutions--all alike hostile to peaceful relations with the United States. Besides, there is danger, if our troops were withdrawn before a peace was conducted, that the Mexican people, wearied with successive revolutions and deprived of protection for their persons and property, might at length be inclined to yield to foreign influences and to cast themselves into the arms of some European monarch for protection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue. This, for our own safety and in pursuance of our established policy, we should be compelled to resist. We could never consent that Mexico should be thus converted into a monarchy governed by a foreign prince.
Mexico is our near neighbor, and her boundaries are coterminous with our own through the whole extent across the North American continent, from ocean to ocean. Both politically and commercially we have the deepest interest in her regeneration and prosperity. Indeed, it is impossible that, with any just regard to our own safety, we can ever become indifferent to her fate.
It may be that the Mexican Government and people have misconstrued or misunderstood our forbearance and our objects in desiring to conclude an amicable adjustment of the existing differences between the two countries. They may have supposed that we would submit to terms degrading to the nation, or they may have drawn false inferences from the supposed division of opinion in the United States on the subject of the war, and may have calculated to gain much by protracting it, and, indeed, that we might ultimately abandon it altogether without insisting on any indemnity, territorial or otherwise. Whatever may be the false impressions under which they have acted, the adoption and prosecution of the energetic policy proposed must soon undeceive them.
In the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be made to feel its pressure more than they have heretofore done. At its commencement it was deemed proper to conduct it in a spirit of forbearance and liberality. With this end in view, early measures were adopted to conciliate, as far as a state of war would permit, the mass of the Mexican population; to convince them that the war was waged, not against the peaceful inhabitants of Mexico, but against their faithless Government, which had commenced hostilities; to remove from their minds the false impressions which their designing and interested rulers had artfully attempted to make, that the war on our part was one of conquest, that it was a war against their religion and their churches, which were to be desecrated and overthrown, and that their rights of person and private property would be violated. To remove these false impressions, our commanders in the field were directed scrupulously to respect their religion, their churches, and their church property, which were in no manner to be violated; they were directed also to respect the rights of persons and property of all who should not take up arms against us.
Assurances to this effect were given to the Mexican people by Major General Taylor in a proclamation issued in pursuance of instructions from the Secretary of War in the month of June, 1846, and again by Major-General Scott, who acted upon his own convictions of the propriety of issuing it, in a proclamation of the 11th of May, 1847. In this spirit of liberality and conciliation, and with a view to prevent the body of the Mexican population from taking up arms against us, was the war conducted on our part. Provisions and other supplies furnished to our Army by Mexican citizens were paid for at fair and liberal prices, agreed upon by the parties. After the lapse of a few months it became apparent that these assurances and this mild treatment had failed to produce the desired effect upon the Mexican population. While the war had been conducted on our part according to the most humane and liberal principles observed by civilized nations, it was waged in a far different spirit on the part of Mexico. Not appreciating our forbearance, the Mexican people generally became hostile to the United States, and availed themselves of every opportunity to commit the most savage excesses upon our troops. Large numbers of the population took up arms, and, engaging in guerrilla warfare, robbed and murdered in the most cruel manner individual soldiers or small parties whom accident or other causes had separated from the main body of our Army; bands of guerrilleros and robbers infested the roads, harassed our trains, and whenever it was in their power cut off our supplies.
The Mexicans having thus shown themselves to be wholly incapable of appreciating our forbearance and liberality, it was deemed proper to change the manner of conducting the war, by making them feel its pressure according to the usages observed under similar circumstances by all other civilized nations.
Accordingly, as early as the 22d of September, 1846, instructions were given by the Secretary of War to Major-General Taylor to ""draw supplies"" for our Army ""from the enemy without paying for them, and to require contributions for its support, if in that way he was satisfied he could get abundant supplies for his forces."" In directing the execution of these instructions much was necessarily left to the discretion of the commanding officer, who was best acquainted with the circumstances by which he was surrounded, the wants of the Army, and the practicability of enforcing the measure. General Taylor, on the 26th of October, 1846, replied from Monterey that ""it would have been impossible hitherto, and is so now, to sustain the Army to any extent by forced contributions of money or supplies."" For the reasons assigned by him, he did not adopt the policy of his instructions, but declared his readiness to do so ""should the Army in its future operations reach a portion of the country which may be made to supply the troops with advantage."" He continued to pay for the articles of supply which were drawn from the enemy's country.
Similar instructions were issued to Major-General Scott on the 3d of April, 1847, who replied from Jalapa on the 20th of May, 1847, that if it be expected ""that the Army is to support itself by forced contributions levied upon the country we may ruin and exasperate the inhabitants and starve ourselves."" The same discretion was given to him that had been to General Taylor in this respect. General Scott, for the reasons assigned by him, also continued to pay for the articles of supply for the Army which were drawn from the enemy.
After the Army had reached the heart of the most wealthy portion of Mexico it was supposed that the obstacles which had before that time prevented it would not be such as to render impracticable the levy of forced contributions for its support, and on the 1st of September and again on the 6th of October, 1847, the order was repeated in dispatches addressed by the Secretary of War to General Scott, and his attention was again called to the importance of making the enemy bear the burdens of the war by requiring them to furnish the means of supporting our Army, and he was directed to adopt this policy unless by doing so there was danger of depriving the Army of the necessary supplies. Copies of these dispatches were forwarded to General Taylor for his government.
On the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military and naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon all vessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico in our military occupation, and to apply such contributions toward defraying the expenses of the war. By virtue of the right of conquest and the laws of war, the conqueror, consulting his own safety or convenience, may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all such ports or permit it upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe. Before the principal ports of Mexico were blockaded by our Navy the revenue derived from import duties under the laws of Mexico was paid into the Mexican treasury. After these ports had fallen into our military possession the blockade was raised and commerce with them permitted upon prescribed terms and conditions. They were opened to the trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more moderate in their amount than those which had been previously levied by Mexico, and the revenue, which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury, was directed to be collected by our military and naval officers and applied to the use of our Army and Navy. Care was taken that the officers, soldiers, and sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the operations of the order, and, as the merchandise imported upon which the order operated must be consumed by Mexican citizens, the contributions exacted were in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the application of them to our own use. In directing this measure the object was to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the expenses of the war.
For the amount of contributions which have been levied in this form I refer you to the accompanying reports of the Secretary of War and of the Secretary of the Navy, by which it appears that a sum exceeding half a million of dollars has been collected. This amount would undoubtedly have been much larger but for the difficulty of keeping open communications between the coast and the interior, so as to enable the owners of the merchandise imported to transport and vend it to the inhabitants of the country. It is confidently expected that this difficulty will to a great extent be soon removed by our increased forces which have been sent to the field.
Measures have recently been adopted by which the internal as well as the external revenues of Mexico in all places in our military occupation will be seized and appropriated to the use of our Army and Navy.
The policy of levying upon the enemy contributions in every form consistently with the laws of nations, which it may be practicable for our military commanders to adopt, should, in my judgment, be rigidly enforced, and orders to this effect have accordingly been given. By such a policy, at the same time that our own Treasury will be relieved from a heavy drain, the Mexican people will be made to feel the burdens of the war, and, consulting their own interests, may be induced the more readily to require their rulers to accede to a just peace.
After the adjournment of the last session of Congress events transpired in the prosecution of the war which in my judgment required a greater number of troops in the field than had been anticipated. The strength of the Army was accordingly increased by ""accepting"" the services of all the volunteer forces authorized by the act of the 13th of May, 1846, without putting a construction on that act the correctness of which was seriously questioned. The volunteer forces now in the field, with those which had been ""accepted"" to ""serve for twelve months"" and were discharged at the end of their term of service, exhaust the 50,000 men authorized by that act. Had it been clear that a proper construction of the act warranted it, the services of an additional number would have been called for and accepted; but doubts existing upon this point, the power was not exercised. It is deemed important that Congress should at an early period of their session confer the authority to raise an additional regular force to serve during the war with Mexico and to be discharged upon the conclusion and ratification of a treaty of peace. I invite the attention of Congress to the views presented by the Secretary of War in his report upon this subject.
I recommend also that authority be given by law to call for and accept the services of an additional number of volunteers, to be exercised at such time and to such extent as the emergencies of the service may require.
In prosecuting the war with Mexico, whilst the utmost care has been taken to avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral nations, and none has been given, liberal privileges have been granted to their commerce in the ports of the enemy in our military occupation. The difficulty with the Brazilian Government, which at one time threatened to interrupt the friendly relations between the two countries, will, I trust, be speedily adjusted. I have received information that an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United States will shortly be appointed by His Imperial Majesty, and it is hoped that he will come instructed and prepared to adjust all remaining differences between the two Governments in a manner acceptable and honorable to both. In the meantime, I have every reason to believe that nothing will occur to interrupt our amicable relations with Brazil.
It has been my constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most intimate relations of friendship with all the independent powers of South America, and this policy has been attended with the happiest results. It is true that the settlement and payment of many just claims of American citizens against these nations have been long delayed. The peculiar position in which they have been placed and the desire on the part of my predecessors as well as myself to grant them the utmost indulgence have hitherto prevented these claims from being urged in a manner demanded by strict justice. The time has arrived when they ought to be finally adjusted and liquidated, and efforts are now making for that purpose.
It is proper to inform you that the Government of Peru has in good faith paid the first two installments of the indemnity of $30,000 each, and the greater portion of the interest due thereon, in execution of the convention between that Government and the United States the ratifications of which were exchanged at Lima on the 31st of October, 1846. The Attorney-General of the United States early in August last completed the adjudication of the claims under this convention, and made his report thereon in pursuance of the act of the 8th of August, 1846. The sums to which the claimants are respectively entitled will be paid on demand at the Treasury.
I invite the early attention of Congress to the present condition of our citizens in China. Under our treaty with that power American citizens are withdrawn from the jurisdiction, whether civil or criminal, of the Chinese Government and placed under that of our public functionaries in that country. By these alone can our citizens be tried and punished for the commission of any crime; by these alone can questions be decided between them involving the rights of persons and property, and by these alone can contracts be enforced into which they may have entered with the citizens or subjects of foreign powers. The merchant vessels of the United States lying in the waters of the five ports of China open to foreign commerce are under the exclusive jurisdiction of officers of their own Government. Until Congress shall establish competent tribunals to try and punish crimes and to exercise jurisdiction in civil cases in China, American citizens there are subject to no law whatever. Crimes may be committed with impunity and debts may be contracted without any means to enforce their payment. Inconveniences have already resulted from the omission of Congress to legislate upon the subject, and still greater are apprehended. The British authorities in China have already complained that this Government has not provided for the punishment of crimes or the enforcement of contracts against American citizens in that country, whilst their Government has established tribunals by which an American citizen can recover debts due from British subjects. Accustomed, as the Chinese are, to summary justice, they could not be made to comprehend why criminals who are citizens of the United States should escape with impunity, in violation of treaty obligations, whilst the punishment of a Chinese who had committed any crime against an American citizen would be rigorously exacted. Indeed, the consequences might be fatal to American citizens in China should a flagrant crime be committed by any one of them upon a Chinese, and should trial and punishment not follow according to the requisitions of the treaty. This might disturb, if not destroy, our friendly relations with that Empire, and cause an interruption of our valuable commerce. Our treaties with the Sublime Porte, Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco, and Muscat also require the legislation of Congress to carry them into execution, though the necessity for immediate action may not be so urgent as in regard to China.
The Secretary of State has submitted an estimate to defray the expense of opening diplomatic relations with the Papal States. The interesting political events now in progress in these States, as well as a just regard to our commercial interests, have, in my opinion, rendered such a measure highly expedient.
Estimates have also been submitted for the outfits and salaries of charges' d'affaires to the Republics of Bolivia, Guatemala, and Ecuador. The manifest importance of cultivating the most friendly relations with all the independent States upon this continent has induced me to recommend appropriations necessary for the maintenance of these missions.
I recommend to Congress that an appropriation be made to be paid to the Spanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the Amistad case. I entertain the conviction that this is due to Spain under the treaty of the 20th of October, 1795, and, moreover, that from the earnest manner in which the claim continues to be urged so long as it shall remain unsettled it will be a source of irritation and discord between the two countries, which may prove highly prejudicial to the interests of the United States. Good policy, no less than a faithful compliance with our treaty obligations, requires that the inconsiderable appropriation demanded should be made.
A detailed statement of the condition of the finances will be presented in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The imports for the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1847, were of the value of $146,545,638, of which the amount exported was $8,011,158, leaving $138,534,480 in the country for domestic use. The value of the exports for the same period was $158,648,622, of which $150,637,464 consisted of domestic productions and $8,011,158 of foreign articles.
It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1848, including the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last, will amount to $42,886,545.80, of which $31,000,000, it is estimated, will be derived from customs, $3,500,000 from the sale of the public lands, $400,000 from incidental sources, eluding sales made by the Solicitor of the Treasury, and $6,285,294.55 from loans already authorized by law, which, together with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last, make the sum estimated.
Of the loan of twenty-three millions authorized by the act of the 28th of January, 1847, the sum of five millions was paid out to the public creditors or exchanged at par for specie; the remaining eighteen millions was offered for specie to the highest bidder not below par, by an advertisement issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and published from the 9th of February until the 10th of April, 1847, when it was awarded to the several highest bidders at premiums varying from one-eighth of per cent to 2 per cent above par. The premium has been paid into the Treasury and the sums awarded deposited in specie in the Treasury as fast as it was required by the wants of the Government.
The act of the 30th of July, 1846, ""reducing the duties on imports,"" has been in force since the 1st of December last, and I am gratified to state that all the beneficial effects which were anticipated from its operation have been fully realized. The public revenue derived from customs during the year ending on the 1st of December, 1847, exceeds by more than $8,000,000 the amount received in the preceding year under the operation of the act of 1842, which was superseded and repealed by it. Its effects are visible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity which prevails in every branch of business.
While the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duties of the act of 1842 and the substitution in their place of reasonable revenue rates levied on articles imported according to their actual value has increased the revenue and augmented our foreign trade, all the great interests of the country have been advanced and promoted.
The great and important interests of agriculture, which had been not only too much neglected, but actually taxed under the protective policy for the benefit of other interests, have been relieved of the burdens which that policy imposed on them; and our farmers and planters, under a more just and liberal commercial policy, are finding new and profitable markets abroad for their augmented products. Our commerce is rapidly increasing, and is extending more widely the circle of international exchanges. Great as has been the increase of our imports during the past year, our exports of domestic products sold in foreign markets have been still greater.
Our navigating interest is eminently prosperous. The number of vessels built in the United States has been greater than during any preceding period of equal length. Large profits have been derived by those who have constructed as well as by those who have navigated them. Should the ratio of increase in the number of our merchant vessels be progressive, and be as great for the future as during the past year, the time is not distant when our tonnage and commercial marine will be larger than that of any other nation in the world.
Whilst the interests of agriculture, of commerce, and of navigation have been enlarged and invigorated, it is highly gratifying to observe that our manufactures are also in a prosperous condition. None of the ruinous effects upon this interest which were apprehended by some as the result of the operation of the revenue system established by the act of 1846 have been experienced. On the contrary, the number of manufactories and the amount of capital invested in them is steadily and rapidly increasing, affording gratifying proofs that American enterprise and skill employed in this branch of domestic industry, with no other advantages than those fairly and incidentally accruing from a just System of revenue duties, are abundantly able to meet successfully all competition from abroad and still derive fair and remunerating profits. While capital invested in manufactures is yielding adequate and fair profits under the new system, the wages of labor, whether employed in manufactures, agriculture, commerce, or navigation, have been augmented. The toiling millions whose daily labor furnishes the supply of food and raiment and all the necessaries and comforts of life are receiving higher wages and more steady and permanent employment than in any other country or at any previous period of our own history.
So successful have been all branches of our industry that a foreign war, which generally diminishes the resources of a nation, has in no essential degree retarded our onward progress or checked our general prosperity.
With such gratifying evidences of prosperity and of the successful operation of the revenue act of 1846, every consideration of public policy recommends that it shall remain unchanged. It is hoped that the system of impost duties which it established may be regarded as the permanent policy of the country, and that the great interests affected by it may not again be subject to be injuriously disturbed, as they have heretofore been by frequent and sometimes sudden changes.
For the purpose of increasing the revenue, and without changing or modifying the rates imposed by the act of 1846 on the dutiable articles embraced by its provisions, I again recommend to your favorable consideration the expediency of levying a revenue duty on tea and coffee. The policy which exempted these articles from duty during peace, and when the revenue to be derived from them was not needed, ceases to exist when the country is engaged in war and requires the use of all of its available resources. It is a tax which would be so generally diffused among the people that it would be felt oppressively by none and be complained of by none. It is believed that there are not in the list of imported articles any which are more properly the subject of war duties than tea and coffee.
It is estimated that $3,000,000 would be derived annually by a moderate duty imposed on these articles.
Should Congress avail itself of this additional source of revenue, not only would the amount of the public loan rendered necessary by the war with Mexico be diminished to that extent, but the public credit and the public confidence in the ability and determination of the Government to meet all its engagements promptly would be more firmly established, and the reduced amount of the loan which it may be necessary to negotiate could probably be obtained at cheaper rates.
Congress is therefore called upon to determine whether it is wiser to impose the war duties recommended or by omitting to do so increase the public debt annually $3,000,000 so long as loans shall be required to prosecute the war, and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the semiannual interest upon it, and ultimately to extinguish the principal. If in addition to these duties Congress should graduate and reduce the price of such of the public lands as experience has proved will not command the price placed upon them by the Government, an additional annual income to the Treasury of between half a million and a million of dollars, it is estimated, would be derived from this source. Should both measures receive the sanction of Congress, the annual amount of public debt necessary to be contracted during the continuance of the war would be reduced near $4,000,000. The duties recommended to be levied on tea and coffee it is proposed shall be limited in their duration to the end of the war, and until the public debt rendered necessary to be contracted by it shall be discharged. The amount of the public debt to be contracted should be limited to the lowest practicable sum, and should be extinguished as early after the conclusion of the war as the means of the Treasury will permit.
With this view, it is recommended that as soon as the war shall be over all the surplus in the Treasury not needed for other indispensable objects shall constitute a sinking fund and be applied to the purchase of the funded debt, and that authority be conferred by laws for that purpose. The act of the 6th of August, 1846, ""to establish a warehousing system,"" has been in operation more than a year, and has proved to be an important auxiliary to the tariff act of 1846 in augmenting the revenue and extending the commerce of the country. Whilst it has tended to enlarge commerce, it has been beneficial to our manufactures by diminishing forced sales at auction of foreign goods at low prices to raise the duties to be advanced on them, and by checking fluctuations in the market. The system, although sanctioned by the experience of other countries, was entirely new in the United States, and is susceptible of improvement in some of its provisions. The Secretary of the Treasury, upon whom was devolved large discretionary powers in carrying this measure into effect, has collected and is now collating the practical results of the system in other countries where it has long been established, and will report at an early period of your session such further regulations suggested by the investigation as may render it still more effective and beneficial.
By the act to ""provide for the better organization of the Treasury and for the collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public revenue"" all banks were discontinued as fiscal agents of the Government, and the paper currency issued by them was no longer permitted to be received in payment of public dues. The constitutional treasury created by this act went into operation on the 1st of January last. Under the system established by it the public moneys have been collected, safely kept, and disbursed by the direct agency of officers of the Government in gold and silver, and transfers of large amounts have been made from points of collection to points of disbursement without loss to the Treasury or injury or inconvenience to the trade of the country.
While the fiscal operations of the Government have been conducted with regularity and ease under this system, it has had a salutary effect in checking and preventing an undue inflation of the paper currency issued by the banks which exist under State charters. Requiring, as it does, all dues to the Government to be paid in gold and silver, its effect is to restrain excessive issues of bank paper by the banks disproportioned to the specie in their vaults, for the reason that they are at all times liable to be called on by the holders of their notes for their redemption in order to obtain specie for the payment of duties and other public dues. The banks, therefore, must keep their business within prudent limits, and be always in a condition to meet such calls, or run the hazard of being compelled to suspend specie payments and be thereby discredited. The amount of specie imported into the United States during the last fiscal year was $24,121,289, of which there was retained in the country $22,276,170. Had the former financial system prevailed and the public moneys been placed on deposit in the banks, nearly the whole of this amount would have gone into their vaults, not to be thrown into circulation by them, but to be withheld from the hands of the people as a currency and made the basis of new and enormous issues of bank paper. A large proportion of the specie imported has been paid into the Treasury for public dues, and after having been to a great extent recoined at the Mint has been paid out to the public creditors and gone into circulation as a currency among the people. The amount of gold and silver coin now in circulation in the country is larger than at any former period.
The financial system established by the constitutional treasury has been thus far eminently successful in its operations, and I recommend an adherence to all its essential provisions, and especially to that vital provision which wholly separates the Government from all connection with banks and excludes bank paper from all revenue receipts.
In some of its details, not involving its general principles, the system is defective and will require modification. These defects and such amendments as are deemed important were set forth in the last annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury. These amendments are again recommended to the early and favorable consideration of Congress.
During the past year the coinage at the Mint and its branches has exceeded $20,000,000. This has consisted chiefly in converting the coins of foreign countries into American coin.
The largest amount of foreign coin imported has been received at New York, and if a branch mint were established at that city all the foreign coin received at that port could at once be converted into our own coin without the expense, risk, and delay of transporting it to the Mint for that purpose, and the amount recoined would be much larger.
Experience has proved that foreign coin, and especially foreign gold coin, will not circulate extensively as a currency among the people. The important measure of extending our specie circulation, both of gold and silver, and of diffusing it among the people can only be effected by converting such foreign coin into American coin. I repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message for the establishment of a branch of the Mint of the United States at the city of New York.
All the public lands which had been surveyed and were ready for market have been proclaimed for sale during the past year. The quantity offered and to be offered for sale under proclamations issued since the 1st of January last amounts to 9,138,531 acres. The prosperity of the Western States and Territories in which these lands lie will be advanced by their speedy sale. By withholding them from market their growth and increase of population would be retarded, while thousands of our enterprising and meritorious frontier population would be deprived of the opportunity of securing freeholds for themselves and their families. But in addition to the general considerations which rendered the early sale of these lands proper, it was a leading object at this time to derive as large a sum as possible from this source, and thus diminish by that amount the public loan rendered necessary by the existence of a foreign war.
In my last annual message I presented the reasons which in my judgment rendered it proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the public lands as have remained unsold for long periods after they had been offered for sale at public auction.
Many millions of acres of public lands lying within the limits of several of the Western States have been offered in the market and been subject to sale at private entry for more than twenty years and large quantities for more than thirty years at the lowest price prescribed by the existing laws, and it has been found that they will not command that price. They must remain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period unless the price demanded for them by the Government shall be reduced. No satisfactory reason is perceived why they should be longer held at rates above their real value. At the present period an additional reason exists for adopting the measure recommended. When the country is engaged in a foreign war, and we must necessarily resort to loans, it would seem to be the dictate of wisdom that we should avail ourselves of all our resources and thus limit the amount of the public indebtedness to the lowest possible sum.
I recommend that the existing laws on the subject of preemption rights be amended and modified so as to operate prospectively and to embrace all who may settle upon the public lands and make improvements upon them, before they are surveyed as well as afterwards, in all cases where such settlements may be made after the Indian title shall have been extinguished.
If the right of preemption be thus extended, it will embrace a large and meritorious class of our citizens. It will increase the number of small freeholders upon our borders, who will be enabled thereby to educate their children and otherwise improve their condition, while they will be found at all times, as they have ever proved themselves to be in the hour of danger to their country, among our hardiest and best volunteer soldiers, ever ready to attend to their services in cases of emergencies and among the last to leave the field as long as an enemy remains to be encountered. Such a policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer emigrants with deeper feelings of gratitude for the parental care of their Government, when they find their dearest interests secured to them by the permanent laws of the land and that they are no longer in danger of losing their homes and hard-earned improvements by being brought into competition with a more wealthy class of purchasers at the land sales. The attention of Congress was invited at their last and the preceding session to the importance of establishing a Territorial government over our possessions in Oregon, and it is to be regretted that there was no legislation on the subject. Our citizens who inhabit that distant region of country are still left without the protection of our laws, or any regularly organized government. Before the question of limits and boundaries of the Territory of Oregon was definitely settled, from the necessity of their condition the inhabitants had established a temporary government of their own. Besides the want of legal authority for continuing such a government, it is wholly inadequate to protect them in their rights of person and property, or to secure to them the enjoyment of the privileges of other citizens, to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United States. They should have the right of suffrage, be represented in a Territorial legislature and by a Delegate in Congress, and possess all the rights and privileges which citizens of other portions of the territories of the United States have heretofore enjoyed or may now enjoy.
Our judicial system, revenue laws, laws regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and the protection of our laws generally should be extended over them.
In addition to the inhabitants in that Territory who had previously emigrated to it, large numbers of our citizens have followed them during the present year, and it is not doubted that during the next and subsequent years their numbers will be greatly increased.
Congress at its last session established post routes leading to Oregon, and between different points within that Territory, and authorized the establishment of post-offices at ""Astoria and such other places on the coasts of the Pacific within the territory of the United States as the public interests may require."" Post-offices have accordingly been established, deputy postmasters appointed, and provision made for the transportation of the mails.
The preservation of peace with the Indian tribes residing west of the Rocky Mountains will render it proper that authority should be given by law for the appointment of an adequate number of Indian agents to reside among them.
I recommend that a surveyor-general's office be established in that Territory, and that the public lands be surveyed and brought into market at an early period.
I recommend also that grants, upon liberal terms, of limited quantities of the public lands be made to all citizens of the United States who have emigrated, or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate, to Oregon and settle upon them. These hardy and adventurous citizens, who have encountered the dangers and privations of a long and toilsome journey, and have at length found an abiding place for themselves and their families upon the utmost verge of our western limits, should be secured in the homes which they have improved by their labor. I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War for a detailed account of the operations of the various branches of the public service connected with the Department under his charge. The duties devolving on this Department have been unusually onerous and responsible during the past year, and have been discharged with ability and success.
Pacific relations continue to exist with the various Indian tribes, and most of them manifest a strong friendship for the United States. Some depredations were committed during the past year upon our trains transporting supplies for the Army, on the road between the western border of Missouri and Santa Fe. These depredations, which are supposed to have been committed by bands from the region of New Mexico, have been arrested by the presence of a military force ordered out for that purpose. Some outrages have been perpetrated by a portion of the northwestern bands upon the weaker and comparatively defenseless neighboring tribes. Prompt measures were taken to prevent such occurrences in future.
Between 1,000 and 2,000 Indians, belonging to several tribes, have been removed during the year from the east of the Mississippi to the country allotted to them west of that river as their permanent home, and arrangements have been made for others to follow.
Since the treaty of 1846 with the Cherokees the feuds among them appear to have subsided, and they have become more united and contented than they have been for many years past. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the act of June 27, 1846, to settle claims arising under the treaty of 1835-36 with that tribe have executed their duties, and after a patient investigation and a full and fair examination of all the cases brought before them closed their labors in the month of July last. This is the fourth board of commissioners which has been organized under this treaty. Ample opportunity has been afforded to all those interested to bring forward their claims. No doubt is entertained that impartial justice has been done by the late board, and that all valid claims embraced by the treaty have been considered and allowed. This result and the final settlement to be made with this tribe under the treaty of 1846, which will be completed and laid before you during your session, will adjust all questions of controversy between them and the United States and produce a state of relations with them simple, well defined, and satisfactory. Under the discretionary authority conferred by the act of the 3d of March last the annuities due to the various tribes have been paid during the present year to the heads of families instead of to their chiefs or such persons as they might designate, as required by the law previously existing. This mode of payment has given general satisfaction to the great body of the Indians. Justice has been done to them, and they are grateful to the Government for it. A few chiefs and interested persons may object to this mode of payment, but it is believed to be the only mode of preventing fraud and imposition from being practiced upon the great body of common Indians, constituting a majority of all the tribes. It is gratifying to perceive that a number of the tribes have recently manifested an increased interest in the establishment of schools among them, and are making rapid advances in agriculture, some of them producing a sufficient quantity of food for their support and in some cases a surplus to dispose of to their neighbors. The comforts by which those who have received even a very limited education and have engaged in agriculture are surrounded tend gradually to draw off their less civilized brethren from the precarious means of subsistence by the chase to habits of labor and civilization.
The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a satisfactory and gratifying account of the condition and operations of the naval service during the past year. Our commerce has been pursued with increased activity and with safety and success in every quarter of the globe under the protection of our flag, which the Navy has caused to be respected in the most distant seas.
In the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific the officers and men of our squadrons have displayed distinguished gallantry and performed valuable services. In the early stages of the war with Mexico her ports on both coasts were blockaded, and more recently many of them have been captured and held by the Navy. When acting in cooperation with the land forces, the naval officers and men have performed gallant and distinguished services on land as well as on water, and deserve the high commendation of the country.
While other maritime powers are adding to their navies large numbers of war steamers, it was a wise policy on our part to make similar additions to our Navy. The four war steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March, 1847, are in course of construction.
In addition to the four war steamers authorized by this act, the Secretary of the Navy has, in pursuance of its provisions, entered into contracts for the construction of five steamers to be employed in the transportation of the United States mail ""from New York to New Orleans, touching at Charleston, Savannah, and Havana, and from Havana to Chagres;"" for three steamers to be employed in like manner from Panama to Oregon, ""so as to connect with the mail from Havana to Chagres across the Isthmus;"" and for five steamers to be employed in like manner from New York to Liverpool. These steamers will be the property of the contractors, but are to be built ""under the superintendence and direction of a naval constructor in the employ of the Navy Department, and to be so constructed as to render them convertible at the least possible expense into war steamers of the first class."" A prescribed number of naval officers, as well as a post-office agent, are to be on board of them, and authority is reserved to the Navy Department at all times to ""exercise control over said steamships"" and ""to have the right to take them for the exclusive use and service of the United States upon making proper compensation to the contractors therefor.""
Whilst these steamships will be employed in transporting the mails of the United States coastwise and to foreign countries upon an annual compensation to be paid to the owners, they will be always ready, upon an emergency requiring it, to be converted into war steamers; and the right reserved to take them for public use will add greatly to the efficiency and strength of this description of our naval force. To the steamers thus authorized under contracts made by the Secretary of the Navy should be added five other steamers authorized under contracts made in pursuance of laws by the Postmaster-General, making an addition, in the whole, of eighteen war steamers subject to be taken for public use. As further contracts for the transportation of the mail to foreign countries may be authorized by Congress, this number may be enlarged indefinitely.
The enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various distant parts of the globe is established, by means of American built sea steamers, would find an ample reward in the increase of our commerce and in making our country and its resources more favorably known abroad; but the national advantage is still greater--of having our naval officers made familiar with steam navigation and of having the privilege of taking the ships already equipped for immediate service at a moment's notice, and will be cheaply purchased by the compensation to be paid for the transportation of the mail in them over and above the postages received.
A just national pride, no less than our commercial interests, would Seem to favor the policy of augmenting the number of this description of vessels. They can be built in our country cheaper and in greater numbers than in any other in the world.
I refer you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General for a detailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operations of that Department during the past year. It is gratifying to find that within so short a period after the reduction in the rates of postage, and notwithstanding the great increase of mail service, the revenue received for the year will be sufficient to defray all the expenses, and that no further aid will be required from the Treasury for that purpose.
The first of the American mail steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March, 1845, was completed and entered upon the service on the 1st of June last, and is now on her third voyage to Bremen and other intermediate ports. The other vessels authorized under the provisions of that act are in course of construction, and will be put upon the line as soon as completed. Contracts have also been made for the transportation of the mail in a steamer from Charleston to Havana.
A reciprocal and satisfactory postal arrangement has been made by the Postmaster-General with the authorities of Bremen, and no difficulty is apprehended in making similar arrangements with all other powers with which we may have communications by mail steamers, except with Great Britain.
On the arrival of the first of the American steamers bound to Bremen at Southampton, in the month of June last, the British post-office directed the collection of discriminating postages on all letters and other mailable matter which she took out to Great Britain or which went into the British post-office on their way to France and other parts of Europe. The effect of the order of the British, post-office is to subject all letters and other matter transported by American steamers to double postage, one postage having been previously paid on them to the United States, while letters transported in British steamers are subject to pay but a single postage. This measure was adopted with the avowed object of protecting the British line of mail steamers now running between Boston and Liverpool, and if permitted to Continue must speedily put an end to the transportation of all letters and other matter by American steamers and give to British steamers a monopoly of the business. A just and fair reciprocity is all that we desire, and on this we must insist. By our laws no such discrimination is made against British steamers bringing letters into our ports, but all letters arriving in the United States are subject to the same rate of postage, whether brought in British or American vessels. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General for a full statement of the facts of the case and of the steps taken by him to correct this inequality. He has exerted all the power conferred upon him by the existing laws.
The minister of the United States at London has brought the subject to the attention of the British Government, and is now engaged in negotiations for the purpose of adjusting reciprocal postal arrangements which shall be equally just to both countries. Should he fail in concluding such arrangements, and should Great Britain insist on enforcing the unequal and unjust measure she has adopted, it will become necessary to confer additional powers on the Postmaster-General in order to enable him to meet the emergency and to put our own steamers on an equal footing with British steamers engaged in transporting the mails between the two countries, and I recommend that such powers be conferred. In view of the existing state of our country, I trust it may not be inappropriate, in closing this communication, to call to mind the words of wisdom and admonition of the first and most illustrious of my predecessors in his Farewell Address to his countrymen.
That greatest and best of men, who served his country so long and loved it so much, foresaw with ""serious concern"" the danger to our Union of ""characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western--whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views,"" and warned his countrymen against it.
So deep and solemn was his conviction of the importance of the Union and of preserving harmony between its different parts, that he declared to his countrymen in that address:
It is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.
After the lapse of half a century these admonitions of Washington fall upon us with all the force of truth. It is difficult to estimate the ""immense value"" of our glorious Union of confederated States, to which we are so much indebted for our growth in population and wealth and for all that constitutes us a great and a happy nation. How unimportant are all our differences of opinion upon minor questions of public policy compared with its preservation, and how scrupulously should we avoid all agitating topics which may tend to distract and divide us into contending parties, separated by geographical lines, whereby it may be weakened or endangered.
Invoking the blessing of the Almighty Ruler of the Universe upon your deliberations, it will be my highest duty, no less than my sincere pleasure, to cooperate with you in all measures which may tend to promote the honor and enduring welfare of our common country.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Look at all the press that you attract. Do you believe this? That’s very impressive.
I hope not. You’re lucky. Thank you very much. Today, it’s my honor to welcome President NiinistO of Finland to the White House. And, Mr. President, it’s wonderful to host you once again in Washington. We’ve gotten to know each other over the last period of time, and it’s been -- it’s been a great experience.
The President and I have just concluded very productive discussions on a number of exciting opportunities for our two nations. Before going further, I want to express our deep condolences over the horrific stabbing attack that took place yesterday at a college in Finland. America is praying for the victims and their families, and we send our unwavering love and support.
The American and Finnish people are linked by an abiding commitment to self-government, individual rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This past May, our countries celebrated the 100th anniversary of America’s recognition of the independent nation of Finland in 1919.” A century after we established diplomatic relations, the United States and Finland remain united by those same cherished values.
Central to this effort is our nations’ close cooperation on matters of security and defense. Although Finland is not a member of NATO -- you save a lot of money -- Finland participates in many NATO missions and exercises. And I’m pleased that Finland is substantially increasing its military budget. America and Finland are also working together to advance stability, freedom of navigation, and respect for national sovereignty in the Arctic.
Both of our nations are committed to a secure Arctic region -- free from external intrusion, interference, and coercion. Simply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic. And, as you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic, and we don’t like it. And we can’t let it happen, and we won’t let it happen.
The United States and Finland are likewise partnering to ensure the security of 5G networks. It is critical that we use safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains. We welcome the establishment of the UROS Innovation Center in Finland. Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with that.
This Innovation Center will greatly expand American and Finnish businesses and cooperation in 5G. We're also glad that the Finnish company, Nokia -- it’s a great company -- a global leader in 5G technology, is developing its cutting-edge products right here in the United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey.
Across the United States, foreign direct investment from Finland totals over $10 billion. Each year, Finnish-owned companies invest more than $120 million in research and development in America, and expand our exports by more than $1 billion. Just today, Finnish Nokian Tyres opened a new manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee -- a $360 million investment that is creating hundreds of brand new, beautiful jobs for a great state: Tennessee.
We love Tennessee. So, they made a wise choice. You never lose when you go to Tennessee. I encourage other Finnish companies to increase their investments in the United States. There has simply never been a better time to do business in America. We have passed the largest tax cuts and reform, and also regulation cuts, in the history of country.
We slashed business tax. And we’re fueling job growth through our record-setting campaign to abolish all of those really terrible, unnecessary regulations. We have plenty of regulations, but many of them we didn’t need, and we got rid of them. The American economy is booming, wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and unemployment has hit its lowest level in more than half a century.
We want Finnish companies to join in America’s extraordinary economic revival. So many countries are coming in. It’s the hot place. We have the hottest economy in the world, and it’s the hot place to be. They all want to be here. The President and I are also working on a way to improve international trade based on the principle of fairness and -- my favorite word -- reciprocity.
I hope that Finland, which now holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, will support our efforts to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement with the European Union. We’re going to have to start doing something with the European Union because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years.
And they know it. And I tell them, and they know it. America’s trade deficit with the EU has been averaging $160 billion a year for many, many years. Achieving more balanced and robust trade flows would greatly benefit both Finland and the United States. We also appreciate Finland’s strong partnership in combatting predatory trade practices worldwide, including the theft of intellectual property.
From trade to security, from travel to commerce, we are immensely grateful for our close and deeply valued friendship with the people of Finland. Great people. And we’re now working on a deal to sell a large number of airplanes, fighter jets -- hopefully to Finland. We’ll see how that works out. But we make the greatest jets in the world.
We make the greatest missiles and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nobody is even close. Mr. President, I want to thank you again for visiting the White House. The history of our two nations is a profound testament to the importance of our independence and resolve to defend it. I look forward to continuing to work alongside of you as we safeguard our precious sovereignty and build a bright future of hope, harmony, and peace for the American and Finnish people.
And thank you very much for being with us at the White House and the Oval Office. We had a very special number of hours. Appreciate it very much. Thank you, sir.
Please.
Thank you. Before we take questions, something happened that's been -- it's been going on for many decades and we came to a conclusion. Could I ask Ambassador Pence to just come up for one second and explain the importance of what just took place? Because this has been going on for --
-- many, many years. And this is Ambassador Pence. No relationship to our great Vice President. Hard to believe. Nobody believes that, but that’s true.
Right?
Thank you. Fantastic job. Thank you. Be careful. Thank you. That’s a great job, Mr. Ambassador. That’s been going on for many, many decades. So, I just want to thank you. Outstanding. John Roberts?
Well, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what's been playing out, John, for the last -- since my election, I would say. If you wanted -- probably, we'll find out soon, but probably even before my election. This is a fraudulent crime on the American people.
. It was 100 percent. You have the transcript. And then, Schiff went up and he got -- as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn’t take place.
He made up the language. Hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown. But he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet -- which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this -- exact, word for word -- he said, ""Wow, he didn’t do anything wrong."" So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said.
It has to be a criminal act. It has to be. And he should resign. And some people even say it was treason. But it was a very sad thing. And just so you know, the call was perfect -- the real call; the call I made. Many people were on the line. I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders -- you can name any one of them -- but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies.
My knowledge -- I know all about it. And so this isn't something like, ""Oh, gee, I'm on the line. Let's talk about a big secret."" This is many people on the line. I don't even know how many. We'll find out, I guess. But many people. Mike Pompeo was on the line. He didn’t say anything. He just -- because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.
But the President of Ukraine, at the United Nations the other day -- and previous to that -- he announced through his spokesperson -- said there was absolutely no pressure put on him. There was no quid pro quo, at all. And if you look at this whistleblower's -- which I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they're real -- his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.
But what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call. Because I don’t like doing that. I don’t want to do it. I hope I don’t have to do it again -- release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders. I don’t want to do that, John. I don’t want to do it again. But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian government.
We got permission. We called up their representatives and asked them, ""Would it be okay?"" Otherwise, I couldn’t have done it. And if I wouldn’t have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report -- didn’t he say, seven or eight times, I said ""quid pro quo""? In other words, ""You're going to do this or you're not going to get money."" Now, in all fairness -- Biden said it, and he's on tape.
In all fairness, you have at least four United States senators -- Democrats -- that said it. And they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it. Obama, when he was dealing with the President of Russia -- not Putin -- he said, ""Hey, tell Vladimir I can do a lot more after the election."" You remember that?
You didn’t make a big deal out of that. Everybody thought, ""Oh, isn't that cute? Isn't that cute?"" My talk and my response -- Lindsey Graham said, ""I never knew you were that nice. I can't believe you were that nice."" He said that loud and clear. It was perfect. It was perfect. Not a thing wrong with it. To impeach a President over a fraud that was committed by other people that want to win an election in 2020 -- which they won't -- is incredible.
This is the greatest hoax. Now, it's gone on for a long time. We had the Mueller collusion delusion, okay? That went on for years. And that's finally done. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. It was a joke, and everyone knows it. And it was from the day one. Now I get three days of peace, and I'm walking into the United Nations, going to meet with the biggest leaders in the world, and I hear about the word ""impeachment."" I said, ""What did I do now?"" And it was about a beautiful conversation that I had.
And just remember this: The Ukrainian new President, a fine man, said, ""I don't know what you're talking about. There was no pressure."" And he said it a number of times. Okay, what's your second question? Well, you shouldn’t be asking two questions.
Do me a favor: Ask one of the Finnish --
John. John.
John, ask one of the Finnish President.
We'll talk later. Sure. Well, it sounds like it might be a good question. Let me see if I like the question. Go ahead.
Oh, I love that question.
It shows that Schiff is a fraud.
I love that question. Thank you, John.
Yes. There’s nothing to finish.
I hate to say it’s the New York Times. I can’t believe they wrote it.
Maybe they’re getting better.
Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before. I’d go a step further: I think he’s probably helped write it. Okay? That’s what the word is. And I think it’s -- I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out. It just happened. As I’m walking up here, they handed it to me. And I said to Mike -- I said, “Whoa, that’s something.
That’s big stuff.” That’s a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it, too. It’s a scam. It’s a scam. Just to finish on this -- I appreciate it. I love that second question, by the way. Should have asked it first.
The Mueller deal was a scam. The Russian collusion was a scam. You can ask Putin. Nobody has been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump, okay? Now, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia. And we will get along with Russia, because it’s smart. But nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
Okay. Ask one, please.
Yeah, please. Pick somebody who is really nice from Finland.
Do you have a really nice person?
I think they’re all nice in Finland.
Uh oh.
Or the other way around, you mean?
I think you mean the other way around.
So the political storm -- I’ve lived with it from the day I got elected. I’ve done more -- and this administration has done more than any administration in the history of this country in the first two and a half years. I’m used to it. For me, it’s like putting on a suit in the morning. People have said to me, “How does he handle it?” Rush Limbaugh said, “I don’t know of any man in America that could handle it.” Sean Hannity said the same thing.
Others have said the same thing, “I don’t know any man in America…” Because it’s all a fraud. And because of that, and because I know that I’m right, and because I’m doing a great job for the American people, I’m very, very happy living the way I’m living. I thought that I would finish off the first term without the threat of people making false claims, but this one turned out to be incredible.
All because they didn’t know that I had a transcript done by very, very talented people -- word for word, comma for comma. Done by people that do it for a living. We had an exact transcript. And when we produced that transcript, they died. Because you look at the whistleblower statement, and it's vicious.
Vicious. And that whistleblower, there's no question in my mind that some bad things have gone on, and I think we'll get to the bottom of it. I think it's going to be a total reversal. But I've lived with this. I've lived with this cloud now for almost three years -- more than that, because it probably started even before.
And I think nobody has done what I've done when you look at tax cuts and regulation cuts, and rebuilding our military, and Right to Try. Right to Try. That means people that are terminally ill and very sick have the right to use our medicines -- our great medicines -- because we're so far ahead of every other country.
So many things that we've done. Our vets are now taking care of. We've got Choice. Nobody thought we could ever get Choice. That's when you have to wait on line as a vet. You go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill. You don't have to wait for three weeks to see a doctor if you're a vet. We cherish our vets -- at least this administration does.
But for many years, they didn't. But I take care of the vets. No administration has done -- and I've lived with it from the day I got elected, so I'm just fine with it. Okay?
Jeff, go ahead.
No. No. I consider when they lie; when they stand before our great body in our great chamber, and they make up a story that's fiction, like Schiff did. He took that perfect conversation I had with the Ukrainian President, and he made it into a total lie. It was a total fabrication. And you do admit that.
It was a total fabrication. He said, ""This is what…"" -- and the only ones that don't like my conversation are the ones that never read it. But they heard Shifty Schiff. That's what I call a lie. And because of the fact that he's -- he's lying about the President of the United States and as to what the President says -- you know, I -- believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully.
There are those that think I'm a very stable genius. Okay? I watch my words very, very closely. And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another leader and make it sound so bad -- it was so evil. And now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible to have done unless there's corruption involved.
And just so you know, we've been investigating, on a personal basis -- through Rudy and others, lawyers -- corruption in the 2016 election. We've been investigating corruption, because I probably will -- I was going to definitely -- but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.
And I have every right to do that. Because the way they've treated me and other people -- they've destroyed people. They've destroyed their lives with a phony charge that never existed. And that was collusion. Never existed. And you had 18 people that hated Donald Trump. And you had Bob Mueller that hated Donald Trump.
And in the end, they couldn't find one damn thing. I could find it on you. They couldn't find one thing about Donald Trump having to do with collusion. This is after two years and spending $42 million. And I've been looking at that long and hard for a long period of time -- how it started, why it started.
It should never happen to another President ever. But I've been talking about it from the standpoint of bringing a major lawsuit, and I've been talking about it for a long time. We've been investigating the corruption, having to do with what they did to my people. They destroyed many of peop- -- many people.
They came down to Washington to do a great job, and they left home. They left Washington dark. They were dark. They came down here, I say, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. They wanted to do a great job for the people. They wanted to do a great job. We won the election. And then, they get served with subpoenas.
All these subpoenas. Now, look at Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like -- you know, she has to approve it. She hands out subpoenas like they're cookies. ""You want a subpoena? Here you go. Take them."" Like they're cookies. Paul Ryan would never give anybody a subpoena. He wouldn't give them when Mark Meadows went in to talk.
He wouldn't give them when Jim Jordan went in. When Devin Nunes -- he would go in, and they’d see Paul. I’m not saying wrong or right, but Paul Ryan: “No, let’s talk about it. That’s a big thing, to give a subpoena. Let’s talk about it.” Two weeks later, they’re still talking. They wanted subpoenas to investigate the corrupt Democrats and the corrupt people on the other side.
Paul Ryan would not give subpoenas. Nancy Pelosi? “Here you go. Take it. Who wants a subpoena?” Every day, you get subpoenas. And Paul Ryan was actually right, probably, because they should never, ever allow a thing like this to happen to our country again. Thank you very much. Please.
If you look at what he said -- okay? And he brought it up. I think he brought up the name, ""Rudy Giuliani."" What I want is the following: And I’ve said this loud and clear. We have our ambassadors here. We have Mike Pence here. Why are we the only ones that give the big money to the Ukraine? We give money to Ukraine, and it’s bothered me from day one.
And you have plenty of people -- just here. I say, “How come it’s always the United States that gets ripped?” Frankly, Ukraine -- we want to help them. And I do like the new President. You know why I like him? Because he was honest, because he said, “There was no pressure at all exerted on me” -- meaning him -- “by the President of the United States.” He said it. By the way, that one sentence should stop this.
But he said there was no pressure exerted. But you don’t have to ask him; all you have to do is read the transcript. Read the telephone call. But what I was having a problem with are two things. Number one, Ukraine is known -- before him -- for tremendous corruption. Tremendous. More than just about any country in the world.
In fact, they’re rated one of the most corrupt countries in the world. And I don’t like giving money to a country that’s that corrupt. Number two, I said --
Excuse me. Number two, I said the following -- and I said this loud and clear to everybody. And, in fact, Rob Portman backed me up, and there’s nobody more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio. Because he called up: “Please, let the money go.” I said, “Rob, I hate being the country that’s always giving money when Ukraine helps Europe and the European countries far more than they help us.” They’re like a wall between Russia and Europe.
They’re like a wall. They’re a big, wide, beautiful wall. And he said, “You know what? But it’s important.” And he -- in fact, he came out and he said that. That was my only reason. Because I don’t like being the sucker country. We were the sucker country for years and years. We’re not the sucker country anymore.
But I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked. But I don’t like to be the sucker. And European countries are helped far more than we are, and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine. Go ahead. Ask a question, please.
Look, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked. And you know it. His son walks out with millions of dollars. The kid knows nothing. You know it, and so do we. Go ahead. Ask a question now.
Are you talking to me?
. Listen. Listen. Are you ready? We have the President of Finland. Ask him a question.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
Ask him a question.
I’ve given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don’t be rude.
I’ve answered everything. It’s a whole hoax. And you know who’s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say, in many cases, the “corrupt media” -- because you’re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it’s corrupt.
And you have some very fine people, too -- great journalists, great reporters. But, to a large extent, it’s corrupt and it’s fake. Ask the President of Finland a question, please.
That was a big win for the United States, right?
You never had wins with other Presidents, did you? But we’re having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became President.
Yeah. Okay.
Excuse me. Your wins are now, because they think I don’t like the WTO, and they want to make sure I’m happy. Because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years. They know that I’m wise to it. We’ve had a lot of wins. This was a $7 billion win. Not bad. Go ahead.
And I just want to finish by saying it's an honor to be with the President of Finland. He's done a fantastic job. Very popular, beloved over in Finland. The WTO has been much better to us since I've been President because they understand they can't get away with what they've been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States.
And please remember the President's last remarks: that we are a great democracy. We are a great -- the United States is a great democracy. And I'm airing what I'm airing because we are, in fact, a democracy. And if the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation.
We would be a far greater when we don't have the CNNs of the world, who are corrupt people. Thank you very much, everybody.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, I'm deeply honored to welcome the members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the White House. I think we're going to have a lot of meetings over the years and I very much appreciate you being here. Throughout my campaign, I pledged to focus on improving conditions for African-American citizens. This means more to me than anybody would understand or know.
Every American child has a right to grow up in a safe community, to attend great schools, to graduate with access to high-paying jobs. America has spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas. I guess I heard just recently in the Middle East, we've spent as of about two months ago, $6 trillion. 6 trillion and you know where we are over there. While neglecting the fate of American children in cities like Baltimore and Chicago and Detroit, African-American citizens have given so much to this country.
They fought in every war since the revolution and they fought hard. They've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the march towards civil rights, enriched the soul of America in their faith and courage, and they've advanced our country in the fields of science, arts, and medicine. Elijah Cummings who was here about two weeks ago, who I happen to think is a terrific man.
I don't know if he'll say that about me, but I will tell you I really liked him a lot. And we were talking about drugs and prescription drugs and the costs. And you go Europe, you go to Canada, you go to other countries and you buy them for a fraction of what you pay in this country. And that's been a very big subject for him and it's a subject for me that is very important and we're going to either do it in healthcare, which I think we're going to do it in healthcare, or we're going to do it separately.
. And that's not only the drugs, it's prescription drugs, but - to stores and you go even in any community, rich or poor community, and you look at the kind of drug prices we're paying and it's really unfair what's happened in our country.
So we're going to be instituting a very, very strong bidding process. We'll probably need some legislation but we're going to do it regardless. We have to do it and we're going to get drug prices way down, way down. Some people think it's as important as the healthcare measure because people are being ripped off when they need they're - they need drugs.
They need prescription drugs and we're going to take care of that situation. So again, I very much appreciate you being here, it's a tremendous honor for me and we're going to work on different things and we're going to see if we can get a lot accomplished. And with that, let's get going and thank you all very much. Appreciate it.
"
Donald Trump,"So incredible. We have had, no matter where we go. You know, it's a movement folks. This is a movement. This is a movement.
No matter where we go -- it's amazing. We go to Dallas, we go to Oklahoma, we go all over. We went to the other night Iowa, packed every place, New Hampshire packed, every place we go to, it's like this. It's amazing and just great, great people. And they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, go home, we'll come back, we'll do another one but they had to go home.
Would you like to leave and we'll let them come in? No?
I don't think so. But we -- they turned away a lot of people and which is too bad actually. So maybe next time, I don't know, I think this is the largest room. I know it's a record for the room.
You know it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people in this standing and that setting. So that's great. I love. We love setting records. We want the country to set records right. So you know it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people and they're standing.
They're not sitting, so taht's great. We love setting records. We want the country to set records, right?
So I do this and I love to do it and I talk about our success because that's ultimately what it's all about. I think we're going to do fantastically well in Iowa. I really think we're going to do great there. And I could say, oh gee, if we came into top four or five, I'm not. I'm looking to win everything.
We want to run the table. We want to run it because that sends a signal. And you know, we've been a little bit -- we had to respond to Hillary. She came out with that...
No. She came out -- remember, she wrote -- she said he's got a -- he's demonstrated a pension -- I demonstrated a pension for sexism. Can you believe it? Me. Nobody respects women more than Donald Trump. And you know when she said that, I had no choice because I didn't start it. I had no choice.
And I did have to mention her husband situation, OK? And that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10. So we have to do it. You can't let people push you around. You can't let people tell lies. You can't do it.
You know, it's interesting. One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if it's Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. I can see that. I can see that. I can see it. And they said all of these people that are going to come in new that never vote, they never vote, they don't care.
They're going to mostly -- I tell you what, they're going to vote for Trump. That's why they're coming in because they're so fed up with this system. This corrupt horrible system. They're fed up with it and they're fed up with those guys back there, the media. They are the worst. They are the worst. They're fed up.
They're fed up with the media. I mean I've got and you know, not all bad but there's so much dishonesty in the media. And I like to call it out. And one of the things that's really been amazing to me and such it's been so beautiful to watch, the level of genius in the public. They get it. You know they really get it. They want to marginalize us. They want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, oh gee.
The level of genius they fully understand. They know they're crooked. They know they're dishonest and they really -- otherwise, who gets worst publicity than me?
And yet I see a poll at 42%. And you know you're talking about 15, 16 people started with 17. How were you? Started with 17 people. And you know, I'd be happy with 42, if we had three, OK? Not thrilled. I'd like to be that over that 50 mark, but I think we're doing really well. And you know it's interesting -- but the debates.
OK, so the debates. Thank you. I love you too, darling. I love you. I do. I love you. I love everybody. You know what, the rooms, no matter where, whether it's stadiums or big ballrooms like this one, it's amazing. And there's love in the room and I told the other night, I said, a friend of mine, very, very successful guy, who I would love to have negotiating against China.
That's what we need, not these hacks that we have. No, no. I have guys.
Carl Icahn endorsed me. A great businessman. We have -- I have great great business people that want to be involved and we're going to use -- we have the best, we have the best and we don't use them. We use political hacks, we use special interests people that really don't care about the country. They care about their deals.
This is going to change so fast. You know, last year, $500 billion-trade deficit with China. Thank you. You know what $500 billion is? You do $100 bills, you'd fill the room to the ceiling. $500 billion deficit, trade deficit with China.
What are we? Are we -- yeah, I guess, the answer is certainly, let's not blame us. Our leaders are stupid and/or, you have to say and/or, they have deals. Because what's happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists and these lobbyists make our leaders do -- our leaders, can you believe our leaders?
This is worse. But they make the leaders of our country do things that they don't even want to do because they've given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.
When I look at this guy, Jeb Bush, he spent $59 million on his campaign and he's down in the grave. He's nowhere. No, no, think of it. It's got to be much more than that. It was actually $59 million a while ago. Every time I turn on an ad, I see an ad about Trump. I mean, it's not that bad an ad either. It's like, you know, you're going to do an ad, do an ad. But look, he's a low-energy person.
Let's face it. We don't need low energy. We need lots of energy. But he spent, think of it, think of it, he spent $59 million. I spent nothing, right? Nothing.
Now I'm going to be spending. You probably saw, I'm going to spend now. We're going to start spending a lot of money because I don't want to take any chances. You know, I love getting up and for the last couple of months, I've been leading from practically the time I announce, right? And for the last -- I'm leading a lot.
I'm going to go over that because I go over polls. I love polls. I love polls. Now when they -- if they turn negative, I don't like them.
And I promise if they turn negative, I'm not going to be talking about it. In fact, I get criticized all the time. You're always talking about your polls. One of these guys has got two. He's a two. I'm at 42. And one of these guys who's at two said, he always talks about his polls. And I don't and I wouldn't do either if I had to, I swear I wouldn't. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it at all.
But you know, I love to tell the story where I've spent nothing and Bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that. That's just you know -- because I see since then I mean just you can't turn on this television without these commercials at Fox, every two minutes, it's a commercial on Trump. You know, what he did, it's false advertising.
So I killed him in the debate. According to Reuters, according to everybody, Drudge, who's an amazing guy, by the way, if you don't know Drudge, Matt Drudge.
Great. He's a great guy. But Drudge, 46%. 46%, you have 15 people. Now have you noticed, a couple have dropped out, a couple more. But 15, 16 people, 46%. Time magazine, 49%. Think of it. Slate, 51%. U.S. News and World Report, 69% said I won the debate. I won that debate, right? PBS, Public Broadcasting System, 69% said Trump won.
No, you know, it's amazing. We have Washington Times at 62%; CBS, 59%; Fox, 62%; Fox Las Vegas, 62%. So they all say. Then I go back home after the debate, I like to see how did I do. Did I look good? Looking good is very important, right? Sometimes it's not as much like what you say, it's how did you look.
I look good. It didn't sound too good but that's OK. You wonder is that a good trait.
But I go home I watch and the pundits will say, I mean, they can't totally kill me because I know what's happening. We know what's that. Well, Mr. Trump was OK tonight. He was -- I won every, every single online poll I won. And then here's Bush. So Bush does an ad and he takes me and he was talking about you know something, and he made a statement and and then I killed him.
I mean he -- by the way, I'm at 69%. He's at 1% he got. He came in last. He takes the ad -- and I shouldn't even talk about it. He's down to two or three, but I -- it bothers me when I see a guy spending $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right?
I say, why is he doing this. Does he have something better? He should go home. Just relax. No honestly, he should go home and relax. He shouldn't be wasting his time, but it does. I say, why is this guy spending all this money, now he's spending it actually against a couple of other guys. Theye were also very weak.
But here's my ad. So he made a statement and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great. He took on Trump. He took on Trump. I'm standing here. He's over here, took on Trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster. You know, sweet memory. He said, Mr. Trump, why don't you this, so OK, then I gave him an answer.
I said, Jeb, I'm at 42, you're at two, right? It's a simple answer.
You started off here right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there. By the next time, you're going to be off the stage, right? No, no. And then and that was it. So I responded. So he asked me a question. Question was fine. You know, professionally written. So he asked me a question. Good.
I give an answer. I blow him away, right? Everybody says, Trump won the debate. Everybody. And that's it. So the ad is him asking the question and I'm standing here like this because I haven't -- in fact, you see in one of my -- I'm just about ready to open my mouth, but he doesn't let me respond. That's almost false advertising, isn't it? You know.
So I mentioned that Hillary is a disaster.
I mean Hillary. Hillary's controlled by her money, so is Jeb, so is -- by the way, I'm the only one self funding my campaign. I'm self funding. You know, one of the things that makes me happy, I heard one of the commentators this morning said, you know, I'd been watching this stuff for 50 years. I've never seen anything like what's happened with Trump.
One of them actually said, one of them -- I'm special. You're special. I like you.
I'm special. Isn't that nice? That's a very -- every once in a while somebody can say something that hits you. Where are you? Who said that? Wow so nice. Thank you. That's a nice one, right? That's like, you know, every once in a while, there's a statement that's either nice or brutal. I think low energy was a brutal statement, right?
And by the way, low energy can be applied to Hillary. I just don't like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies, right, because I consider them enemies. We view this as war. Don't we view this as war? It's war. It's war.
And so you don't like to use it. I hate to give it up. What? We're going to help your daughter. We're going to help the country. That's called helping the daughter. We're going to help your country. So here's the story. So we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us. Our military is not prepared.
General Odierno when he left, just recently, he said, we are less prepared now than at any time that he can remember. And I think he went back to the beginning. But let's say second world war, OK? That's enough. Now we should be very prepared now because the world hates us. She has done a terrible job as secretary of state.
I mean, just think of it, Putin comes out, he said, Donald Trump is brilliant. He's doing an amazing job and he's leading the pack.
OK, that's nice. And she and my opponents always feel terrible that Putin said, wouldn't it be nice if we could get along with the world? Wouldn't it be seriously? No, no, wouldn't it be nice? I mean they want me to refute his statement. How dare you say I'm brilliant. How dare -- that's a -- who's going to do that?
And by the way, if he said it about any one of them, they would have been very happy. But the point is, we have to get along. The world has blown up around Barack Obama. Now I don't know if you saw his recent release. They were talking about the Department of State, State Department and they said very strongly, you know, the things that they've done.
Well they couldn't find it because what have they done that's good. And they said, bringing peace to Syria. Did you see that? So instead of saying they made a mistake, call it a typo. They made a mistake. They're trying to justify. Well, we meant we're working on it. Can you believe bringing peace to Syria.
The world is blowing up the migration is Syria.
They say, one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to Syria and the whole world is talking about it. It's the level of stupidity is incredible. I'm telling you. I used to use the word incompetent. Now I'll just call them stupid. I went to an Ivy League school. I'm very highly educated. I know words.
I had the best words. I have the -- but there's no better word than stupid, right? There is none. There is none. There's no word like that.
So we are going to turn things around but -- and if we have Hillary, I got to tell you, I just saw where for the last week she's been hitting me really hard with the women card, OK? Really hard. And I had to say, OK, that's enough, that's enough. And we did a strong number. She's not going to win. And by the way I love the concept.
I love love love having a woman president. It can't be her. She's horrible. She's horrible.
And you know who really don't -- I'll tell you who does not like -- yeah, we'll get Ivanka. Good. Let's do Ivanka. Let's go. But I'll tell you who does not like Hillary, our women. Women don't like Hillary. I see it all the time.
And always so theatrical. Mr. Trump said this and that and this. Oh and you just -- I actually -- I shouldn't do it. I just have to turn off the television so many times. She just gives me a headache. But you know, although I think last night, I gave her a big headache. I can imagine. I can imagine those discussions.
But you have to hit back hard and you can't let them push you around. And today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name. You know, in the debate, I was mentioned nine times. I mean, everything to all of them but her. I was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned.
And then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense and -- but she's playing that card and then I had to hit her back, so I hit her back and I talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse. No, it's tremendous abuse.
I mean you look at it, it's tremendous abuse. And I talked about that. And now today the television is going crazy and she gets up, makes a speech that does even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else. I wonder why? I wonder why? And remember this, it's really important.
A poll just came out where we're tied. Another one came out a couple of weeks ago, Fox where I'm leading by four or five points against her, individually. We're doing great. I haven't even focused on her yet. Look at the people I focused on, I don't want to really knock them. I don't want to mention their names, but you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me. Wouldn't it be nice if our country could have that same thing.
You attack and they are, boom, gone.And if we could do it verbally -- you know, if we could do it verbally, that's even better, right? You know, who wants to use our military?
By the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever ever ever. And we're going to take care of our vets. We're going to take care of our vets because they are being treated horribly. But we're going to build the strongest most powerful military ever and let me just tell you.
Let me just tell you a little secret. It's the cheapest thing we can do. We never gonna have to use it. I don't think we're gonna have to use it. Don't forget, they talked about my tone. I remember when Jeb and Hillary the same day, Mr Trump's tone is not nice. They're chopping off Christian's heads in Syria and other places and they want me to have a nice tone.
I'm supposed to be always isn't life wonderful, OK? Look, we've got to be tough. We've got to be smart. We've got to have heart too. We've got to have heart. We've got to take care of people. We've got to fix our health care program. This Obamacare is a disaster. You people know, you people know, Obamacare is a total catastrophe.
It's gonna be repealed and replace. It will die in '17 anyway. I don't know if you heard what's happening but it's so bad. All the people that they didn't think were signing up are signing up and the other people that are really paying for it, aren't signing up. And your rates are going up 25, 35, 45%. Your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, you're never gonna be able to use your deductible.
You're never going to be able to use it. So Obamacare is a disaster. We're going to repeal it. We're going to replace it. There are so many great things we can do on health care. So many great things.
And it'll cost you much less money and it'll be great. It will be great. I mean you're signing in to programs on things that you'll never ever use. You know that and you're paying for it and you'll never ever use them. So we'll get that straight now. We're going to straighten out a lot of things. We have to straighten out common core.
Common core is dead. It's gonna be dead. It's going to be dead.
When I look at parents and I see local parents in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, I went to a school and I saw the parents, they love their children. They want that. They want educate -- they love. They don't care about money, they don't care about anything. They love their children. And it's local and they get together and they do wonderful programs as smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats and getting big fat checks in Washington.
I mean, we have such talent in this country and we don't use it. So Obamacare, dead; Common Core, gone. We're going to get rid of it. Department of Education, we're going to get rid of it. We're bringing education to a local level.
One thing on education. So in the world, we are ranked number 28. There are third-world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things. And yet, per pupil, we are number one by far. There's nobody close. Number two isn't even close. So we spend more money per pupil than any country in the world and we're ranked number 28, which is way down.
Way down the bottom, essentially. I mean it's it's -- can you imagine we're ranked number 28 and we're number one. And that's what I do like saying about my campaign, I spent less money than anybody else and I have the best result. I'm number one by a lot. And I spent no money. I mean my plane cost me some money.
But I spent no ads. Took a little radio ad in Iowa, but I didn't do that. I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth.
But I spent essentially no money. And then you have all these other guys spending vast and they're like the way the United States is run. Now why would we put a guy, like Jeb, like some of the others. It's not only Jeb Bush. They spend money. I see Rubio at the ads all day long. You know the black background.
He's got like a black thing. Should have put something like that behind him, right? Right there, the flag. No no. And I like him. I think he's a nice guy.
But I see these ads you know with the with the backdrop and perfect. And it's just somber, it's not good. I think it's good. So think of it. I spent no money and I'm number one. Other spent. They will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they're not even in the race. That's what we need for our country.
What?
OK. I got 15,000, I know what that limit but that's OK. So but I think he's a fan. I don't think he's a pro. Are you a protester? No? OK. No he likes Trump. OK. He's not a protester. I love you. You know the only time -- don't worry about it.
The only time the cameras focused on the crowd is when we have a protest. Because I always have like look at this ballroom packed. I always have the biggest crowds and I go home and my wife said, were there many people? I watched you on television tonight. I said when I had 20,000 people. The whole -- she said, they didn't show it. They have -- right on your face.
So I have 20,000 people. I have 20,000 in Oklahoma, 35,000 in Mobile, Alabama. Nobody knows because those cameras they run in your face. And I think they can't move. You know, I think there may be fixed because modern cameras maybe. Except every time there's a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they're on drugs or something because some of these guys they said, they don't even know what the hell they're doing there.
All of a sudden the cameras swerve and they perfect shots.
And I like it because then it shows how big the crowds are. So you know. Sometime I think I'm going to put in some false protesters. I'll put in some friendly protesters. It's it's the only way I'm going to be able to get them.
So when we started, I talked about trade, I talked about the border. I talked about a lot of things and I started on June 16th and in Trump Tower or the famous escalator, right? And it takes guts to run for president. You know it's like I never did this before. And then they tell you're on a debate, we had the largest debate with the largest audience in the history of cable television.
Then CNN a couple of weeks later, had 23 million; Fox had 24 million; CNN had 23 million. The largest audience in the history of CNN.
Now they're there and the cameras on live right now. I mean, you know, it's largest audience in the history. And now the debates used to be -- if you go back four years or eight years, you know whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted. They didn't want the debates. I think they were forced to take them for licensing.
Nobody wanted the debates, so it drew nothing.
But now they're drawing 24 million. Now they want have more debates. Can we have more? Can we have more? Can they go three hours? Remember, when they had the one go three hours, I said, no, I'm not doing three hours. It's too long. Who wants -- I could stand up if here for 50 hours. But who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of this stuff, right?
Mr. Trump you have 30 seconds. What would you do about ISIS?
Oh great. And by the way, that question, I hate those questions, you know why? Because I want to be unpredictable. I don't want to tell ISIS what I'm going to do to knock the hell out of them. I hate it. I hate it.
Remember, I said very strongly, keep the oil for what, four years. You've been watching. I mean, four years, I've been get the oil, get the oil, get the oil because who is going to get the oil? Iran is taking over Iraq. We made a deal for Iran done by some of the dumbest people on earth on our side. We gave them everything they wanted.
We don't even get our prisoners back. And now Iran wants to start negotiating separately for them. Can you believe it. I go crazy. We would have gotten them back. All you have to do is say, we want our prisoners back. They would have said no.
I would have said, I want them back. You don't understand me. I want them back. They would have said, no, we won't do that. I would have said, bye bye and I would've left. Then I would have doubled up the sanctions. And I guarantee you, I guarantee you that within 24 hours they would have call back and they'll say, you've got your prisoners.
Can we talk? And I would have never given them $150 billion. I wouldn't never given them the money/ I would have never give. They used -- then I have to make nuclear. They can buy it. Why are they going to make it?
Then we have the nuclear where they have self inspection. How about the area, you know, they're big area. They don't want us there. Oh I wonder why they don't want us there. So they self inspect, OK? Then they have the 24-day inspection. But the self inspection is the beauty. We think you're making nuclear weapons here.
Well, let us go check Mr. President and we'll check. No sir, we're not making nuclear weapons. Nobody know. No we're not. We would never do a thing like that. These are people that have deceived us, they've lied to us. They're a terrorist state. But -- and I used to say it's the worst deal that I've ever seen negotiated and by the way, just to finish prisoners, so they come back, we get our prisoners.
But then when I hear the other day that now this deal is done. It's all done.
And now I hear they want to negotiate to get and what did they say. They said very strongly. They said, we are going to want a lot of, or the prisoners. That's our -- we're starting off. We're gonna want a lot. Now we've already taken off the sanctions. They're already rich as hell. What's going on there?
That's why I say, I mean, some people say, it's worse than stupidity.
There's something going on that we don't know about. I mean honestly. And you almost think -- I'm not saying that and I'm not a conspiracy person. She said, we are. We're saying it. I have the people in this room is saying and I'm trying to be like you know -- I'm just hoping they're just stupid people, OK, which they are.
Or there's something going on. Because it's inconceivable. You know, did you ever see where some things are so bad that it can't be -- that nobody can do what they did, right? Nobody.
So Iran now wants to negotiate separately for it. But that deal is done. Now we want to start all the deal and they want a lot. We want a lot and I just -- I want to just shoot the television, you know, because they would have had it, just for saying. And you know when they asked Kerry and Obama, the deal was made, everybody knows it's a horrible deal.
It's going to lead to -- it's going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation and they're so rich now. You know they became $150 billion, that's -- they became so rich and many other things that you don't even know about.
Most people don't even know what the agreement says. But I'll tell you what. When you look at what we're doing, we're not going to have -- if we keep going like this folks, we're not going to have a country left. We're not going to have a country. We're not going to have a country and we're like a dumping ground for the world.
We're a dumping ground. They want to take these -- the migrants you know and I feel terrible about the migration caused by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
They're the ones that caused it. They go into Libya. They knocked the hell out of Gadhafi. OK. So Gadhafi, they back rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people. You know that the ambassador was riding in a Jeep. One of our Jeeps, of course, a military jeep holding the Libyan flag and you know, freedom freedom freedom and then he gets killed by the same people.
So we backed people that turned out to be far worse than Gadhafi. Look what we did in Iraq. Look what we did in Iraq. I mean what the hell do we get? We spent $2 trillion and that was as a year and a half ago. I keep saying $2 trillion, it's a lot more than that. We spent $2 trillion. We have thousands of deaths and I'm not even talking other side.
You're talking about other side, you're talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions. You have thousands of deaths. We have wounded warriors who I love. All of -- these guys are the toughest. These are the greatest people. Now these are the greatest people.
And then what happens? We leave and we have a president that announces the date of when we're leaving. So I said, man, if I'm the enemy, I'm just going to go away for 18 months, right? He gave a date. We are leaving Iraq. We won't be gone by such and such a time. I said, I'm just sitting there watching and I'm saying, man, that's really stupid.
Because believe me, the enemy doesn't want to be killed. You know, you hear so much all they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right? They don't. They want to live. They want to live and they want to take care of their families, always their families remember that because their families know what's going on. OK? You think their wives don't know what they're planning.
You think their kids don't know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is gonna fly into the world trade center. You think they don't know? They know exactly what's going on. Remember that. And frankly, I think they have more love for their families live than they do for their own life, OK? But they still want to live.
So here's Obama gives an exact date, he gives an exact date. So they pull back and everyone says, oh, we're doing so well. Look, we're doing so well. The enemy. Why should they fight when they know in 18 months, they go on and take the place. So what happens? So we have ISIS taking a lot of oil. I said, take the oil.
Remember when we left, I was opposed to going in because I said you're going to destabilize the Middle East because you had Iraq and you had Iran. And I said, they'll fight. They are always fighting for decades and decades for generations. They fight. That's what they do. They fight. How we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe.
They fight. And they were equal, militarily. They go this way, 10 feet. They go this way, 10 feet then they rest. A couple of years, then they start fighting again. Then Saddam Hussein throws a little gas. Everyone goes crazy always using gas. They go back forth. It's the same.
And they were stabilized. And I said, if you go after one or the other, in this case, Iraq, you're going to destabilize the Middle East, that's what's going to happen. You're going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what happened. We totally destabilized the Middle East. We have now migrations largely because of what's happened afterwards.
You know Iraq was horrible.
It was stupid to go in. We should have never gone in. But we shouldn't have gone out the way we went out and we shouldn't be given dates. I mean, I would probably say we're gonna stay forever and they would've said, Oh man, and then keep going, keep going. Eventually, they would get tired. They say, this guy is crazy.
I mean, he's never going to leave and you'll make a deal. But when you announce you're leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pulled back and then as soon as we left, they come in. OK? so they have the oil. You know the biggest beneficiary of the oil is, right? China.
China always China. I love China. I love Mexico. Their leaders are too smart for us. We have no border. We will build a wall. Mexico will pay for the wall, by the way. They're building a wall. We're gonna have a border. And people are going to come into our country, but they're going to come in through a legal process.
They're not coming in the way they're coming in now just walking in like nothing. They're going to come in but they're going to come through a legal process.
So with Iraq, wo we give them a date and they take over. We didn't take the oil. So for four years I've been talking about it, then because of Paris, all of a sudden, they start bombing the oil. But I didn't want to just bomb the oil, I want to take the oil. They're bombing. You know, we're bombing, right?
What's going to happen after that? So we're bombing and you know, we're not really bombing it because they're still selling it. I say, how could they keep this up. Obama doesn't want to hit him too hard because he's afraid he's going to pollute the atmosphere. No, this is serious.
Now think of it. He talks about the carbon footprint and yet he'll fly a very old Air Force One, an old Boeing 747 with the old engines and you know spewing stuff. So he's got a problem with the carbon footprint. You can't use hairspray because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I'm trying to figure out.
Let's see, I'm in my room in New York City and I want to put a little spray so that I can, right?
But I hear, well, they don't want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump because the other one, which I really like better than going bing, bing, bing. And then it comes out in big globs, right? And it's stuck in your hair and you say, Oh my God, I gotta take a shower again. My hair is all screwed up, right?
I want to use hairspray. They say don't use hairspray. It's bad for the ozone. So I'm sitting at this concealed apartment. This concealed -- you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it's sealed.
It's beautiful. I don't think anything gets out. And I'm not supposed to be using hairspray. But think of it, so Obama's always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? No, no, think of it.
I mean even if you're a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem. Russia is a problem. China is a problem. We get a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons, right? That's a problem. We get a lot of problems. We got a lot of problems. That's right.
We don't win anymore. He said, we want to win. We don't win anymore. We're gonna win a lot. If I get elected, we're gonna win a lot. We're gonna win so much. We're going to win a lot. We're going to win so much you're all going to get sick and tired of winning years. You'll say, oh no, not again. I'm only kidding.
You never get tired of winning, right? Never.
But think of it. So Obama is talking about all of this with the global warming and that and a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean it's a moneymaking industry. OK? It's a hoax. A lot of it. Look, I want clean air and want clean water. That's my global -- I want clean clean crystal water and I want clean air and we can do that, but we don't have to destroy our businesses.
We don't have to destroy it, OK? And by the way, China isn't abiding by anything. They're buying all of our coal. We can't use coal anymore, essentially. They're buying our coal and they're using it.
Now when you talk about the planet, it's so big out there. We're here, they're there. It's like they're our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe. Miss Universe, by the way, made a great deal when I sold. Oh did I get rich. That was a great deal huh. You know they broke my choppers on that.
They said, he talks about illegal immigration. We're not going to put him on television. First of all, that Univision is being sued like crazy. You wouldn't believe it. And NBC made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal. Far more than I would have ever gotten. I mean, I made an unbelievable deal far more than I ever would have gotten if I said, I think I'm going to sell it if times were normal, right?
Isn't it amazing the way this is gonna work out. But I love Miss Universe and I love the universe. But think of it, so China is spewing up all this stuff and we're holding back. And with China, you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years. I don't think they're going to be doing it. It's like Japan.
If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War 3, OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. Somehow that doesn't sound so fair. Does that sound good? So South Korea, I order televisions, I order thousands of televisions a year. I ordered televisions because I have a lot of stuff.
I like nice branded. They're all made in South Korea. Most other than Sony and Sony in all fairness has lost its way. But a lot of Samsung, all of them. I mean they're all pretty much -- all of them, right? I think just about. But I order thousands of televisions, they're all from South Korea.
So we have 28,000 people on the border, separating South Korea from this maniac in North Korea. We get nothing. What, we get nothing. Nothing. They're making a fortune. It's an economic behemoth. A lot of you don't know, we protect Germany. Germany. Mercedes Benz. How many people have a Mercedes Benz? We protect Germany.
It's an economic behemoth. We protect Saudi Arabia. They were during the good old days. Now it's probably half, which is fine. But during the good, they were making a billion. Listen to this, a billion dollars a day. And we protect them, our military. They pay us peanuts like nothing.
And then if we want to buy, if we want to move to another location, well, that's more expensive if we do that. We want to -- they charge us rent. I mean, look, we are run by people that are so bad. They're so out of their league. And I see it. I see it on the stage. You know there are a lot of them are nice people.
You know a lot of people think I don't like this, but I do like them. But they don't have business sense, they don't have business ability. They don't have common sense. They're all politicians. They're all talk and no action.
When I say, folks, when I say, we're going to build a wall, most of them say, you can't build a wall. We'll build a wall. In China, 2,000 years ago, they built the Great Wall of China, which is bigger than any wall we're thinking about, OK? The Great Wall of China goes 18,000 miles. We have 2,000 miles, of which we really only need 1,000 miles because you have a lot of natural barriers, right?
That extremely tough to get across. We have a thousand miles. So China has 18,000 or 13,000 miles and we have 1,000 miles. We have modern cranes. We have Caterpillar tractors. I want to use Caterpillar. I don't want to use Komatsu. Made in America.
Even my hats, they're made in America. Wasn't easy to find the guy could do those hats. You know what I'm talking about. I see so many knockoffs of my hat, right? Make America great again. I see these things are out of plastic. They're out of all sorts of crap. Mine are made in America. And honestly, they do a great job but they don't produce as many as I'd like because frankly, there's a big -- I mean, it's amazing.
Those hats are amazing. But I wanted to have it made. And you know why I wanted, I wanted it anyway. But I also knew that as soon as the hats came out and other things, we have a website. As soon as the hats came out, I knew the press would be calling. And it's true. First hour when the hats were announced, I get a call from the New York Times.
Mr. Trump, where are those hats made? I said America. I knew it.
I know it. Because, as you know, if I would have said China, I would have been in big big trouble. But they're being knocked off all over the world. I mean, I see hats they're like helmets. I see them all. But what are you going to do?
But here's the story. We've got to build a wall. So when I talk and when I'm up on the stage with these guys, these people, wonderful people and a very nice woman, Carly. She's a nice woman. When I'm up on the stage with them, they think I'm crazy when I say Mexico. So I say, we're gonna build a wall. It's gonna be a great wall.
It's gonna be a great wall. See the ceiling, the ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall I'm talking about. I'm talking about if they ever get up there, they're not coming down because it's too dangerous.
All right. You ever see what they do now? We have these little walls, they build ramps. They build a ramp. I say, wouldn't it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just -- and then they drive over it with Jeeps loaded up with drugs. Do you see this? They build ramps so it was a picture in Time Magazine.
It's a ramp, a little ramp that goes over the wall and down. So they have a Jeep over, down, boom make money. We get the drugs. Think of it, we build a wall. It's right, you've got to build the wall. We get the drugs, they get the cash. Not so good, right? We don't like that deal. Our politicians don't know.
They don't know.
So when I say, Mexico is going to pay for it. These guys are on the stage with me. They're not business people. They don't understand. Mexico makes a fortune off the United States. Number one, we give them a lot of money. But in addition to that, they're taking our businesses. They're making -- if you talk about a trade deficit, I'll tell what Mexico in a certain way is in a mini version to new China.
Mexico is making an absolute fortune. Peanuts compared to the cost of the wall. Let's say the cost of the wall is $10 billion. That's a good. I can do a great job for 10. I think we'll have a lot of money left over.
Somebody else would have. You know, they -- and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall. People that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they want to build a wall. You know one of the reasons they didn't build the wall? Because of the Environmental Protection Agency. They couldn't get an environmental impact study approved.
Can you believe it? Because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way. Now think of it. In China, in the South China Sea, there were these low level landmasses that were covered by water but pretty close to the top. China sends in massive excavators and they're gonna blah. They're building military fortresses in the South China Sea.
And a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in China, he's a great guy. They're great people. They're fine. They're just too smart. I mean, the leaders are too smart for our people. They won't be too smart when I put my people there. When they call up, we'd like to speak to the donor that is negotiating.
No no. The donor now is Carl Icahn. You're going to speak to Carl Icahn. You know Carl great businessman. You have so many people. They call all these business people call. So a friend of mine so I call him and I say, you're actually doing that. And then jokingly, I said, how long did it take to get started?
Did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate? He looked at me cause I hope you're kidding when you say that. They conceived of the idea. They started digging 4 hours later, OK? There's no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you're going to hurt the snail, you're going to hurt this, you're going to -- they're doing a big thing.
They excavated massive mass of -- take a look, massive, the biggest excavator. They're ripping the hell out of that ocean. They're ripping it and they're taking that dirt and they're putting it and they're building airfields and they're building forts.
We couldn't do it because just like I said for the wall, legitimately, they couldn't get an environmental impact. Now that's probably not the only reason it didn't happen. I heard their costs were too high. With me, that's easy. You know I'm doing the old post office at wash. I'm under budget. I'm ahead of schedule.
Hey, look at look at the campaign, guys have $59 million and he's down at the bottom. I'm nothing and I'm at the top. It's the same thing. I actually said -- it's funny. The other day, I got this great review. They said, Trump is a great speaker. The crowd is spellbound but he has one problem and I'm reading.
I want to see the problem is he speaks through the applause. In other words, like I say that, you applaud, I start talking before you finish your applause and you know why?
Because I'm so excited because we have so much potential. It's true. I don't want to wait for you're freaking applause. We have -- I have so many -- We have we have so much potential. There's so many things to do. I don't really sort of want to wait. I want to do it and I just noticed. I did it again. You were getting ready to give a big applause because you like that and I'm speaking.
I kill the applause but he's right. He's right. But except I'm not a speaker. What I am is a doer. I get things done. I get things done.
So when the people up on the stage with me and Hillary, Hillary doesn't have a clue. By the way, you talk about low energy. She has lower energy than Jeb Bush, which is hard to believe. She does. And I'll tell you and I've been saying it and maybe it's rude maybe it's not, but it doesn't matter. We have a much bigger problem.
We have to save our country. So if I'm rude and if people think I'm weird, I'm actually a nice person. I have a big heart. I want to help people. I want to help the migration. I want to do a safe zone in Syria. I don't want him coming here. We don't know who these people are. They're undocumented. They're undocumented and we should do a safe zone over there.
We should have the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and these states that are not spending. They got to spend. They've got to pay. You know we're protecting them. We're doing -- they wouldn't be there for two minutes if we're not protecting them. They got to start paying. They're not taking anybody, OK?
How about Germany taking millions a year. Can you believe what she's doing to that country. And she was the person of the year and I wasn't. Everybody said Trump was supposed. Hey, what are you going to do. I think she's made -- I think I think she's made -- I think she's made a terrible mistake. We'll find out.
Time will tell. They having tremendous crime problems. I think she's made a terrible mistake. But what I like is in Syria, with other people's money, meaning the Gulf States and others and Germany and others because look Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people. They'll give us. We do a massive safe zone and then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I'll probably be able to get it straightened out.
I understand that stuff.
But once it's straightened out, they could go back home to their country, you know, to their area. It's interesting. I have thousands of people that work for me, thousands and I have people that come from far. They're all here legally, don't worry about it, I use E-Verify a lot. But I have people, I have people -- they go and check.
These guys go check. They went into the old post office checking everybody walked that door. Are you here legally? Are you here legally? They said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds. I don't believe it. OK? I don't believe it. But you know, it's possible somebody said, hey, we do have 11 million people in the country and it's probably a much higher number than that.
OK? It's probably a much higher number, but we have to do something about it and we're going to do.
So I just want to finish by saying this, look, we have a situation that's out of control. Our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We're laughed at by the rest of the world. And when I started this journey and it's a journey and I do love you people. You're amazing people. And by the way, you're so smart.
You know a lot of times they'll say, well Mr. Trump's people are blue collar. I love blue collar. I'm honored by that. But they're not blue collar. I mean, we have blue collar and we have executives and we have young people. They should -- the audience is older -- it's not older. The audience is young. The other night in Iowa, I told that and I said we have so many young people and the place erupted.
They're all young people. We have an amazing thing happen. It's just...
Look. That's their way of marginalizing not even me it's marginalizing you. It's disgusting. I mean, it's disgusting. But when I started this journey and that's what it is it's a journey and it's a movement that's taking place. It's a movement. Remember the old days, silent majority. It's not right. It's a noisy majority.
People are angry. It's a noisy majority. These aren't silent people anymore. I go to people you can't even hear.
This is an amazing thing that's happened. I received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal but that's OK. We can have a couple of them, right? But a guy who is really respected recently and he said, how does it feel? I said, how does what feel? He said, what you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States.
I mean even CNN said, number one political story of the year is Trump. You know who at number two was? ISIS. ISIS was two. I'd rather reverse it. Let ISIS be one, let me be two because I want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year.
Make me number one next year. But this reporter who is a great intellect actually and very smart guy, very good guy, he said, he said, what you've done has never been done before in the history of this country. Newt Gingrich was on a television show the other day said, this is one of the great phenomenons I've ever seen in politics.
Nobody's ever seen it cause crowds like this forget it. I mean, it's only confined in this venue. Again, they sent 3,000 people home.
Can you believe it? Three -- more than 3,000. It's it's unbelievable what's happening. It's beautiful what's happening. It's beautiful what's happening. But Newt Gingrich said, he's never seen anything like this. But he said to me, the reporter, he said never been done before. I said, well, you know, it's fine.
But if I don't win, it's just a waste of time. He goes, no no no. What you've done is incredible. He said even if you don't win, what you've done is incredible. You've totally changed the landscape of politics. No, but... Don't applaud. Don't applaud.
Don't applaud. He said, you've totally changed the landscape of politics. It's forever going to be different. Your campaign has never been anything like it, OK? He was overly nice. I said you don't understand. You don't understand. If I don't win, I will consider this and I mean this, a total and complete waste of time.
I really do. So because we're not going to do anything. It's wonderful. Good. I had nice crowds. They'll write about me every once in a while, every two years I'll have a story, Trump had this rather good campaign. If we don't win, to me, and honestly, you should feel the same thing. If we don't win, it's a total waste of time because you have somebody else in there.
They won't be able to do what I do. They're not going to be able to. And even if you get one of these Republicans in, like I didn't finish Mexico. The wall. When I say Mexico is going to pay, they all laugh. They all go, ha ha ha. They think it's funny.
Honestly, these are people they think it's funny. They're laughing. You know lightly like, oh oh oh, that's so funny, ha ha ha. They get to pay for the wall, folks. They're making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico. The wall is peanuts. They get to pay for the wall.
But I have mentioned it, now they don't laugh because they suddenly agree with me. And then the other day one of the people said, it was Ted Cruz, who's a nice guy, but he said, we're gonna build a wall at the southern border. I said. wow. And my wife was sitting. Where did that come from, right? No. Ted's a good guy but he said on -- I think it was on Fox News being interviewed and he said, we're going to build a wall at the southern border.
He didn't say Mexico is gonna pay. He hasn't gotten that far yet but believe me, that's going to happen. See they're all trying to catch up with me because when I did this stuff, it was very out there. Now, I'm the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to. But what happens is so Ted's up and he's talking, and you know routinely we're gonna have the border, we're gonna have this, that and we're gonna build a wall.
My wife is sitting and she's, darling, did you hear that? He just said they going to build a wall. That's the first time ever, you know, that's what you say. She hasn't heard that from any other candidate. OK, so we're going to build a wall. Mexico is gonna pay for it. There's so many things we're gonna do. But when I when I started the journey, it was amazing.
I came down took courage. I went down into the lobby of Trump Tower on the escalator with Melania. I have never seen -- it look like the Academy Awards, the press. We have a lot of press here today, all alive. Look at all those live cameras.
So when I came down, when I came down in the escalator, we came down and I said, we're going to do things. And I mentioned illegal immigration. You wouldn't even be talking about illegal. It wasn't even on the radio. Nobody was talking about illegal immigration. Is that right?
Now, it's one of the big subjects and that's why. And one of the beautiful polls that came out and I'm so proud of it. CNN just came out with a poll couple of I guess a week ago, 36% for Trump, second is 16%, third is 14% and then 12%. It's all the way down. But on the economy, they give me 55, 55%. That's with 16 people at the time.
On the budget. I mean, I understand the budget, the economy, I win it hands down. All right. But listen to this on illegal immigration, I'm almost at 50%. And on ISIS, likewise almost at 50%. So people want to be protected.
They want to feel safe. They need strength. They need toughness. They need smarts. I don't want to be tough. You know, I know a lot of tough guys but they're not smart. And they're the they're the easiest. You can be tough, but you've got to be smart. Let's start smart first. You got to be smart tough.
You got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us. So what happens is this, I came out, I started, I did it, I was, Oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration in Mexico and all of this stuff. Then Kate was killed in San Francisco and Jamiel was killed in Los Angeles. Jamiel show an unbelievable young man was killed just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant.
Kate was shot by a guy came in five or six times shot in the back. So many great people that -- these are two so many. And then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren't paying taxes and all of this stuff, right? And all of a sudden people are coming over and I'd say, the wall and now they're starting to say the wall.
We have to be progressive in our thinking. When I say progressive I mean like smart. I'm not talking progressive like a Bernie Sanders would say this guy wants to tax you think of it. Think of it. This guy wants to raise your taxes to 90%.
No no. Think you'll have to move out of this. I love this area, by the way, I've been here many times, great golfing area, right? We love it. No more golf and Bernie said no more golf. No no.
You won't have any golf anymore. They won't be -- you won't have any money left to be golf. You'll be paying it in taxes. This guy is a total disaster. And I'm not saying that. I tell you what. You know, Hillary said, well, I'd like to run against Trump.
Believe me, this poor Chuck Todd meet the press. His show is dying. And he keeps saying, do it, do it, but I never liked it. You know, I just -- he never treated me fairly. So I do a show, it gets the highest ratings he's had in years. He went from like a -- believe me, I won't even give you the numbers.
They were massive, the numbers, right? I saved his life. And then he goes, Hillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump. And yes and they're looking forward to it. Trust me. The last person -- She's already gotten a dose last night. Do you agree? She had a tough night. She had a tough night.
She had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant, OK? So Hillary Clinton said, and here's Chuck Todd and he's a nice guy, I'm not trying to knock him.
Please don't be insulted, Chuck. But she says she doesn't like him. But he doesn't treat me right. So he goes, the Clinton campaign said that they'd most like to run against Trump, like I'm some kind of a sap. So I come, I say, Chuck, let me explain something, when they say they want to run against me, that means they don't want to run against me. Do you understand that?
Do you understand it's reverse psychology? They say they want to run against me. First of all, I'm winning and tied in the polls now and I haven't even hit her yet. But look at what happened to all the guys I hit, they're gone so. They're gone or they're failing badly. OK? And they'll be gone soon.
But Hillary Clinton, think of it. So I say, so Chuck, report it like properly. Trust me. They don't want to run against Trump. The last thing she wants in her whole life is -- this was only -- I did this in like 15 minutes what happened to them. Because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things.
And the husband is one of the great abuses of the world. Give me a break. Give me a break. Give me a break.
So the last person she wants to run against is me. Now, here's the story. Look, here's the story. It's very simple. So I announced and I was talking about trade. I was talking about the wall. I was talking about the borders. I was talking about Obamacare. I was talking about Second Amendment will be saved, by the way.
Second Amendment. It will be saved. The Second Amendment is going to be with us.
If I'm president, you know, they're doing everything. They want to get rid of the bullets now. They're doing everything they can. Think of Paris, think of Los Angeles, think if you had some guns in Paris on the good side right? They had no guns. Paris is the toughest gun laws in the world, folks. And France, I mean, you get caught with a gun, it's -- The only one that has guns are the bad guys.
So they go in these various places, they call the guy the mastermind. He's a moron. I mean, this guy was a moron. I called him the guy with a dirty hat, right? They got him. So good. By the way, the French police did a great job and our Los Angeles police did a phenomenal job. They did a great job.
But wouldn't it be wonderful if let's see, this guy, right here in front of me, he's a tough guy. This guy with the hat with a lousy head of hair but he's a strong looking guy right here. This guy right there, see. And that -- wouldn't it be nice if they had a gun on their waist. Somebody? Him him him.
So that when they shot -- you know they were doing in Paris. Get over here, bum. Get over here, bum. Your turn. Get over here. Bum. 130 people with more to follow cause there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals. Other people are going to die. Same thing over there. These are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage.
There's something going on folks it's wrong. They gave them a party. They work there. They gave them a party.
She came in and a fiance permanent or some nonsense. And she was radicalized and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized and people knew that they were radicalized. And people in the area knew that they had bombs all over. Who the hell doesn't know, your the next door neighbor and they didn't want to talk about it. You've got to report these people.
We've got a real problem. You've got to report them. No more nonsense.
They didn't report them. And the reason they didn't is because they don't disagree with them so much. OK. Believe me. It's not because they're afraid. You saw the one it wasn't politically correct to report him. They didn't want to report him. I mean, give me a break. So we have to change. So it started off with me where I was going to talk about trade.
I was going to talk about all the things. I was going to talk about the military, building it up. I was going to do all of this. But after Paris and California and there'll be others because they have no fear of us. But after Paris and California have totally changed and my poll numbers were up 10 points.
It's amazing. It went up 10 points, I said, why? Do you think it was the debate? Because I did good in the debate. They should know people view you as a tough cookie that's not going to take this crap. That's what it is.
And now I talk about protection. I talk about -- trust me. The trade. Oh, that's so easy for me. I got the greatest guys in the world. They're going to come and they're gonna do a great job. I'm going to do some myself. I always talk about forward.
They're gonna build a plant, $2.5 billion in Mexico, not going to happen with me. That stuff. Those deals are no good. Ford's leaving. They're closing plants all over Michigan to build a plant and in Mexico. How the hell does that help us? OK. Who are the people that think this is a good thing for us. And in the meantime, in Michigan and other places where plants closing all over the place and they're spending think about it, $2.5 billion.
And then they get to sell cars, trucks and parts into the United States, no tax, no nothing. I'll say, you don't have to pay tax folks. And you know what, Ford will say, if I've got to pay tax were gonna to stay in the United States. I mean, it's very simple. It's very simple.
How about two weeks ago, Nabisco announced, the big Chicago. They announced are going to leave Chicago with one of their big plants and they're going to move it to Mexico. What's my statement? We're not eating Oreos anymore, right? No more. But I don't want this. It's not going to happen. They're gonna make product and they're going to sell it into the United States, not going to happen.
It's not going to happen. And by the way, I'm a free trader.
I believe, but you've got to be smart. I mean, we've got to get something. We don't get anything out of anything. We don't get anything. We lose on everything. That Iran deal was a disaster. By the way, I think of the Iran deal for one second. I always -- and this came to me two weeks ago, I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.
Very disappointed with myself. The Iran deal is the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated.
OK. I'm wrong. You know what the worst deal is? Iran is a part of that one too. We gave them Iraq. That's even better. Think of it. We gave Iran, Iraq. Iran has the biggest, think of it. They're going to have the richest -- If you go to Iraq, take a look, among the largest oil reserves in the world. We gave them by decapitating Iraq and then leaving because frankly, once we did it, we should have kept 20,000 troops to stay.
We give Iraq. So not only did they make a great deal in terms of the Iran deal that we know, having to do with nuclear. We also gave them Iraq. We gave them Iraq that they've been after for 100 hundred years. We hande it to them. So now they have the largest oil reserves among in the world. That's even better than the original deal.
I mean, whoever is representing Iran is doing a hell of a job. OK? That was a stock, you got to buy some.
So we are not going to have deals like that with me. It's not going to happen. We're going to become rich again, we're going to become safe again and we're going to become strong again. And you're going to remember this moment, this is going to be an important moment for all of us. The one thing I have to say and I have to ask you to do, go out and vote.
It's going to be your turn.
Number three. Remember, it starts on February 1st with Iowa.
We got four weeks to go and then we have three weeks after we start. No matter what's going on in your life, you got to go and vote. Because if you don't, it's not going to happen. Don't sit back and say, oh, Trump's going to do well. The more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense because it's like a mandate.
But you got to go out and vote. And I will tell you this, it's been an honor to be here. I love this area. I love the people here. It's been an honor.
But we will make America great again. I promise. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you.
"
Norman Lamb,"A reshuffle is a strange thing.
I’ve followed the health reforms pretty closely so I’m relatively up to speed.
But often, new ministers find themselves in departments where they know only the bare bones of the policy. And they’re expected to turn themselves into experts overnight.
I’ve been an MP long enough to hear my fair share of new ministers read out speeches in the Commons and clearly have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about. The crueller members of the opposition can sometimes make it a bit of a trial for them.
But the machinations of government can’t just creak to a halt as the new people find their way around. So new ministers rely on ever-present civil servants to guide them. They rely on ministers who haven’t been reshuffled to keep a hand on the tiller. And they rely on their fellow new ministers to be conscientious, decisive and creative about their own parts of the portfolio.
In other words, for reshuffles to work, every part of government needs to be supportive of all the other parts.
The same is true if we want to make people healthier and improve local services.
The difference, of course, is that poor integration in reshuffles mean ministers looking a bit stupid.
But in the wider world, it is a lot more important.
Disjointed care can and does impact on people’s lives in a big way. Whether it’s:
At the moment, those sort of situations are all too common.
To put a stop to them, all parts of the system have to work together.
That’s when things really get better. Not just with health and social care, but with other factors that affect health, like housing, work and education.
One of the reasons I was so eager to be a minister is so I can push that hard.
The consensus behind integrated care is pretty universal. In government, in think tanks, in patient groups everyone sees it as A Good Thing.
But that’s not enough. We need to transfer it from the academic papers and into the health &amp; wellbeing boards, hospitals and community centres.
It takes a lot of political oomph to do that.
I want to provide that oomph.
From my first day in my new office, I was asking to talk to the Department of Health’s experts on integration. Reading the latest research.
And the first thing on my agenda is to arrange a roundtable with the Kings Fund and a wide spread of other groups, to work out a way of translating consensus into results.
One thing we can be sure of is that there is funding to really get things going.
As announced in the Care and Support White Paper Caring for our future, over the two years from 2013/14, an extra £300 million will go from the NHS to local authorities to get health and social care services working better together. That’s on top of the £2.7 billion transfer to local authorities that was announced in the 2010 Spending Review.
And there will be an extra £200 million over the next five years spend on better housing options for older and disabled people.
On top of that, there is more money for priority services, like January’s one-off £150m to reduce delayed transfers of care.
That sort of money opens doors. But because of the financial situation that we all know about, that money – and people’s existing budgets – needs to produce results.
Everyone needs to do their bit to get the most from their money. Delivering better services and better outcomes, in ways relevant to individual areas.
That’s why I was so pleased to see that the Care and Support White Paper clearly sets out what we are going to do to further integrate services.
One of the big issues is that ‘integrated care’ itself is a problematic phrase. Understandably, when you’re talking about such a broad concept, there’s a lot of disagreement over what it means.
So one of our early tasks will be to try to at least agree a working definition – one that allows everyone to be clear about what we’re working towards.
Then we want to build on some of the projects already underway that touch on issues of integration, like the four community budget pilots that are cutting red tape and reducing duplication in specific areas.
We will take the lessons from those pilots and share them across the country, so everyone can benefit.
To gauge our progress, we will also take heed of the Future Forum’s calls to measure people’s experience of how their care is being integrated. We want to explore how best to do that via the outcomes frameworks, so integration is given just as much importance as any other big NHS issue.
We will use different payment systems to put money in the hands of people who can improve integration. The Year of Care tariffs, for example, which take a long-term view of people with long-term conditions. And we want to see similarly innovative payment systems across the health, care and housing sectors.
And of course, throughout all this, in the spirit of integration, I want to make it quite clear that expert organisations like the Kings Fund, the Nuffield Trust are central to everything we’re doing.
We have already accepted the Future Forum’s recommendation following the joint Kings Fund and Nuffield Trust report that far more work is needed to integrate all public services.
The White Paper said we would work with the NHS Commissioning Board, Monitor, and the Local Government Association to support evidence-based integration across the country.
And we have set up a new joint unit in DH across health and social care to look specifically at how the recommendations of your report can be taken forward.
But your input won’t stop there. I want to hear about your suggestions, your criticisms and your research. So every change made specifically to increase the integration of care is itself the product of co-operation and shared endeavour.
That is also true for publicly funded groups like the NHS Commissioning Board and Monitor. We will work closely with them to make sure we are reading off the same hymn sheet.
There isn’t enough time to go into all of it, but I’d also like to quickly mention some other measures in the Care and Support White Paper that will help integrate services:
• Personal health and care budgets, so people can control their own care.
• And more attention than ever paid to important ‘hand-off’ moments where someone’s care goes through a big transition – like when a terminal illness means someone starts using end-of-life services.
Those are all steps in the right direction.
But as I said earlier, for integration to work it can’t just be seen as a health issue, or a social care issue. Everyone has to buy into it and do their bit to make people healthier.
Health and wellbeing boards
Health and wellbeing boards will bring previously disparate people together to do just that.
The NHS, local government and communities themselves. To understand what local needs are and work out how to meet them.
I’m really delighted that you have all been so open with each other about your experiences of setting up health and wellbeing boards.
Through events like this, and through the National Learning Network for health and wellbeing boards, you are coming together with your colleagues around the country to share what you’ve learnt.
But like all ambitious changes, it won’t be easy.  A lot of ways of working will have to change. People will have to move out of their comfort zones and look at what is better for local people, not what is better for their own organisations.
Because this is about real change, not just meetings and working groups. If health and wellbeing boards are no more than committees then we will have failed.
The real work of health and wellbeing boards will be outside the boardrooms, with communities, providers, local organisations, voluntary and community groups, GP practices.
Leaders in all those groups will need to get better at working together. The NHS Leadership Academy, ADASS, LGA and the National Skills Academy will all help by developing skills and supporting individual leaders.
And the new Social Care Leadership Qualities Framework and Leadership Forum will help as well.
But in the end, it will come down to individual leaders themselves, and how willing they are to embrace a different way of working.
I’ve only been a minister for a week. But I’ve already got a clear picture of how grateful everyone in the Department of Health is to groups like the Kings Fund for the support they have given to projects like the National Learning Network for health and wellbeing boards.
I hope we can continue to work together to build on that.
So please, tell me about your experiences of how care can be brought together. What works and what doesn’t.
My roundtable will be one place we can discuss how to progress, but to be sure, this won’t be a here today, gone tomorrow issue.
I give you my word that I will push integration as hard as I can.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now if you want to really drive them crazy, you say 12 more years.
Because we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016. Let’s see what happens. We caught them doing some really bad things. We have to be very careful because they’re trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they’re working on, sending them out to people that didn’t ask for them, they didn’t ask, they just get them and it’s not fair and it’s not right and it’s not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion. It’s just my opinion. We have to be very, very careful, and you have to watch. Every one of you, you have to watch. Because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign and that goes to Biden and that goes to Obama and we have to be very, very careful. Have to be very, very careful, and this time they’re trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam. They’ll blame it on the Post Office. You can see them setting it up. Be very careful and watch it very carefully. Because we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. This is the most … For a long period of time, I would say, “Well 2016, how special was that evening? Was that one of the great …” That was one of the great evenings but we have to be very, very careful and we have to win.
Our country is counting on it. This is the biggest, this is it. Our country can go in a horrible, horrible direction or in an even greater direction and before the plague came in from China, that’s where we were going. We were going in a direction like we had never seen. The most successful economy in the history of our country, the best unemployment numbers in history for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, college students, bad students, good students, everybody. If you had a diploma, if you didn’t have a diploma, didn’t matter, you were doing well. Everybody was doing well and we were actually coming together.
You know success brings people together, maybe better than anything else. Success brings people, so many times they say we’re divided. Well we were very divided under President Obama, very divided. People have no idea how divided. They didn’t talk about it as much, they didn’t say it as much, but we were really coming together and I was speaking with Democrats all of a sudden because the success, the markets were at an all-time high and by the way, take a look at what’s happening with the markets. Take a look at your stocks. We’re very close to breaking the record and NASDAQ has already done it. You know NASDAQ has broken the record I think 16 times already during a pandemic. Hopefully we’ll call it the final phase of the pandemic.
Biden the other day said no he’d shut it down. He’d listen to some guy say and he’d shut it down. We just broke a record on jobs, an all-time record. There’s never been three months where we’ve put more people to work, over nine million people, and again, we’re just about ready to break the all-time stock market record. I mean you look at it, we’re just about ready to do it again and what that means is everything else is going to follow. Very small on Wall Street. Everything else is going to be there, the economy is coming up very rapidly, our farmers are doing well. Our farmers are doing well because I got China to give them $28 billion because they were targeted by China. I got the farmers $28 billion, 16 and 12. That’s why. So in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and all the difficulties during this period of time, but we’re getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success. Success brings unity and we were there, and then we got hit with the plague but we won’t forget that.
I just want to thank the people of North Carolina because to be honest with you, I felt an obligation to be here. You have a governor is in a total shutdown mood. I guarantee you on November 4 it will all open up, it will be fine like most Southern states. On November 4, you know these Democrat governors, they love shutdown until after the election’s over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible for the economy but our numbers are looking so good and frankly I used to say a V and people would say, “Well maybe not. I don’t think so.” Some would say no way. We have a super V, you’re right. It’s now looking like it’s a super V. Our automobile numbers are incredible, both used cars and brand new cars, our manufacturing number is incredible. We’re putting a lot of manufacturing jobs to work that the previous administration said you’d need a magic wand. You’d need a magic wand for manufacturing jobs, I don’t think so. I guess we had the magic wand, that’s all, but again, we’re putting them back, we’re bringing them back. But think of your life just prior to the plague coming in. It was the best it’s ever been. Your state had the best numbers they’ve ever had, ever had, by far, and we had the best employment numbers also.
We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere near that, and then we had to shut it down. We saved millions and millions of lives. We learned the enemy, we learned all about the invisible enemy, how it affects really people that are older, especially older people, the elderly, but older people with problems with heart and diabetes, with other problems, and we learned and most of the country is right now doing very, very well. They’ve done an incredible job and to have a man sitting on television the other day say, “Oh I’d shut it down. Oh I’d shut it.” Like it’s easy, shut it down. By the way, when you shut it down and we did the exact right thing, we shut it down, then we reopened and that’s what we’re doing now. We’re well into it, but … If we didn’t shut it down at that point, we would have had millions of people dead. Millions of people.
You see the numbers, the job that Mike Pence and the taskforce and all of us together have done has been incredible, what we’ve done, what we’ve achieved, whether it’s ventilators, whether it’s supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared. Many of the governors were totally ill-prepared. Nobody wants to say that but it’s supposed to work that way, federalist, it’s supposed to work that way. The governors are supposed to do it, and many of them did a fine job and many of them came back well. But most of them didn’t have the equipment that they should have had. Few of them had the ventilators which are very, very complex machines and hard to make and hard to manufacture and expensive and we’re right now making thousands of ventilators a month and we’re sending them, we have all we can use, our whole country, every state. We’re stocked, we’re stocked and I always say and I’ll say it again, there’s never been a person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get a ventilator.
Every single person that’s ever needed a ventilator, with all that you’ve heard with how much they said we didn’t have again, I took over a country whose military was depleted and whose cupboard on this front were bare. The cupboards were bare. We didn’t have anything. We didn’t have a thing. We had very, very little and we did a great job. We haven’t been given … And it’s not for me, it’s for the incredible people, the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses and yet you saw yesterday convalescent plasma, you saw remdesivir. You’ll soon see vaccines pouring out years ahead of what they would have been under a more traditional, let’s use that term because it’s nicer, a more traditional administration where they would have taken years to come up with this stuff. We’re coming up with it like nobody’s ever seen before. The FDA, Dr. Hahn I want to thank him, Alex Azar, I want to thank him. They’ve come with things and done things that have never been done in terms of speed and frankly in terms of quality. If you look at it what we’re doing and what we’re coming up with, drug companies are coming up with vaccines that are … I’ve seen some results already, it’s going to be very, very soon. They’re in Stage III trials. It’s unheard of. We wouldn’t be there for two years if this were a more normal situation.
So I just want to thank everybody for being here and again I felt an obligation to come to North Carolina. It’s been a place that’s been very good to me. You know we won a lot of victories here. I haven’t been doing this that long but I won every chance I had in North Carolina. I even stole a great chief of staff, Mark Meadows, right? I stole him from North Carolina, and he left Congress as a very popular guy. Could have been there for a long time if he wanted and he came in and by the way, you have a fantastic young gentleman going to take his place, he’s a fantastic young guy and he’s going to be a real star in the party. He’s going to be a real star in the party.
So I just want to thank everybody from North Carolina and I do want to show a little bit of a difference because another state that’s been very good to me is Wisconsin and Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee and they didn’t go there at all, they didn’t do this. We did this out of respect for your state. We didn’t do this for any other reason other than respect for the state of North Carolina. Because we said we wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina and I think you’re going to remember that frankly on November 3. We wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina. So I did that out of respect, and if you had a governor that would have let us have some people. He actually told me this, we had an arena that holds 19,000 people, it was totally jammed, sold out, every hotel was full, everything, and I called him, he said, “But we have a shutdown going on and according to the rules and regulations …” Now this is 19,000, he did say it. I don’t think he’ll deny it, but he said, “According to the rules and regulations, the most people you’re allowed to have in that room,” meaning that arena, he viewed it as a room, “Is 10 people.”
I say, “So Governor, so I’m at 19,000, you’re at 10. Can we work something in the middle.” It didn’t sound too good, so we really had no choice. It was a terrible thing but I felt so badly because you could have … I mean economic development money, all of the things that happen, but we decided, I was with Ronna, the vice president, everybody, Mark, and we said let’s have our big deal, the roll call, let’s have it right here and let’s do it and I’m going to show up and I’m not going to tell anybody. Until a few minutes ago nobody knew I was coming. Nobody knew I was coming. But what’s more important than the roll call? You’re the ones calling it so what’s more important –
I have to tell you, we’re going to do a lot of things. I’m just going to go over very briefly because we’re going to make a speech on Thursday night, I hope you’re all going to be listening. Because I came in, I’m on Air Force One and Air Force One has more televisions that any plane in history. They’ve got them in closets, they’ve got them on ceilings, floors. They’ve got more … You can’t escape a television, and I turned to CNN and they didn’t have this. They weren’t having it, can you believe it? They didn’t have it. No no, CNN didn’t have our roll call. Then I turned to MSDNC as I call it. MSDNC which is truly, it is a branch of the Democrats. It’s a I wouldn’t say fully owned corporation but it’s certainly a fully controlled or they control them, nobody really knows who’s controlling who but they had it on television. I remember watching it, it was interesting. You see the difference states and we say this and we say that, the great state of Alaska, the great state of Alabama, the great state of North Carolina, the great state of all of them, and it’s very interesting –
… Carolina. The great state of all of them. And it’s very interesting to me. They had theirs on, but they didn’t show it. Instead, they’re showing the scam because they’re trying to show the post office so that when their whole mail-in thing fizzles, they’ll try blaming it on the post office. Okay. So they show in these hearings that are very boring actually and they’re not showing you this either. They weren’t showing this. And Fox had it on, but unfortunately, Fox wasn’t showing it too much because they had the announcers talking, talking, talking. I said, ” I want to hear what they’re saying, the delegates. I want to hear what they’re saying.” So I think we had to switch over to CSPAN or to OAN or somebody. But I wanted to hear them.
But I can promise you a few things. Number one, we will not be taking the word, God, out of The Pledge of Allegiance. Okay. Like they did a number of times at their caucuses, so they took the word God out. I heard it. I was listening and I said, “That’s strange.” It’s sort of weird. You’ve heard it all your life, right? Under God, under God. All of a sudden, those two words are missing. I said, “Oh, he must’ve made a mistake.” Maybe the teleprompter wasn’t working or his book wasn’t working that I have right here. Something wasn’t working. I must admit. But the problem was then the next day I heard it again. And I said, “That’s not a mistake.” And then they immediately went into a mode, “Oh, no, no, no, no. We didn’t mean that. No, no. We didn’t say if for the convention. We didn’t say it.” No, that’s where they’re coming from. That’s where they’re coming from. You can say it or not say it. That is where they’re coming from.
Just like with energy, they don’t want energy. Not working well in Texas, by the way. I just looked at a poll. And by the way, it just came out that we have received 51% in the big and very important Rasmussen poll, and my numbers actually went up during the Democratic National Convention, 51%. So, think of it.
Thank you.
I love this state.
Think of it-
Thank you.
I love this state. I like this place and you’re from all over the place. But this has been a good one for me. No, but think of it, so we’re at 51% in Rasmussen. Do you read about it? Do you hear about it?. You don’t hear about it. They give you these suppression polls, where they do registered voters instead of most likely. It’s supposed to be likely, likely. In other words, how about you, you’re likely to vote. But how about you, you’re registered, but I’m not voting. But see, under their plan where they send these ballots, you don’t have to want to vote. You get the ballot and then they have harvesting. They get guys to go, “Do you want to vote?” “No, not really, but I have a ballot.” “All right, good. Who’s it for?” “Sleepy Joe Biden.” “Now put it here, sign. Okay. Could I have it?” And they’ll take it.
In fact, harvesting is illegal in your state. They wanted to put a Republican, a fine man, a pastor, they wanted to put them in jail because he harvested. Now they want to make harvesting legal all of a sudden. They’ll put him in jail as a Republican, right? If he was a Democrat, they wouldn’t even be thinking about it. In California, they do the same thing. No repercussion. In North Carolina, you had a fine pastor, a fine man, and they got him on harvesting and they wanted to put them in jail. And now they want to make it all so that everybody can harvest because they know it’s not a good thing.
So people that don’t want to vote are going to be sitting there, there’ll be making them … If you talk about 80 million ballots, it’s 80 million, it could even be higher than that. I used to say 51 million, now it’s 80 million. They said, “Sir, you’re a little obsolete with the 50.” I said, “All right, what is it?” “80.” I said, “80.” How is it possible? Think of it, they’ll be sending them, they’ll be dumping them in neighborhoods. People are going to be picking them up. They’ll be bribing. They’ll be paying off people to grab some. This is going to be one of the greatest scams. And it’s common sense. This has nothing to do with politics. It’s common sense. Anybody, you don’t have to know politics, they’re going to mail out 80 million ballots. It’s impossible. They have no idea.
Who’s mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Well, supposing they don’t mail them to Republican neighborhoods. That means they’re not going to get them. So they’re going to complain and the election’s going to be over. And then they’re going to complain. And then they’ll say, “Oh, well, we didn’t get it. Big deal.” In the meantime, you might lose the election. This is the greatest scam in the history of politics, I think, and I’m talking about beyond our nation. And they act like they’re aggrieved. Like by saying this, we’re saying such a horrible thing. We’re not patriotic by saying this. No, we voted during World War I. We voted at the voting booth during World War II. The pandemic, we’re doing very well and people know how to handle it. Look at the crowds. They’re doing very well. It’s very safe. It’s going to be very safe. If you have an absentee ballot where you request it, we’re all in favor of that. Absentee, like in Florida, they have absentee is good.
But other than that, they’re very, very bad. There’ll be millions of ballots. Take a look at New York, take a look at Virginia, take a look at New Jersey, all different cases. They just had one last night. Now they’re thinking about recalling certain elections that took place with mail-in, and these are small elections that are locally based that are easy to run, not millions, but thousands of ballots, thousands, hundreds of ballots. But these are small, and they can’t control it. They said 23% of the ballots were defective. What does defective mean? It means fraud. It means a lot of things that we won’t get into because I don’t want to be accused. You see all the cameras back there. It’s the fake news. I don’t want to be accused of anything. But what it means is they’re trying to steal the election from the Republicans, that’s what it means. In a very, very nice way, I will tell you they are trying to steal the election just like they did it last time with spying and we caught them, and that included President Obama and that included-
Let’s be nice. Biden. This could only happen in North Carolina. But that included them and they got caught. And then somebody said, “Well, what are you going to do?” ” Well, we can attack a president.” Oh, I see. If it was me … They say we can’t attack a president. We caught him. We caught him cold and they say, we can’t attack. He was at meetings talking about it. And by the way, this was spying before and after. And I think it’s a disgrace to our country. I think we can never let that happen again. But now they’re doing something that in a certain way is more dangerous because it’s more effective. They spied on my campaign, you know what they found, nothing. But this is big stuff. This is stealing millions of votes. And it’s going to be very hard.
Now we’re in courts all over the country. And hopefully, we have judges that are going to give it a fair call because if they give it a fair call, we’re going to win this election. The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election. We’re going to win this election.
We’re going to win this election.
I’m just saying we cannot have these live, we call them live, some people call them universal, I like the word live, these live mail-in ballots sent to everybody, including mostly people that never asked for them. Think of it. You’re sitting there, you get a ballot. Here’s the bottom line. It was just given that in the polls believe it or not because the polls try and treat us right. That’s why I respect Rasmussen because they did well. A few of the others feel the same way, and they did well last time. Those are the ones that I look at. The ones that did well last time and Rasmussen was very good.
But if you look at it, every single vote that they have, every single vote it’s going to be looked at. A man is sitting, or a woman is sitting, waiting for nothing, watching television, has no enthusiasm. Because on enthusiasm, the polls are saying that I’m up by massive numbers, not just a little. I’m also way up on the economy, by the way, put at the top. Way, way up. But I’m up by massive, and when I say I’m up, I’m talking about we’re up. Okay.
But I’m up by massive numbers on enthusiasm. So our voters are saying, “I’m very angry about this. I’ll go to the poll directly and vote.” But that vote is the saying, “I don’t care if Biden gets in.” He doesn’t have any enthusiasm. When you go to Ohio, when you go to Wisconsin, when you go to North Carolina, when you go to a lot of states, they have the Trump-Pence sign on every lawn. It’s all over the place, right? It’s all over.
Indiana too. Indiana is great. Bobby Knight. We love Bobby Knight too. I’ll tell you, we love Bobby Knight and Coach Oates and all of them. They love us. And we love them. Indiana is great. Thank you. But here’s the thing. So if they don’t have any enthusiasm, so you’d say, “Are you going to vote?” “I’m not getting up to vote.” Okay. “I want to watch television instead of vote.” All right. But here’s a ballot. It just got to you. And he opens it. Oh, here’s a ballet. What the hell am I going to do with this thing? And then they have somebody knocking on your door and they’re harvesting. “Hey, have you gotten your ballot?” “Yeah, I have my ballot.” “You going to sign it?” “Well, if you want, I’ll sign it. Here it is. Get out of here.” That’s the most honest way of doing it, and that’s unfair.
That’s unfair because now they’re taking all of that enthusiasm that our party has, and we have tremendous enthusiasm. I think we have record enthusiasm. We have a base the likes of which nobody’s seen, including these people. Wall Street Journal did a fantastic story this weekend, a fantastic cover story this weekend on the base. It’s an incredible base. Everybody here is going to vote everybody in our base. I mean, we have a tremendous base. They don’t. They have no enthusiasm for their candidate. Because frankly, Bernie Sanders, they have much more enthusiasm for him. But Bernie Sanders, excuse me, again, he’s the greatest loser I’ve ever seen. This guy can lose and be so happy. Hillary Clinton, I want to use nice language so I don’t want to a use certain word. It starts with the word S-C. I don’t want to use it because they’ll say he used foul language while in North Carolina. So I won’t do that.
But Bernie Sanders got taken advantage of, is that okay, by Hillary Clinton, but worse by the Democrats this time because of Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren got out of the campaign one day prior to the Super Tuesday vote, Bernie Sanders would have won every single state because Biden won by a little bit. She didn’t do well, but she took thousands and thousands of votes away and he stayed. If you add just a percentage of those votes back, that means that Bernie would have won easily the nomination. And I’m glad he didn’t because he had much more enthusiasm. And he would have had a base, a much smaller base than ours, but equally, I have to say this, equally as enthusiastic. This base doesn’t like Joe Biden. They don’t like Joe Biden. I think we’re going to get a lot of votes. We did last time. People were surprised. Primarily because of trade because I know how other countries take advantage of us, and I understand that, and that’s something that Bernie Sanders people really feel because I understand trade. I’ve done USMCA now.
China tariffs. I mean, China had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years prior to the plague. The worst year they’ve had in decades and decades and we had the best year we’ve ever had. But we took in billions from China. We never took in 25 cents from China, never took in 25 cents. China for 25 years, and not only Obama, for 25 years China was taken in anywhere between 200 billion with a B and $550 billion from the United States.
I give them all the credit, number one for being smart and outfoxing all of the people that stood here and their representatives, but China, we built China. We helped build. We gave them three, four, $500 billion a year because before that, and before the World Trade Organization and they getting into it, China was flat line. China was … It was after that happened. And then they took advantage of us because we didn’t have people that were smart enough to see. And by the way, Biden would be the worst of all of them because his son took out one and a half billion dollars and he gets fees on one and a half billion, which is millions of dollars a year. Give me a break. China will own our country if this guy gets elected. We can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen.
So, we have a big one coming.
… So we have a big one coming. And just to finish, enthusiasm. So they take the enthusiasm now out of the equation, because they’re going to go knock on everybody’s door. Here, would you sign this? Yeah, I’ll sign it. Nobody knows who the hell is signing it. And they now want to have it where the signature doesn’t have to be verified. That’s right. The signature doesn’t have to be verified. And then they’re going to play the game that we’re not patriotic. What they’re doing is using COVID to steal an election. They’re using COVID to defraud the American people, all of our people, of a fair and free election. And we can’t do that. And don’t let them give you the Post Office stuff. The Postal Service, they do a great job. Lose a lot of money. I’ve said if they charged Amazon and these companies doing that, a couple of dollars more a package, that Amazon has to pay, not the customer.
You know what happened? Post Office would start doing very well, thank you. Amazon dumps all the packages. Why should we deliver it? We’ll let the Post Office do it and lose a fortune. So if they charged Amazon, now of course, he owns the Washington Post. So when I get bad stories in the Washington Post, I wonder why, right? I wonder why. But I just tell it like it is, right? I tell it like it is. We’ve accomplished more. We’ve accomplished more during the first three and a half years of this administration than any president in the history of our country. And I’m not even getting push back. I’ve been saying this for two years, for three years, I used to say for two years, for three years. But we’ve done more, let’s say just about. This way they can’t say, “Well, somebody won a war, or something.” Right? No, no. We’ve accomplished more than just about any administration in the history of our country. We’ve secured our borders.
We’ve built our wall, which will be finished very shortly. We brought back manufacturing jobs. We’ve defeated the entire… Defeated the ISIS caliphate and killed al-Baghdadi. We also killed the greatest, biggest terrorist maybe of them all, Soleimani. We killed Soleimani, right? And al-Baghdadi. We appointed 300 new judges. By the end of the first term, we will have appointed 300. It’s an unheard of number. That’s because president Obama was very nice and he gave me 142 openings. And historically, you get no open. When you become president. First question, you say, “How many judges?” They’ll say, “None, sir.” Because the other previous president, they want to… It’s a very important thing, federal judges.
We will have appointed 300, could be even more than that by the end of the first term. And I sat down, I said, first day, I said, “How many judges do I get to appoint?” They said, “Sir, 142.” I said, “100…” Because you know what? He thought that Hillary was going to win. Right? And the Republicans did not make it easy, let’s say. But if you have enough time, there’s not much anybody can do about it. We ended up with 142 judges. And now we’ve added many, many, and we’re going to end up with 300 and two great Supreme Court justices.
And remember this, I’m saying that I’m… I’m demanding actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he’s going to appoint. That he’ll take them out, like I did. I had 25 and we’re going to take it out of that list. And we’re going to be announcing a list over the next couple of weeks with the judges that we had, plus we might add a few more. So you know exactly where we stand. He can’t do it, because he would appoint… It’s not him. He has no choice. The radical left will demand that he appoints super radical, left, wild, crazy justices. Going into the Supreme Court, your American dream will be dead if that happens. It’ll be dead. And by the way, the next president… So I’ve had two. Some presidents have had none. I have had to in a relatively short period of time. But I will tell you that the next one could have two, three, four, and even five.
The next president. This is so important. This is so… Whether you’re talking about life, whether you’re talking about second amendment, whether you’re talking about military, this is so important. We have to do this. We have to win this election. But we brought back manufacturing. We rebuilt our military. We wiped out ISIS. I mean, think of it. When I came, ISIS was all over Iraq. The Prime Minister of Iraq was in last week and he said, “I want to thank you for defeating ISIS.” I said, “Now, are you talking about me or the United States?” “You, because when you came into office, it was a mess. They were all over Iraq and Syria, and you defeated them, sir.” I said, “Good. Tell that to the media, please. Would you do that?” And he said, “I will.” So let’s say he does. But we passed the biggest tax cuts and regulations cuts in the history of our country.
We replaced the worst trade deal ever made, NAFTA, with a great USMCA deal, that’s going to keep our companies here and it’s going to be treating us very nicely. And I wouldn’t say the other two countries were thrilled with it, but they were happy enough. And we did that. And that’s another thing, they said, “You’ll never be able to replace NAFTA. You’ll never be able to get it.” And I got it. We got it through Congress. We fixed a lot of our broken and bad trade deals. We’re getting 40 billion now from Japan. We fixed a horrible deal that was made with South Korea. Remember, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, “This will produce 250,000 jobs.” And she was right. Except unfortunately, the jobs went to South Korea, not to us. She said it would produce 250,000 jobs. And it did, to South Korea. And we stood up to China like nobody’s ever stood up. Between the tariffs and the trade deal, which now… Don’t forget, when I made that the ink wasn’t dry before the China virus poured into our country, right?
The ink wasn’t dry. So I view that differently than I would have, because it’s done very well. In the last week they had the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans. They are doing things… They’re very smart. A lot of people, because they see my attitude. A lot of people would say, “We’re not going to order.” They do just the opposite. I got a call last week, “Sir…” In fact, Sonny Purdue is here. The great Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. There he is. Is that right, Sonny? I got a call. They ordered the largest, it was the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Twice. Twice. The largest order of corn. The largest order of soybeans.
Here’s how smart, somebody else would say, running some country. They’d say, “Well, we’re not going to do business with him. He’s not saying nice things about…” China’s very smart. Instead, they order more corn than we’ve ever thought possible. Right, Sonny? Order more soybeans than we ever thought possible. And now I have farmers calling me up, “Sir, we love China very much. Please don’t be too tough on them.” It makes it very difficult, Sonny, right? We do too good a job sometimes. We’ve achieved American energy independence. And we’re now number one in the world, by far.
And I saw where these phonies, you know they want to end everything we’ve done. They want to end it. They want to go to wind. They don’t even know if they want to go to wind. I think they want to just basically close up our country, because they’ve taken away our strength, but they want to do something. But, there is no such thing. Solar can’t do it. I love solar. It’s all fine. Very, very heavily expensive. Very expensive. But they want to go to other forms of alternative energy. And I think that’s okay, except we don’t have them. And it’s not going to power these massive factories.
And hydro, I love. It’s one of my all time favorites. Hydro, I love. I have to tell you. That’s the Great Dams. You don’t see that too much. You know why? The environmentalist say, “You can’t build a dam there.” But now we can, because we’ve done-
We’ve done things that nobody thought were possible. Like example, the Keystone pipeline. We got that approved. The Dakota Access pipeline. They were all bogged down, right? Right? We’ve got things that they said you couldn’t get done. We’re energy independence. And they said, “We want to ban fracking.” No fracking. How do you think they’ll do in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota? Louisiana is going to love it. There’s no fracking. There’s basically… They want no fossil fuel whatsoever. Okay? No gas, no oil, no coal. No nothing. Okay.
So they don’t want anything. Now, they’re getting killed. Because a poll just came out in Texas. Texas wasn’t happy. They want no guns. They want no oil and gas. And they want no God. No God. It’s no religion, no guns, no oil and gas. I don’t think you’re going to do too good in Texas. George Washington could come back from the dead and he could choose as his VP candidate, the late great Abraham Lincoln. And you’re not going to win the state of Texas if you have no oil, no guns and no religion. I don’t think so.
I don’t think so. You’re not going to win too many places. We eliminated Obamacare’s horrible and very unfair individual mandate, which basically knocked out Obamacare. We knocked out Obamacare. We’ve protected your second amendment. So important. We’re protected the second amendment. We’ve cut drug prices, first time in 51 years, we got drug prices down. Now, I’m really doing it. I did a favored nations clause. Meaning, we pay the same price as the lowest country that has the best deal. The companies are going crazy. The drug companies. They’re taking ads on me. I said… I went to Mark Meadows. I said, “Mark, they’re killing me.” They have nothing but cash. Okay? Big pharma, they call it for a reason. There’s nobody that gives the politicians more money than big pharma. Nobody. Not even close. So I said, “Well look, if you’re not going to negotiate a fair deal, we’re going to do a favored nations clause.” To the top people, the biggest guys.
They said, “No, don’t do that, favored nations.” Favored nations, because you know, we have countries out there that are paying a tiny fraction of what our people are expected to pay. So if you have a country, Germany or others, they make… By the way, UK, all of Europe, Canada pays 50%, 5-0. 50% less. In fact, people leave our country, go to Canada, and pick up their drugs and they come back home. Can you believe that? This is the kind of difference. So I said, “No, I want a favored nations clause. I also want a rebate clause.” A rebate, where instead of the money going to the middleman, who have to be the richest people in the world. They get so much. They get more money, frankly, than the drug companies. At least the drug companies make a product. So I wiped out the rebate, where now it goes to people. And I instituted what’s called a favored nations clause.
And it’s very simple. You have that in deals. It’s whatever the lowest price in the world, we’re the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. So whatever the lowest price is that other countries pay. So if you have a country paying 25 cents for a pill and we’re paying $2.50 cents, and it’s not such an exaggeration, believe me, then we get it for 10. So what happens is that doesn’t work. So they’ll go up a little bit. We’ll come way, way down. So I said, “Favored nations. I want to pay what the lowest price is anywhere in the world. We’re the biggest purchaser, we want a favored nations.”
They had a heart attack. And then I signed it. They didn’t believe it. And now what they’re doing is they have ads, millions and millions of dollars worth of ads, that I’ve been horrible to the people because of drugs. And I believe in socialism. Socialism. You know why? Because some of the socialistic countries get the lowest price. So the only thing I have with socialism is I wanted to get their price. Okay. That’s the only thing. Other than that is our country will never be a socialist country.
So we cut drug crisis. And you could get cuts. You could get cuts.
You could get cuts as much as 50, 60 or 70%, maybe even more than that, on prescription drug prices. And wouldn’t it be a kick… I’ll use this, wouldn’t it be a kick in the ass if I lost and sleepy Joe is president, and this thing kicks in right about soon, right? In 30, 40 days. And people wake up after the election. Boy, Biden’s done a great job. My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great-
My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great president he’s been. He’s great. And sleepy Joe would say, I thought about that, but everybody knew about favorite nations, but nobody had the guts to do it. And I’ll tell you, I was called by many politicians, please don’t do it, sir. Please. I said, “why?” They don’t want to tell me why. I know why. Because they’re politicians and they’ve been helped out and I guess we have to understand that too. But the fact is that we signed a favorite nations clause and a rebate clause, and your numbers are going to come down 60, 70%. And I hope you remember that on November 3rd, because nobody but me would ever do it.
The other thing I’ve done aside from very strongly protecting your Second Amendment, which was not easy. That was not easy. And by the way, they will take your guns away as sure as you’re standing or sitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and you see how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic they let them riot every night. We’re saying, let us come in and solve your problem. We will solve it for you in one hour just like we did in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right? Five nights, six nights, they have to ask us in. Let us come in. We’ll solve your problem.
They’re almost used to it. This is the way our whole country would be if you ever let a thing like this happen, our whole country would be. So we protected your preexisting conditions, very strongly protected… and you don’t hear that. But we very strongly protected your preexisting condition. So we got rid of the horrible individual mandate, which cost everybody a fortune and we strongly protected. Every Republican is sworn to protecting your pre existing conditions. It’s very important. You won’t hear that. You won’t hear that from the fake news. We passed Right to Try. We passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. We mobilized the largest response since the Second World War. We are doing an incredible job on the China virus, but I’m going to talk to you about that Thursday night. Will anybody be listening on Thursday night?
And just very quickly, in the second term among many other things, we’ll continue with our military. We built the strongest military by far. It was depleted. A nice Marine back there. It was depleted like you wouldn’t believe. We have the best jets and rockets and equipment of any kind, tanks. Tanks made in Ohio. Lima. Tanks made in Ohio. So we’re going to create 10 million jobs, I think very easily, in the first 10 months. They want to raise your taxes. All my life I’ve heard as a politician, you like to lower taxes, right? This is the only election where somebody said we’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your taxes, quadruple your taxes. They’re going to add on to the regulations. There all of these projects that we got started that are great projects, they won’t be able to get built.
So they’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your regulations, make it impossible to build a highway. It used to take 17 years, 18 years, 20 years, 21 years, long time in some cases, to get approval to build a highway, right? We have it down to two years now, we’re going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we’re going to know it very quickly. We’re not going to take 17 years. We could name highways. They took forever. End up costing a hundred times more and they’re not as good. Some of them go in circles, I mean, to get to a point. Let’s spend 37 million to… look, we’ve got to be smart. Got to be smart. We’ve got to win an election. Also, we’re going to create tax credits for companies that bring our jobs back from China and other countries and impose tariffs on countries that take advantage of the United States.
They’ve been taking advantage of us for years and years, and I’ve already done it in certain cases. We have countries that tariff us and we don’t tariff them. So they tariff us. It’s very simple. It’s called reciprocal. They tariff us, we tariff them. We are going to fully fund law enforcement and hire more police. We’re going to go with school choice and we’ve made a lot of progress on school choice for every student in America. We’re going to continue to expand opportunities zones. There has been nothing better. Don’t forget. It was us, us together that got criminal justice reform done. The greatest thing for the black community, African American community. They came and they said, “We can’t believe it. Obama didn’t even try.” And not only that, I got funded, the historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They weren’t funded. They were year to year. They didn’t know if they were going to be around for another year and they’d come in to the White House.
And after three years, I said, “Why do you guys keep coming back?” Well, it’s a year to your deal. I said, “That’s not fair. So you have to come back every year.” And we got them longterm financing and longterm funding. Nobody’s done more for the historically black colleges and universities than Donald Trump. Nobody. Nobody’s done more for the African American community. No president has done as much as anybody since, I mean, since, and I say it, since Abraham Lincoln. It’s true. It’s true. Criminal justice reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. He’s a great senator, he’s a great gentleman. Tim Scott is fantastic. Opportunities zones. But think of it, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, the colleges and universities. What we’ve done has been amazing. But the most important thing is prior to the virus, the greatest job numbers in the history of the African American community, the Hispanic community and the Asian, as I said. So I just want to thank everybody. We’re going to get rid of our sanctuary cities as soon as we can so that they don’t protect.
We put NASA back in action. NASA had grass growing through its runway. It had grass growing through the cracks of its runways. It was closed, essentially, just a disaster. Now it’s the number one space center anywhere in the world by far. You saw the ships going up. And for some reason, a lot of rich people like rockets going up. And so we say, let’s lease them our beautiful launching areas and let them send all the rockets, let them pay for it. But we’ll be landing on Mars. We’re going to the moon. We’re go into Mars. We’ll be the first on Mars. Let’s see if that happens. We have to do it. If we hear it’s going to happen. If somebody else is here, you’re probably not. But I just want to, again, thank… I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You’re incredible warriors. You have incredible strength. You have unbelievable intelligence and patience. It’s a combination of both. I don’t know which is greater, the intelligence or the patience, but let’s assume it’s the intelligence. But I have to tell you, I think we have the greatest base of support anywhere at any time, any election and people are starting to find that out. They found it out in 2016. And I will be honest, this election, I believe we have far greater enthusiasm in this election. And we had a level that was a record because they still don’t believe what happened. They said, “Where are all these people coming from?” Right? People that were great Americans that never voted, because they didn’t like who they were watching or looking. People were great, they didn’t vote. I’ll never forget, a Congressman from Tennessee came up. They do very early voting. Tennessee, a great state. And they had just started voting. And I was in Pennsylvania making a speech.
And he said, “Sir, I don’t know. I can’t speak for anybody, but I’m from Tennessee and I’ve been doing this for a long time.” He said, “I’ve never seen anything like it. People are coming from the valleys and the hilltops. And they’re coming from the cities. They’re coming from all over. I never say, they’re coming out of the rivers. They’re coming along those beautiful war fields that we have. They’re coming from everywhere, sir. I’ve never seen anything like it.” But if other States are like Tennessee, you’re going to win this election. He was the first one to say it. He was the first one. They came from the mountains. They came from everywhere. He said, “I’ve never seen anything like it.” And people they’d be having Trump pins and the hats. These are people that never were political people. They never wore a pin in their life having to do with politics. It’s been an incredible experience for me. It’s been an incredible experience, I think, for everyone. And I’ll tell you what, next year is going to be an incredible… it’s going to be a great, great year.
It’s going to be a year of tremendous success. We’re fighting off this horrible thing that was delivered by China. And it was by China and we’re never going to forget it and I let them know. We’re never going to forget what they did because you know what. But we can never forget the 175,000 people, which will go up. Remember this though, we saved millions because if we didn’t move and if I didn’t put the ban on highly heavily infected people coming to our nation from China, that everybody told me not to do. Months later, they were saying we shouldn’t… and then they all either apologized or admitted it was right. And Europe. I did Europe too, very early. If we didn’t do that, our numbers would be at a level like you wouldn’t believe.
So, I just want to thank everybody for this incredible support. Be very, very careful. This is going to be, and I really believe this. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Don’t let them take it away from you. Don’t let them take it away. North Carolina, we love you. That’s why I’m here. Thank you very much. Very special people. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you.
"
Donald Trump,"This is really exciting, what a beautiful. This is great. Thank you all.
Well, I think it's really a waste of time, honestly. If Indiana treats us right, we're going to make America great again. We're going to get rid of these politicians. And we're going to do the right job. I mean, two days ago it was Kasich, they were going to form an alliance and they were going to collude and they were going to get together.
And then all of a sudden Kasich didn't live up to his side of the deal and they're fighting with each other. And now he's doing the Carly thing. I just don't see it. It's awfully early. Number one, it's very early. I mean, you're not supposed to be doing it this early. But I don't see it.
Well, I have a lot of great people, I just don't want to talk about it now. I would like to finish the deal first. You know, Cruz has no path to victory and neither does Kasich. And once the deal is done, you'll be -- maybe, I'll make you the first to know, right?
We'll make it a first. But we'll let you know. We have some really great people. But I just think it's so early in the process. You have to first get the nomination. Here's the guy picking a vice presidential candidate, he has zero chance. He has no path. It's sort of crazy. So I think it's -- well, it gets him in the news cycle because he has been totally taken out.
He had a horrible day yesterday. And he came in third, meaning third out of three, most of the time. And he picked up no delegates. And, you know, we're talking about major states like Pennsylvania, like Maryland. I mean, we're talking about big stuff.
And Connecticut. He came in -- he got nothing. And I think he wanted to do something to get out of that negative cycle. And in that sense it was probably good for him. But people will not like it.
Well, necessary, and victory. Number one, I define necessary as protecting our country. That's what necessary is, is protecting our country. It was interesting, I got a big hand, I appreciate it, because I said, I'm only going to send them in if we're going to win. We have to win.
We don't win. And, you know, as a country, you can look at trade, you can look at -- we don't win anymore. We just don't win. But even with our military we have these incredible people, but we're not taking care of them properly. It's being depleted. Our vets are being taken care of horribly. That's going to change immediately.
That I can tell you. And it was a long time ago. We haven't been winning so much. But we certainly aren't winning now in any capacity.
Well, I think what I'm -- to me, when I heard the other day, I heard President Obama say the single greatest threat to our country global warming. Was he being serious? And the big threat we have is global warming, but it's of the nuclear variety. That's the biggest threat we have.
. And frankly, if it weren't for that capability and the incredible power of weaponry today, I would have been out of there a long time. I said, and you know this because I've been saying this to you for years, don't go into Iraq, don't go into Iraq, because we totally destroyed the balance of power, we destroyed the whole equilibrium of the Middle East.
And now Iran is taking over the Middle East. And it's terrible. I mean, if we didn't do anything in the last 15 years, if we just forgot the Middle East was there we would be in such great shape today by comparison to what we've done, with the migration, with people pouring into our country, which is Obama's fault, in all fairness, because we're taking tens of thousands of people into the United States.
We have no idea, Greta, who they are. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. But victory to me is victory. If we go in to fight, we have to fight to win and get it over with, fast.
They're having a field day with us. And it's a form of extortion, if you want to know the truth. I mean, it really is. It's a form of extortion. And that's what I think they're doing it for. But, look, you have South Korea, we protect them, and they're a monster in terms of economics, OK? Any time you order a television set, whether it's LG or Samsung or whatever it comes from, essentially South Korea.
They build the biggest ships. They build everything. And we protect them. And they pay us very little. And we protect many other countries. Part of the speech was that. We have to get reimbursed. You know, this is a.
All right. Here's what we do. Here's what we do. China has tremendous power over North Korea, tremendous, beyond anybody. Now they don't tell us that. They like to tweak us and say, well, we don't really. They have total control. China can't even survive without us because economically they've been ripping us for many years to come.
They've been sucking our blood. I look at Indiana, the jobs.
No, no. You tell them, we're going to -- either you're going to have to straighten out this North Korea problem or we're not going to be doing so much business with you. They don't do so much business with us, Greta, they would have a depression the likes of which you've ever seen. We have tremendous power, economic power over China.
And I want to get along with China. We're going to get along with China. But China can strangle because it comes in through China. And China is powerful. China can strangle North Korea. It can make them -- bring them to the table.
I think it can be very quick.
I think it can be very, very quick. But, you know, at what point are we the guardian of the world? At what point are we willing to say, folks, you have to protect yourselves? Or you have to pay us properly, OK? Or you have to pay us properly.
And the country is not business-minded. Politicians aren't business-minded. But I say it all the time, we protect Japan. Great people. We protect Saudi Arabia. We protect South Korea. We protect so many countries. And we could take Germany. Look at Germany. It's an economic behemoth. They have so much money, so much.
We protect Germany. Now it's OK to protect them. And I understand that we don't want them to arm ideally and all of that. But at what point do we say, we can't afford to do this anymore as a country? You'll have to protect yourselves or you're going to have to pay up. And whether it's South Korea, any of these.
Look at Saudi Arabia, before the oil went down -- now they're still making plenty, but before the oil prices went down they were making $1 billion a day. We protect them. They wouldn't be there, in my opinion, Greta, they wouldn't be there, Saudi Arabia wouldn't be there for two weeks if we weren't protecting them.
It would be a mess like you've never seen before. So we have to get smart and we have to help our allies and we have to be good to our allies, but they have to remember that we're good and they have to take care of us.
Did she say always vote for Trump?
Oh, that's good. That's what I thought you said.
OK. So such a great question. And, you know, I was looking at Indiana because I always get these statisticians. I said, give me the list, always like 15 minutes before I get to a place. I did it last week with New York, New York State. And it's all the same problems. I did it with Pennsylvania. I did it with every place I've been to in the last couple of weeks.
And I look at the numbers and our jobs, look at Carrier air conditioning, you know, in a way that's just a larger version of what's happening with your father where jobs are being just ripped out of our country, out of our states, but out of country. And we've got to a couple of things. When they want to play games with us, countries or companies, when a company wants to leave like Carrier, and they want to go to Mexico, and they're going to make air conditioners and they're send them, and we're not going to tax them, and they're going to let the 1,400 people from Indianapolis go, they're going to fire them, there has got to be consequences.
And the same thing with your father. When countries are able to do numbers on us, there are going to be consequences. And we're going to have to do some form of taxation. I believe totally in the free market, I think it's great. But our leaders are not smart. They're not smart people, or they're controlled by their special interest groups that have reasons for letting it be this way, one or the other.
. I'm working for your father, OK. And then somebody will say, oh, they're going to cost more.
And they're right. They're going to cost more. In some cases they're going to cost a little more. In some cases, like Carrier, they're not even going to cost more, but we have to tax the product coming in. And what's going to happen, the second part is we're going to have more workers. We're going to have more people.
We're going to have more jobs. So maybe the product is going to be a little more expensive. But you're going to have more jobs. So that's the good news. As far as health care, we're going to repeal Obamacare. We're going to replace it with something great, OK.
You know, the amazing thing about health care, if we get rid of the lines wrapped around every state -- you know, because this is all done for the benefit of the insurance companies, where could have real competition, whether it's health care savings accounts or so many different things. There are so many things you could have privately to take care of health care.
Obamacare is out of control. Your premiums are going up 25, 35, 45, 55 percent. We're going to repeal it. We're going to replace it with something great. Thank you, great question.
Yes.
OK. Well, first of all, I think you did the right thing by switching because I think that they're -- what they did in colluding like that, I think it was such a slap in the face of the people of Indiana, in particular. And, you know, I think actually you couldn't go to Cruz because I think it was equal if not worse.
And I just think it was terrible what they were doing. And I guarantee you if they had it to do again, especially Cruz, he would have never done it. Typical politicians, always make bad deals. And on top of it, Kasich then broke the deal. He said, no, I want you to vote for me in Indiana. He broke the deal.
So they're just typical politicians. I'm going to bring back jobs. I'm going to save your Second Amendment, which, by the way, is under siege from everybody. And we're bringing education local. We have to do that. We're going to bring education local because our education, the system is a total wreck.
We're going to strengthen our military, take care of our vets. We're going to go through a list of things and we're going to make this country so strong again, so great again, we have to strengthen our military. Our military is being absolutely depleted at the highest level. I mean, you look at -- I made a speech today and I was talking about the military compared to 10 years ago, it's incredible, it's just getting smaller, and yet the world is getting more and more dangerous.
But in terms of yourself, you look like you might be a businessman, we're going to lower taxes. I have the plan that lowers taxes more than any other person by far, more than any other candidate by far. Larry Kudlow is an amazing guy and economist, a friend of Greta's and everybody's, actually.
And he gave it his best review. But we're going to lower taxes. But we're going to bring jobs back. And the other thing is we're not going to let jobs go. If a Carrier came to me and said, we're going, we want to move to Mexico, I would say, that's OK, but you're going to pay a 35 percent tax every time an air conditioning unit is sold through that what will now be a strong border, and I will tell you something, they're going to say, sir, we're going to stay in Indiana.
So nobody can do more than that.
Good.
I think he's leaving the race today, by the way. So he has got some difficulty. But go ahead.
Sure.
That's really a good question. It's a question I get asked more than any other question, especially when I'm at, you know, where you have a lot of young folks going to college. And it's very sad. The students are -- literally they've borrowed up to here. And what the colleges have done is they haven't watched their costs, because basically the students are a conduit between the government and the college to get money.
And the college keeps going up, up, up, much faster than any other costs, if you take a look. And we're going to look into that seriously, because it's unfair. The students are borrowing up to here. The problem -- the other problem they have, and we're going to work on student loans, we're going to work on some kind of deal for low-interest and really good students loans, give them a longer term to pay it out, maybe you pay it out after they get jobs.
They have to pay it back. I mean, look, it's -- we work a deal where the students can live with it, because they're not being -- they're not able to live with it right now. But the biggest problem is you go to college, you go to a good college that's a good college, you go to a great college, and you graduate, and you do well, and you get out, and you can't get a job.
And that's the biggest problem, because they can't get jobs. There are no good jobs. You know, even the other side admits the jobs we have are bad jobs. And the real unemployment rate is like 20 percent, it's not 5 percent. That was done so the politicians look good. Because if you go out looking for a job and then you quit looking for a job, they consider you for -- you know, statistically you're considered employed.
So here's what we do. We're going to work on jobs. We're going to bring our jobs back from Mexico and from China and from Japan.
How? We're going to make our products here. We're going to start making our products here. Countries. So believe me, folks, countries are abusing us. And the reason the politicians don't do -- they know the problem, you know, corporate inversions and everything else. They're leaving like you wouldn't believe it. Look, I looked at numbers, 40 percent of your manufacturing is gone in this area, 40 percent over a fairly short period of time.
We're going to stop it. Companies are taking advantage of us. And countries are abusing us. And the way you stop is so easy. It's called consequence. If they want to play that game, and it's a dirty game that they're playing, again, free trading, I love it, I always want to defend it, but we can't do it because we don't have the people.
We don't have the smart people. What we're going to have to do is tariffs and taxes for the countries that don't behave. And you know what's going to happen? As soon as we say we're going to impose it, they're going to behave very, very nicely. The problem we have, and I'll tell you, it really is true, but the problem we have from the student standpoint, Greta, they're graduating from college.
They're wonderful. They're great. They graduate high in their class. They can't get jobs.
Hi, Steven.
Oh, I love it.
OK. It's a great question. And look, I want to see peace. I want to see if it can be done. You know, when you talk about the all-time deal in terms of toughness, that's it, a deal between the Palestinians and Israel. That's, to me, the all-time -- you know, we talk -- we all have our -- like it's called our dream deal.
What's the deal that you would most like?
I would love to be able to do it. Everyone tells me it can't be made. The Israeli tells me, you know, I've never met a person from Israel, and I know so many of them, that didn't want to make a deal. But they say that's the hardest deal, because it's years and years, it's centuries of -- it's like ingrained.
But I will be trying to make that deal. I am a big fan of Israel, I have to tell you. There's no bigger fan of Israel. But there is nobody that will be more loyal to Israel than Donald Trump. And we're going to make.
. And honestly, when you look at this horrible deal that Obama made -- that President Obama made with Iran where we give them $150 billion -- we got nothing out of the deal, $150 billion. We actually got nothing. Even our prisoners, they didn't come back until we gave them the money.
And I'll tell you what, you'll never see deals like that made with me. And you understand that, Steven, that's why you're with me. But we have to protect Israel. We have to take care of Israel. They're really sort of a bastion, all by themselves right now. And they have been great. I will say this, and I've said it and some people get upset with me on the Obama side when I say it, President Obama is the single worst thing that I have ever seen happen to Israel.
It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. We're going to protect and cherish Israel. But we're going to see if we can make a deal. I just have to do that. It's almost from a competitive standpoint now.
And they all say you can't do it, it can never be done. I say you can do it. Though we'll see what happens. So thank you, Steven.
Oh, thank you.
Well, I'll tell you, it was a funny story...
The whole country. I mean it's not the state. I mean it's everybody. But I get a call about a year ago from Bobby. He said, if you run for office, I'm endorsing you. And I haven't even really decided at that point whether I was going to run. But he just called up out of the blue. I said, you know what, Coach, do me a favor.
Give -- first, I had to make sure it was really him. I said, Bobby Knight. But I said, would you do me a favor, give me your number and, you know, let's see what happens and I'll call you back. And about a week ago, I said, hey, we're going to Indiana. And we all love Indiana, but who's more Mr. Indiana, who's done more for Indiana?
I mean look at all the championships that..... He's tough. He's smart. And he's just -- he knows how to win, because we don't win anymore, Bobby. We were saying before they don't win anymore.
And I said, hey, and I called the number. He picked up. Yes? I said, Coach, it's Trump. Do you still want to endorse me? He said, absolutely, I've been waiting for your call...
Thank you.
Well, it's a great -- that's actually a great question. I just love his philosophy. I mean we're in a different world and he was in the world of sports and nobody did better. And, you know, one of the great things about Bobby that a lot of people don't know is he really trained a lot of great coaches, some of the best, like you look at Duke and you look at so many of the different places where they have the great coaches, they were trained and they worked with Bobby.
But Bobby was, you know, in his field, a tremendous leader and what he's done is phenomenal. So I'd like to put myself in a category even close to Bobby as far as that. You talk about the word leadership, that's leadership. Thank you.
I can see both, to be honest with you. I mean we do help countries that we're not in love with them, but if we don't help them, it's going to be bigger problems. And I can sort of see both. At the same time, we give money and we give a lot of things and a lot of help to countries that absolutely don't deserve it, they absolutely -- they're not our friends, they don't do anything good for us. It's like a one way street.
You look at NATO as an example. We have 28 countries. We protect them. And many of those countries right now are delinquent. They haven't paid up and they have the money to pay up. And we have trillions, probably, trillions of dollars out there of past due. And I said I want these countries to pay up and we'll protect them and we'll take care.
I mean we're protecting them. They're not doing anything for us. They've got to pay up. And I said not only do they pay up, they have to pay us all of the past arrears.
Well, Pakistan is...
Yes, but the problem with Pakistan, where they have nuclear weapons and -- which is a real problem. Again, our -- the single biggest problem we have is nuclear weapons, you know, countries with them. And it's not only a country, you have nine countries right now with nuclear weapons. But it's semi-unstable.
And we don't want to see total instability. And it's not that much, relatively speaking. And we have a little bit of a good relationship. And I think I'd try and keep it. And it's very much against my grain to say that, but a country -- and that's always the country, I think, you know, we give them money and we help them out, but if we don't, I think that would go on the other side of the ledger and that could really be a disaster.
At the same time, if you look at India and some of the others, maybe they'll be helping us out, because we're going to look at it. But we have many, many countries that we give a lot of money to and we get absolutely nothing in return and that's going to stop fast.
Well, that's a problem. I mean you have to understand, though, Greta, we're a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. You know, we used to be the policeman -- we are now the policeman of the world. We take care of everything. Everybody says our military -- we spend many, many times what any other country spends on the military.
But we don't really spend it for ourselves, we spend it to protect everybody else. We're protecting everybody. It's not our military. Our military is -- as I said before, it's depleted. So you look at that. We have to start, you know, getting rid of debt, balancing budgets. We just can't continue to keep giving, giving, giving.
Now there are countries...
-- that can do it.
I'd...
-- I'd try j
I would try so hard to keep some of these countries going, but, Greta, we are a debtor nation. We are sitting on a bubble like you wouldn't believe. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to be at $21 trillion like almost immediately because of the horrible omnibus budget that was just passed, which, by the way, funds ObamaCare, it funds people pouring into the country, it forms people coming in from the Syrian migration and we have no idea who they are.
They could be ISIS. We have no idea who they are. So the answer is -- and I know how involved you are in that. And I'm not even that surprised to have this question, to be honest with you, because you are amazing. She goes all over the world helping people. And we're going to try but we do have problems.
We are a debtor nation. We do have problems. And we have to -- you know, I -- I gave a speech this morning and one of -- I mean the primary theme was America first. We have to fix our country. It's so broken. We have to fix it.
I am. I have great children. I have five children. And -- and the older ones are really helping me with the, uh, campaign. And Ivanka, Don and Eric and Tiffany, also. She's -- she's been terrific. And Baron is a little young right now, but he's -- he'll be there. He'll be there eventually. But, uh, they are fantastic children.
And there's nothing like -- you know, people oftentimes they say, you know, they're impressed by success. The most successful people that I've met, because the happiest, are the people with great families, mores than the people with money. I know them all. I know them all.
They'd better do it right or they...
Thank you.
It's tremendous.
Right.
That's not a bad idea.
The truth is...
-- she's doing -- yes, she's doing so well, I'm not sure she'd want it, if you want to know the.....
-- I will say this -- I will say this, it's such a great question and nobody ever asked that question. You know, we talk about how do you get money and bring the jobs back and all of that's going to be easy. In a way, the easiest thing for me is cutting, because we have wait -- we call it waste, fraud and abuse.
We have billions and billions and billions of dollars. And you see it, where a highway is going to cost X dollars and it costs five times more than it's supposed to. You can imagine the money that these contractors are making on these things that they're building all over the country where it's totally out of control, including military spending.
You know, military spending is -- is tremendous and very important to me. And we're going to rebuild our military. But things cost twice as much as they were supposed to cost, three times as much. It's not supposed to happen that way, OK. It won't happen that way with the right contractors, frankly, and the right people knowing how to negotiate a contract.
So there's tremendous waste and there's tremendous fraud and abuse. And we are going to save billions and billions of dollars. It's such a great question, because -- and it's so easy. It's so easy. That's one of the easiest things. So very good. I hope you're going to vote for me, by the way.
I think so. I really do. I think, uh, it's going to happen. And so many people have called me up over the last couple of weeks, because we've been doing so well. We had the big victory in New York, far beyond anybody's expectation. I mean we had -- it was a blowout. And then last night, as you know, it was a total blowout -- five -- five states that everybody -- every one of them was beyond expectation.
And I'll tell you what, I've been getting so many calls from people that I'll see on your show and other shows, that say the worst things about me. It's like...
No, no, no...
But, no, no, but they're... But -- but they'll say these things about me...
Oh, well.
That -- no, but Greta, they're saying -- they say such bad things and then they call me over the last couple of weeks, they want to get on board. They want to come in. They want to come into the cam -- I say -- I actually said to a couple of them, how can you -- after what you said about me, how can you -- it's OK, I -- I want to have you, but how can you possibly do that?
And they say don't worry about it. And you know why, because they're politicians. They can do it. You know, it doesn't matter. But they all want to come. So tremendous numbers of people are coming on board. They will be announced pretty soon. But a lot of people. And people that you wouldn't have believed, people that said the worst things.
And they're going to, you know, no problem.
It's a strange world here, Greta.

Tom Brake,"I beg to move,
That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision about the regulation of landlords and private rented accommodation; to extend tenants’ rights, particularly in relation to the sale of occupied rental property; to cap letting agents’ fees; to require the Mayor of London to establish a mandatory licensing scheme in respect of private landlords in Greater London; and for connected purposes.
It is no exaggeration to say that we have a national emergency in housing. It is unacceptable that in 2016 millions of people still suffer daily from poor housing, and live in fear and desperation without a secure, affordable place to call home. This fear is tearing communities apart and risks further dividing our country between a very well-off minority and the rest of us. We have soaring house prices, with the average cost of a two-bedroom house in London now out of the reach of more than 80% of people, and a rental sector in which too many people on low and middle incomes are spending around two-fifths of their salaries on housing—something confirmed by a report in the Evening Standard yesterday—and often suffer at the hands of rogue landlords. This problem is not going to go away soon.
Over the past decade, London’s private rented sector has more than doubled in size to become the second-largest housing tenure in the capital. There are now almost 1 million private rented sector properties in London, housing over 2 million people—about a third of the population. For many of those people, living in the private rented sector works well, with short-term tenancy agreements offering them the flexibility they need to move homes quickly for new jobs or career opportunities. Many of their private landlords are responsible, carrying out repairs in a timely manner and returning deposits promptly. However, for many others the sector has become a tenure of last resort, rather than a housing destination of choice.
There have been huge changes in the demographics of the private rented sector in recent years with an increasing number of families, low-income and vulnerable households living in the sector, but conditions remain poor: a third of homes fail to meet the Government’s decent homes standard, with over 60% of renters having experienced either damp, mould, leaking roofs or windows, electrical hazards, animal infestation or gas leaks, according to a recent survey commissioned by the housing charity Shelter.
Just last week at my surgery I met a woman who, soon after she started describing the conditions in her rented property, broke down in tears. She and her young son could no longer face waking up to live or dead rodents in their flat. In this case, her landlord is trying to help, but the quality of the housing stock makes it very difficult to stop rodents getting into the property. A few weeks previously, at another surgery, a young woman came to see me with her mother. Repairs are outstanding on their rented property. The landlord is refusing to sort them out while at the same time putting pressure on them to leave their flat. I am sure every MP will be all too familiar with these types of cases. This is why I am supporting the measures put forward by Caroline Pidgeon’s London Liberal Democrat team to overhaul the private rented sector. We believe the measures will benefit tenants and good landlords, and shut down the Rachmans of this world.
The exact number of rogue landlords operating in the sector remains unknown, but there is a growing sense that the problem is getting worse as demand for housing, and the profits that can be made from renting out any accommodation in whatever condition, continues to increase. One in 20 renters say they have rented from a rogue landlord in the past 12 months. As a survey of local authority enforcement in the private rented sector carried out in March 2016 by my Liberal Democrat colleagues on the Greater London Authority shows, the enforcement of standards in the private rented sector by local authorities is highly variable, with recent cuts to local authority budgets further diminishing the resources available to councils to tackle landlords who provide poor or unsafe living conditions. The resulting patchwork of enforcement has left thousands of Londoners at the mercy of rogue landlords.
Much of the problem lies with the lack of effective regulation and enforcement in the sector. The Residential Landlords Association, which represents small private landlords, would welcome tougher enforcement. Unfortunately, enforcement and inspection is very weak. One third of councils in London—10 boroughs—failed to prosecute a single landlord for providing unsafe accommodation in 2014-15. On average, London boroughs inspected one in every 55 homes in the private rented sector using the housing health and safety rating system. There is significant variation in the level of enforcement activity, with some councils inspecting one in 14 private rented properties for hazards and others about one in 500.
The private rented sector may have met the needs of tenants in years gone by, but the profile of renters, and the average length of tenancy, has changed dramatically in recent years. If some landlords are to lose their reputation as the property industry’s wild west cowboys, it is clear that a proper framework of regulation and enforcement is required. That is what is set out in the plans I am about to refer to, which would reform the private rented sector. My Bill seeks to implement them.
First, all landlords in London should be registered. This would make it easier to identify the scale of, and trends in, the private rented sector, and to ensure landlords can be traced easily.
Secondly, there should be a crackdown on rogue landlords through a licensing scheme. The Government should introduce a licensing scheme for all private landlords in London, with the aim of professionalising the sector, improving conditions and removing rogue landlords from the housing market. I accept that this proposal would not be welcomed by all landlords, but some accept a limited role, in certain circumstances, for licensing in some areas of London.
Thirdly, unfair letting agent fees for renters should be scrapped. Moving from one rented home to another can be very expensive, with high letting fees and large deposit requirements. I am told that agents try to poach landlords from each other to secure for themselves the fees that are triggered on a change of tenancy. Of course, they dangle the prospects of higher rents in front of the would-be landlord. In Sutton, a quick check suggests fees of around £400 to £500 when signing up a new tenant. When that is added to the six-week deposit—currently approximately £1,500 for a two-bedroom flat—a tenant would need to find a total of £2,000 upfront.
Fourthly, renters should be given extra rights when landlords sell up. There should be a requirement for tenants to be given first refusal to buy the home they are renting, should the landlord decide to sell it during a tenancy.
Finally, councils should be given the power to manage private rental property and offer longer tenancies. This would allow councils to develop, own and manage private sector rented homes, outside of housing revenue accounts, to improve the quality of homes in the sector, with the freedom to offer long-term tenancies. I call on the Government to work with private landlords, mortgage companies and freeholders to enable private landlords to offer longer tenancies. It is often the mortgage companies or the freeholders who are standing in the way of longer tenancies. This is a package that will make a real difference.
Neither I nor Caroline Pidgeon is claiming that these measures are the silver bullet that will solve London’s housing problems, because the fundamental challenge is a lack of supply, particularly of affordable homes, and that problem is no closer to a solution, given that fewer than 5,000 affordable homes were built in London last year, the lowest figure since the current Mayor was first elected in 2008. However, we believe that these proposals will improve the lot of private renters, some of whom suffer in poorly insulated, damp, mouldy properties with the threat of a retaliatory eviction hanging over the heads every time they ask for a repair. This has to stop. I urge the House to support this Bill.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, we're going to see what happens. We want to get our country back to work. The doctors, nurses, first responders -- everybody doing a phenomenal job, like beyond good. I'm going to -- as you know, the Comfort -- the great ship, Comfort -- is stocked up to the gills.
It's right up to the top. And we're going over there. I guess some of you are coming with me. But we're going to send that up to New York four weeks ahead of schedule. And it is loaded up with everything. So that's great. I just spoke with Governor Cuomo, and he's expecting it on Monday. It'll take about two days.
So we're very excited about that. But I'm going to go see the people that did the work, because it was supposed to take a good four weeks, and we did it in four days. So that's pretty good.
No, I think --
I think 3M has done an incredible job. I just spoke to Ken Langone. I think he's on the board of 3M. He called up and he said what a great job they've done. I think 3M, from everybody -- what everybody said, they've done an incredible job. Okay?
Oh, we're going to have plenty. Absolutely.
We're going to use -- I would say we'll use it again, maybe once or twice. We have a couple of little problem children, and we'll use it where we have to. But, overall, I tell you, the private free enterprise system is at work like nobody has seen in a long time. It's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing to watch.
Well, we're looking at two companies that have not lived up to what they said. I would say they're in a 1 percent group, okay? And now, all of a sudden, they heard we're going to use it, and they're rolling out the red carpet.
So, I think, really, most of the governors are very appreciative. As I said, I just spoke with Andrew Cuomo. I just spoke with Ron DeSantis. We're thinking about certain things. Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it's a hotspot -- New York, New Jersey. Maybe one or two other places; certain parts of Connecticut quarantined.
I'm thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it, but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine -- short-term, two weeks -- on New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut.
Restrict travel. Because they're having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don't want that. Heavily infected. We're having a really good dialogue with Governor Cuomo. We've supplied him with a lot of things. We're giving him an extra four medical centers, tents. That's beyond what we've already given.
As you know, we're giving them to New Jersey. We're doing a great job with the Governor of New Jersey. He's been very good.
Well, this would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I'd rather not do it, but we may need it. So I will see you over at the ship.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you both. Thank you very much. This is some group, some group. It's nice to win, isn't it? Isn't it nice to win? Robert, thank you very much for that incredible introduction, and thank you to everyone from First Baptist Dallas. Thank You. Pastor, you and Amy have stood with us since the very very beginning, and I will always stand with you. I've told you that, and I mean that I will always be with you. I appreciate it, thank you.
And I'm honored to join you at the first ever Fourth of July Freedom Rally, taking place here at the Kennedy Center, as we pay tribute to those who have proudly served our nation in uniform. Thank you very much.
Tonight, we have been inspired by music that fills our heart, stirs our souls, and reminds us all of who we are: one nation, under God. I just want to say that your music honors our heroes more eloquently than words could ever do, and I just want to thank you.
That's real talent standing behind me, thank you folks.
And I promise you -- then you see it happening day by day -- just the other day, we signed veterans accountability, they've been trying to do it for 40 years. You couldn't fire somebody, if they were horrible, doing a terrible job for the veterans -- robbing, stealing, hurting people, you couldn't do anything. It's called the Veterans Accountability Act, and now you can say, you're fired.
Thank you, and I promise you that we will always take care of our great veterans, always. Right, Louie? You better believe it. And Paula's up there. Paula White has been so helpful.
You've shed your blood, you've poured your love, and you've bared your soul in defense of our country, our people, and our great American flag. Your loyalty to our nation is measured not merely in words but in deeds. You race through gunfire, stare down enemy forces and ran past the gates of hell to fight and to win for America, and you won for America, and we're going to take care of it.
The story of America's men and women in uniform is the story of freedom, and overcoming oppression. The strong protecting the weak, and the good defeating evil. There's a lot of evil out there. I want to tell you there's a lot of evil. I was left a mess, the fact is, but we're cleaning it up. You watch. Cleaning it up. Cleaning it up.
We are awed by your service and your sacrifice, and so to the veterans here tonight, of which there are many, will you please stand, right now? Please stand, thank you. Thank you very much. We will always, always remember what you did for us. Tonight, we celebrate veterans. We also reflect on everything we cherish as Americans. We love our country. We love our families. We love our freedom, and we love our God.
Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence 241 years ago, America always affirmed that Liberty comes from our Creator, our rights are given to us by God and no earthly force can ever take those rights away. To the people.
The fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them, because the people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm President and they're not. The fact is the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they use the hatchet and the people saw it right from the beginning.
The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives. On behalf of our great American people, will never happen. Their agenda is not your agenda. You've been saying it. I will never stop fighting for you. I am delivering on trade, on the economy, on the Supreme Court, on the Second Amendment, on our military. For our veterans and on our borders, where we are doing record, record stoppage.
Thank you, and we are supporting our incredible police and law enforcement.
For too long, politicians have tried... all have they tried, to centralize authority among the hands of a small few in our nation's capital. I see them all the time. Bureaucrats think they can run over your lives, overrule your values, meddle in your faith and tell you how to live, what to say and where to pray. But we know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise their children and create a thriving Society.
And we know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create a strong and loving community. And above all else, we know this: in America, we don't worship government. We worship God. The American founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer.
I remind you that we're going to start saying Merry Christmas again. Inscribed on our currency are the words In God We Trust. But not only has God bestowed on us the gift of freedom, he's also given us the gift of heroes willing to give their lives to defend that freedom. You just stood in every struggle against evil throughout our history, as America's service members have huddled around campfire,  and sought refuge in foxholes.
They've called on their Creator for support in World War II when General George Patton -- that was a real general, we got some Pattons today too, I found them. Mad Dog Mattis. They're going fast.
But when Patton ran into a problem that he couldn't solve, he knew what to do. He prayed. Frustrated by rains that were stalling the advance of his Third Army across Europe in early December 1944, horrible weather, Patton asked an Army chaplain to come up with a good prayer for the weather.
Patton then had a quarter of a million copies of that prayer printed and distributed to the soldiers of the Third Army, just before the Battle of the Bulge. That was a big one, did very well there. Five hundred thousand American soldiers fought that pivotal battle of the Second World War. One of those soldiers is here with us tonight. His name is Harry F Miller, where's Harry? Where's Harry? Harry, stand up Harry.
Like many of the heroes of his generation, Harry wasn't exactly straightforward about his age when he enlisted in the Army Reserves. Shame on you. Harry, he was just 15 but he told them he was old enough to join. Then he immediately asked for a transfer to active duty six months after he had enlisted. Private Miller was on his way to Europe to fight for our country.
A couple of months after that, he was in the freezing cold. How cold? Cold, he said. Really cold and driving rain of Belgium with the 740th Tank Battalion attached to the 82nd airborne, as the Battle of the Bulge began. Harry got his orders to go find tanks at a weapon storage facility. When he arrived, he says he and his friends found nothing but tanks they were all over the place, right? Nothing but tanks.
But they didn't let the tanks stop them. Out of what spare parts they could find, and through sheer grit and resolve, they somehow managed to repair three of those tanks and get them all set for action and ready to fight.
And before long ,those three tanks were nose-to-nose with the lead elements of a German SS Panzer Division, and that was tough stuff. In a short time, those tanks had knocked out the first three tanks of the enemy, and the entire German division retreated. They left. That's good, Harry. A lot of guts.
Tomorrow, Harry will be 89. Tomorrow. So on behalf of this very large group, in this beautiful building, Senior Master Sergeant Miller, Happy Birthday. Thank you for your lifetime of service, and thank you for helping out. Thank you very much.
Since my very first day in office, we've taken one action after another to make sure that our veterans get the care they so richly deserve. We've published wait times -- those wait times were bad, weren't they? But boy, are they getting better and fast. And we've published them at every VA facility, delivered same day mental health services at every VA Medical Center, nearly doubled.
The number of veterans given approvals to see the doctor of their choice, and as I said, just signed, brand-new legislation went through the House, went through the Senate and I signed it so fast. We didn't want to take any chances, right Harry? To ensure every VA worker is held accountable for the quality of care they provide to our veterans.
Tonight, we are deeply honored to be joined by a number of wounded warriors from Walter Reed. I was over there recently. These are incredible people, the enthusiasm and the spirit and some of them were hurt really badly. They've got so much spirit and they love this country so much. These American heroes risked everything so that you and I can live in freedom. They gave all. They had everything for their comrades, their country and for victory.
They liked winning. We like winning again, don't we. We sort of just keep fighting and fighting and fighting. Gonna win again, folks. We applaud their strength, their courage and we really support that incredible wind that they have. The will, the will is so strong and that's what they want to do, is they want to win, and they want to win for you. So thank you all very much for being here, that was great.
One such hero is Captain Luis Avila, where is he Luis? Luis... Wow. Thank You Claudia. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Thank you. Luis served in the Army for 16 years. He held many different positions on five combat tours, and he was always a leader, and everybody always said. I did some checking on you Luis, that you did a great job no matter where you were. No matter where you went.
On his fifth deployment, Luis bravely led his company on a successful mission to recover vital intelligence. During this critical mission, his vehicle was struck by explosives. Luis was gravely wounded, and lost his leg. He received a Purple Heart for service and sacrifice. To Luis and Claudia, we will never forget the courageous sacrifice that you made for all of us in this room tonight, and for everyone in our country. Thank you. Thank you.
I want you all, and all of our incredible wounded warriors, to know you have an entire nation of more than 300 million people behind you, and our nation's getting strong again. You notice getting strong again. Our hearts and our prayers are joined with yours. Your legacy, like our gratitude, will live forever, and I want to thank you.
Thank you very much, and Claudia thank you very much. Thank you. I also want to speak to all of the people -- see you thought I forgot -- in our faith community, who are here with us tonight. Veterans and non-veterans alike, you're never gonna be forgotten. You'll never be forgotten. My administration will always support and defend your religious liberty. We want to see prayers before football games, if they want to give prayers.
We want all children to have the opportunity to know the blessings of God. We will not allow the government to censor sermons, to restrict the free speech of our pastors and our preachers, and the people that we most respect, like Robert. That is why... just as I promised Pastor Jeffress and other faith leaders... I just signed an executive order following, and this is something that makes me very happy and very proud, following through on my campaign pledge to stop the Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment rights.
As long as I am President, no one is going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what is in your heart. We want to hear him. One of the most grave and dire threats to religious freedom in the world today is the threat of terrorism, and specifically, it just seems, it's called radical Islamic terrorism, and we cannot allow this terrorism and extremism to spread in our country or to find sanctuary on our shores or in our cities.
We want to make sure that anyone who seeks to join our country shares our values and has the capacity to love our people. Together, we will protect our families, our nations and our borders and yes, by the way for those that are curious, we will build the wall, okay? Because we understand that a country is more than just its geography. A nation is the sum of its citizens, their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations.
America is a land rich with history traditions and values, and as we have seen tonight, what a group this is tonight. America is also a land rich with heroes. Every single day, and whether we are black or brown or white, and you've heard me say this before, we all bleed the same red blood. We all salute the same great American flag, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
We face many challenges. There are many hills and mountains to climb, but with the strength and courage of the Patriots assembled in this room tonight, we will scale -- I mean, and you say it, and you see it all the time, and we're doing it all the time, because we're scaling those summits, and we will get the job done. We will all prove worthy of this very important moment in history, and we will prove worthy of the sacrifice that our brave veterans have made. As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, we will not fail.
As long as our country remains true to its values, loyal to its heroesm and devoted to its creator, then our best days are yet to come. Because we will make America great again. To my friend Pastor Jeffress, and to Paula and to Louie  and to Harry and to Luis, and everybody in this room, and everybody in this country, thank you for your great support. I appreciate it.
I will not let you down -- all of our incredible veterans -- the people in the military and -- evangelical Christians who came out in record, record, record numbers. Thank you. Have a wonderful Independence Day. God bless you. God bless our nation's veterans. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
"
Ron DeSantis,"… this posture of fighting the coronavirus, obviously that impacted our economy in significant ways. One of the ways you saw that was a significant reduction in traffic on our roads You saw it in Central Florida, you saw it in other parts of the state. I viewed that as an opportunity for the state of Florida to get ahead on some of our transportation and infrastructure projects, and so in April, I directed the Florida Department of Transportation to utilize this opportunity with less traffic on the roads and accelerate numerous projects, including the very important I-4 Ultimate Project.
I wanted to ensure that we maximize construction efforts to support Florida’s economy and ensure that Florida was able to reopen stronger than before. Many States throughout the country, they stopped all construction. They stopped manufacturing as well. I think that was a big mistake. We did not do that in Florida. We kept construction going. We knew you could do it safely. This is an example of taking advantage of that by using construction.
FDOT worked very hard. They understood that they had a window here to really make a difference, and so just last week FDOT announced that it’s accelerated more than 40 projects across the state, which will eliminate more than 650 total contract days. Today, I’m pleased to announce the completion of the I-4 and state road 408 interchange; five new flyover ramps that together composed the most impactful portion of the I-4 Ultimate Project. Today’s ramp openings come more than three months ahead of schedule; and not only that, but even when I accelerated it, today’s opening is six weeks sooner than even we anticipated in April. I think that that’s a testament to what FDOT has been able to do. Now this 408 exchange is the busiest portion of the I-4 Ultimate Project. These improvements will increase safety, ease the movement of commerce and, most importantly, enhance Central Floridians commutes as we transition back to a fully-functioning economy.
Beyond the 408 interchange, FDOT was also able to move a large portion of westbound general use lanes into their final configuration. Since April, just over a month ago, FDOT has utilized lane closures on I-4 and various ramp closures to accelerate work on the westbound general use lanes. Work completed includes permanent drainage installation, roadway widening, new ramp construction and the placement of bridge girders in the following areas: I-4 between SR436 to North SR434, I-4 between Kennedy Boulevard and just west of Lee Road, and I-4 between Fairbanks Avenue and Princeton Street, as well as I-4 between SR50 Colonial Drive and South Street.
We announced five locations of acceleration that we could guarantee when we made the announcement in April. FDOT’s actually been working at over 12 locations with extended lane and ramp closures. This work has shorten construction by between one and two months in key areas.
Now, the accelerated construction is important. It’s expected to generate 14.5 million in benefits to Central Floridians and to the state in general. This is a result of reduced delays, improved travel time and reduced reduce traffic crashes from the improved corridor, all of which have economic benefits to the region and to the state. Accelerating the 408 interchange construction has also helped sustain more than 1500 jobs directly associated with the I-4 Ultimate Project. This is a testament to FDOT’s commitment and the hard work and determination of the construction industry in our state.
Now, upon completion of the I-4 Ultimate Project, 15 interchanges will be rebuilt. As of now, the major interchanges at Kirkman Road and Maitland Boulevard have already been placed and have their final configuration and a whole new overpass at Grand National Drive has opened, connecting area attractions, hotels, restaurants, and commercial establishments. This is in addition to 13 miles of reconfigured general use lanes in the eastbound direction that have been opened to traffic already improving daily commutes. Now some construction continues, but travel times have improved.
We have in Central Florida, 2.5 million residents in the greater Orlando area. It’s grown by more than 20%, just in the last 10 years, one of the top-10 fastest growing regions in the country. It’s, of course, the top tourist destination in the world. It’s vital to Florida’s economy because of our venues, our attractions and our resorts. Transportation is going to be important as Central Floridians get back to work.
When Walt Disney chose the location to build the Magic Kingdom, he did so to its close proximity to I-4 turnpike interchange, so having the right infrastructure really does create a foundation for future growth. Obviously we’ve seen that with the theme parks.
Through I-4 Ultimate 21 miles of interstate are being completely transformed with 2.4 billion investment in Central Florida’s future. This is no simple feat. This is heavy and complex construction, and I’m very much proud of FDOT’s work and appreciate the patience of so many people throughout Central Florida. This was a very trying time, a lot of uncertainty. When I called Kevin in, I said, “We’ve got to take advantage of this.” He said, “All right, let me make a plan.” Came back with a plan and not only here, but you see other major projects throughout the state, in the Tampa/St. Pete area, Miami, these are things that are being moved ahead of schedule, and that’s going to benefit folks on their daily commute.
This FDOT project is done just in time as today, we move into what I’m calling “The full Phase One of Florida’s safe, smart, step-by-step plan for recovery.” When we announced the initial plan in April, we said we wanted to make sure that we were proceeding very methodically, driven by data and making sure that things were going to be able to go as smoothly as possible. We deliberately did not exhaust all the options that were outlined in Phase One of the White House’s guidance.
Last week, I announced that starting today, we would move forward with more of that Phase One in place in Florida. Our restaurants have been operating with outdoor seating with the social distance, and then 25% of indoor capacity. Today, they will now be able to continue with the outdoor seating, but then go up to 50% indoor capacity, of course, with the proper distancing precautions. Retail establishments increased as well for their indoor capacity. Gyms and fitness centers, now they’re subjected to strict sanitation protocols, but those are allowed to be reopened today in the state of Florida. I think that that’s going to be a relief for a lot of people that have wanted to get back in the gym, so we’re glad that that’s going on.
I’ve made it very clear to a bunch of leagues and individual athletes and individual competition, Florida can be a venue. Obviously, we have our own teams. Those leagues are going to start, hopefully getting up and running again in the not too distant future. Any of those leagues that have teams in states that won’t allow that competition, we can find places here in Florida. I mean, you look at Orlando, there’s a football stadium right here that could host games. We believe that getting sports back online is important for kind of the nation’s mojo. We want to make sure that we’re doing our part here in Florida to be able to do it.
We also, in our announcement for this full Phase One, have told our theme parks, submit plans for reopening, show us how you’re going to keep staff and people safe and then have the endorsement of the relevant local official or officials in your area. We’re happy to consider that as we go forward. When you open a theme park, it’s not like you can just flip a switch and three days later do it. No, they’re going to need a lot of runway to be able to know a date certain. I’m not saying this is going to happen tomorrow, but I think it is prudent to solicit these plans so that we know the direction that we’re going. But I think you’ve already seen some theme parks in other parts of the world open, and I know we are going to get that done here. It’s just a matter of at what time and what the schedule looks like. We also are telling the counties that these vacation rentals, if they have a plan and they want to submit, then we’re happy to look at that as well.
What we’re looking at in terms of Phase One, if you look, those original Phase One counties, the data has been very, very strong throughout this period. If you look, today’s data, that’s going to be published today, statewide there was out of 24,000 tests about 700 new cases. That’s a 3.27% positivity rate statewide. But if you look at those original Phase One counties outside of the Miami and Fort Lauderdale area, that’s about a 2.4% positivity rate. That’s very, very low. That’s exactly what you want to see.
The reports from yesterday, there were almost 30,000 test results that came in, almost 1,200 new cases. That was a 4.23% positivity, which is very low. But then as we looked in the numbers, we saw Miami had 500 cases reported. Miami at their peak had had 500, but more recently had been about 150. When they would go above that it was usually because of the Homestead Prison. We thought maybe that that was because of the prison outbreak. It turns out of the 500 cases reported yesterday from Miami, 400 of them were backlog cases from three weeks ago, from April 24th. There was this test center not affiliated with the state who had been running tests and they just now reported it. I think Miami’s trend has been good. Most of those cases, in fact, 80% of them were from three weeks ago that just now got reported. It’s important as you see this to look behind the numbers and identify.
I think what we’ve seen is when you see numbers in any county kind of go out of what they’ve been trending., it’s usually a data dump with backlog tests, a prison outbreak, nursing home, or sometimes we’ll have new test sites that pop up and that you see a surge and then it dies down. We’re monitoring that. We’re continuing to do an awful lot with the longterm-care facilities. I really view that as the tip of the sphere going forward. I view it as a discrete problem. I don’t think it means that you can’t do things in society, but it does mean that we need to understand that those areas are still where the most vulnerable are at. We need to continue to keep our eye on the ball there, and we will do that.
I want to let Secretary Thibault come up and say a few words, and then I’ll have a few more things and be able to answer any questions.
Well, we’re really thrilled about this. I think to be able to expedite and not only from what we had scheduled, but even once we said we wanted to expedite, having done it quicker than that is really, really good. I think it just shows FDOT being able to really get the job done. We’re going to continue with that. Really, I’m just looking forward to helping bring us back. Obviously, we still have issues with public health, that’s not going to go away. But I think we have a pathway to get Florida moving again. It is smart. It’s safe. It is step by step. It’s not just turning a switch. But I really believe that Central Florida can be a major driver in that, and having great infrastructure projects are part of it. Obviously, there’s going to be a lot more that hopefully will happen over the next days, weeks and months here.
With that, happy to take some questions. Yes, sir?
I just couldn’t hear you? Yeah, take it off. Yeah.
Yeah.
The question was about one of the healthcare systems reported that they had thousands of tests that they had sent to a lab, and basically I think the lab, they just got stuck in a warehouse. Now these tests have to be, like the samples have to be refrigerated, properly cared for. This is not just like sending a piece of paper. Apparently what happened was they figured out that this lab, I think it was in Texas, just let the samples be spoiled. They had thousands of samples. That was not from any of Florida’s test sites. We haven’t necessarily seen that happen with any of ours, but I’m glad that they said that that’s the case.
Now, I think those tests were long enough ago that we would know any clinical significance of these test results by now. Part of the thing, I think that we’ve seen with this coronavirus is, and this is I think a fortunate thing, for the vast bulk of the population, particularly those under 50, our working-age population that don’t have significant health conditions, the clinical significance of this has been low. The hospitalization rate has been low. The fatality rate, fortunately, has been low. Florida, I think it shows that with this statistics. I don’t think that you have seen a lot of necessarily out of the ordinary clinical significance, but it does go to show we’re looking at expanding lab capacity even more than we already have. We’re going to be having high throughput labs at all of our state labs. But that company was actually one that Florida looked to potentially do business with. We never sent them any tests, but obviously after that, we’re not going to be doing business with them.
Yes, sir?
Did you vet any of them?
Did you vet though? Do you know? Did they submit a valid social security number?
I’m not dismissing, but here’s the facts.
Right now. Excuse me, excuse me. When you say I have somebody, the question is: Has that person completed the application?
For example, we were in Tampa the other day and one of the reporters said, “I have someone here who hasn’t been able, filed in mid-March,” or whatever. I was like, “Give us the name.” We took the name and went and it turns out the employer’s contesting it, saying that the individual quit. All these have individual fact-specific stuff.
Here’s what I can tell you, more than two-billion has now been paid out and of all the unique, complete and eligible applicants, 97% have now been paid. Unique applicant, valid application, eligible, 97% have been paid.
What we’re going to do tomorrow is I’m going to take all the data, because we’re going to have even more good news from what was done yesterday, and we’re going to put that out and we’re going to show not only who’s all been paid, and then we’re going to go over the common pitfalls for people that have not been paid.
But I think it’s your responsibility, if you’re representing that there’s someone in March who hasn’t been paid to tell your viewers whether that someone is a valid applicant or not. If someone applies and doesn’t support a social security number, guess what, federal, you can’t pay under those circumstances.
Right. No, no, no. Here’s the problem, you are not even investigating whether they’re valid claims. You’re just asserting that people have applied. I’m telling you that we have two-billion dollars in claims that have been paid. We have 97% of the unique, eligible, completed applications. The issue is they’re paid in the order they’re received. If you apply today, you’re not going to leapfrog someone that paid. They’re paid in the order that we receive. Those are just the facts. I know it’s like, to take an anecdote here, but I’m telling you, you got a responsibility. If you’re going to put that out to viewers to say that we’ve looked into it. The person submitted social security. The person is eligible. And not just say that, “Oh, someone said,” because you know what? Under normal circumstances, you have people who aren’t. I mean, we’re getting people from other countries applying. We’re getting people from other states applying. And so that all goes through the process.
Have Kevin do it. Yeah.
South Florida, as you know, when we did Phase One, we viewed South Florida a little differently. They’re on a different schedule. They submitted to me last week plans for their kind of Phase One. Their plans did not include the gyms. They’re allowed to do it if they want, but I approved their plans as is. If they decide they want to do the gyms, they can do it, but we’ve worked with them throughout and really been collaborative.
My view on all this is, look, you have to work together, local, state, federal. If we’re at loggerheads, it’s not going to work. Throughout the whole process, whether it’s Miami, Broward, Palm Beach, there were times when we were doing things together and if I were in their shoes, I may not have done 100%. But I think it’s better to just, let’s get on the same page and let’s go forward. That’s what we’ve tried to do. They didn’t want to do that yet, and so I gave them the freedom to be able to make those determinations. But I think you’re going to see them do that pretty quickly going forward. I think also because these gyms, I mean, they’re ready for sanitation. They understand the things that need to be done. I think that they’re really in a situation where their members want to get back in. It’s not like just the public crowds. I mean, these are people that actually pay to be members at these places. Hopefully that’ll come online soon. But I do think their epidemic was different.
You may have seen some, there’ve been things that have come out recently about where did New Yorkers flee when the epidemic hit, and the number one state that they fled to, right here in the state of Florida. I quarantined them in March. Everyone, New York media, was blowing a gasket. “How could you do this?” That was the right decision. That was the number one landing pad. South Florida got inundated. Had we not done the quarantine, you would’ve had way more cases, hospitalizations, the whole nine yards. I have no doubt that that quarantine saved lives. I think it dissuaded some from coming down. But I think the ones that did, we were able to process and screen and I think it was effective. But South Florida has had to deal with some certain problems and I think they’ve done a really good job under the circumstances. Their schedule is a little bit different than the other 64 counties.
Well, so what I said from the beginning is I’m not a doctor. I’ve had physicians say they’ve had positive clinical results. I think a lot of it is if you give it to someone that’s critically ill, it’s certainly isn’t going to help. It’s too late. If you do it early, they think it could help. I said, “Okay, if you guys think it could help.” I went, I talked to the president, we got supplies from India. I got some other, pushed it out. If they want to use it, they can use it. If they don’t, they don’t. But it wasn’t anything that we ever endorsed per se. But I actually still think you have physicians in Florida who are using it. I think you do have some that think it’s had some benefit, but it seems like it’s only beneficial if you get it early enough in the onset of disease. Once somebody is really critically ill and on a ventilator, it’s not clear that that’s the case.
Now we’ve also put out this, the new drug that just came out from FDA. What’s the name of it? I forget. There’s so many of these things. But that came out, and that has mixed reviews too. We got a shipment, we’re putting it out. Hospitals can request for people that are on ventilators or in the intensive care unit, and they can use it as they see fit. I think, Oh, remdesivir. Remdesivir has mixed reviews. Some doctors think it’d be helpful. Some don’t. It’s really ultimately up to the doctor and the patient to make those decisions. If I have remdesivir available, I want to give the doctors the option for that just as we would do with the hydroxychloroquine.
All right, well, this is exciting. Hopefully everyone will save some time on the roads and we’ll see you guys soon.
By the way-
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, everybody.
And I want to thank the great Dan Gable and Kathy, his beautiful wife -- they're here someplace -- for their support; greatest wrestler, maybe ever. Pretty good. And I'll tell you what; he loves Iowa and so do I. So, thank you, Dan. You're out here -- where is Dan? Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Kathy.
I love you too. I love you too.
I love you too.
'-- is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton.
And be delivered.
In her very brief remarks tonight, Hillary Clinton tried to politicize this investigation by attacking and falsely accusing the FBI Director of only sending the letter to Republicans -- another Clinton lie. As it turned out, the letter was sent to both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. The FBI would never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal offense.
As you know, I've had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail.
Prior to today's events, I was going to start off this speech by talking about how great we've been doing the polls.
We've been running an issue-based campaign, focused on change, accountability, and, of course, repealing and replacing Obamacare.
We're campaigning all over the country with a plan to bring back our jobs and provide safety for our families.
'-- going three points ahead in North Carolina.
We're up, according to Bloomberg, at least two points in Florida.
And, by the way, the people standing on lines in Florida, and so many other places, are unbelievable -- early voting states. And a lot of them have red hats; they have white hats; they have pins; they have shirts that happen to say Make America Great Again.
And, for the most part, these are people that are voting for Trump; right? For the most part.
Where they have the whole deal and plenty of buttons, we've got their vote. But the lines have been incredible all over the country. We've pulled --
Thank you. We've pulled ahead nationally in numerous polls, and this was all before this recent disaster for her, but justice for the country, occurred.
We had gaps, but we are really moving. And I just wanted to say that, because I don't know what's going to happen now.
'-- has us up four points in Iowa.
In 11 days, we are going to win the state of Iowa and we are going to win back the White House.
Early voting is underway, so make sure you get out and vote. It's a movement like nobody has ever seen before in this country. You must get out and vote. We're going to take back the White House; we're going to bring common sense to government; we're going to bring honesty to government. Get out and vote. Thank you.
So much is at stake in this election. When we win in November, we are going to have honest government once again. Hillary Clinton destroyed 33,000 emails; destroyed 13 iPhones; two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing -- maybe know they'll be able to find it. She put her office up for sale to large corporations, donors and foreign powers. Those same special interests are now spending millions on her campaign in an effort to keep their corrupt grip on power. And I have to tell you, I was in Florida a couple of days ago, and they say it's 50-to-1 ads -- 50-to-1. Now, isn't it beautiful? Fifty-to-one -- all of that Wall Street money going to help crooked Hillary, and we're leading. How are you leading when it's 50-to-1.
And boy am I spending a lot of my money and -- wow. Dan Gable would say, You shouldn't be spending that much
And we're going to return power to the people.
You know, I was on the other side and I understand the other side probably as well as anybody. But I love our country. I really love our country. And I saw what was happening and I had to do this. And on June 16th of last year, when I announced, coming down the escalator with Melania, I announced -- I want to tell you, it was one of the great honors of my life, because we are going to start winning again; our country is going to start being smart again; we're not going to let our jobs disappear; we're going to be the smart country once again -- the smart country.
We have, as a movement -- like they've never seen before -- a once in a lifetime chance to clean up Washington, to bring fairness and growth back to our economy, and to stop wasting trillions and trillions of dollars in misguided wars and adventures overseas -- and we never win. We never win. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare.
It's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive, double-digit hike -- double-digit -- these hikes. And, by the way, they were announced by the White House and they said 25 percent, which is terrible. But the real number is double that. The real number is much more than that. As an example, the great state of Arizona will have a 116 percent increase in premiums.
Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world""
Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare -- remember? Remember that name from a year and a half ago? Remember that name? People forget; but, I don't forget -- admitted it was all a fraud. He said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Do you remember that guy.
But the only stupidity was that the officials who rammed this through, over the objections of the America voter -- this is what happened -- did a tremendous disservice to our country. Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. And I've been saying it for a long time. But, you know what? What happened today, starting with the FBI -- maybe the system will become a little less rigged. Beautiful.
Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. She also wants to put illegal immigrants on Obamacare, further collapsing our healthcare system in this country.
Repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the single-most important reasons we must win on November 8th.
By the way, who has voted, so far? Raise your hands.
That's not great. Who is going to vote.
All right; good. That's good. We're going to do great. Special place; special people; special place. Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to take our government back from the donors and the special interests. I used to be a donor. I used to be a special interest. Now I'm very much an outsider. I may be the all- time -- I might -- I might just be the all-time outsider -- the day I announced. One day I was an insider and then, boom, oh boy was I an outsider. But I knew what had to be done. I want the entire, corrupt Washington establishment to hear us, immediately, when we say -- when we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. Drain the swamp.
We're going to drain the swamp.
By the way, they just told me this is a record-setting crowd for this place. Not bad. Not bad.
And I don't have a guitar; I don't have an instrument, so that makes it even better.
At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Right now, 70 million American women and children live in abject poverty -- or, something -- I mean, what's happening in this country. This is the United States of America. Think of that number. Forty- five percent of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty. Another two million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty under the Obama administration. Forty thousand American veterans are homeless -- our great people. These are our great people, yet our government spends hundreds of billions providing benefits for people that are in our country illegally.
We are going to turn it around and that begins with a plan to lower taxes on American businesses from 35 percent, which is the highest anywhere in the world, to 15 percent, which is among the lowest.
And that includes massive tax cuts for family farms. Do you like that? Family farms.
You have some great farms, I will -- we're going to protect our family farmers. Hillary Clinton's plan will shut down family farms all over the nation. She will do this, not only through radical EPA regulation -- and you know what's happening. The farmers are telling me all the time -- EPA is destroying them. But, also, by raising taxes on family farms and all businesses to rates as high as 45 and 50 percent. Adding to the pain, Hillary wants to substantially increase the Estate Tax on family farms. In other words, it will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs.
I'm eliminating the death tax.
On top of that, her anti-energy agenda will radically drive up the cost of energy; another attack on agriculture. I will end this war on the American farmer. The American farmers are incredible people. These are incredible people and we will end that war.
We will also reverse the EPA intrusion and eliminate the anti- farmer regulations, of which there are so many, that it makes it very hard for you to compete with the farms of other countries. We will protect corn-based ethanol, importantly.
And we will also cancel billions of dollars in climate change payments to the United Nations, and we will use that money to help rebuild America's infrastructure.
It's going to be America first. We will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Hillary wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country.
And that's over the thousands and thousands and thousands of people coming from Syria. We don't know who they are, where they're from. They're coming from Syria under President Obama. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent. The Hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism inside of our shores. So let me state this as clearly as I can: When I'm elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of this country.
A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And, yes, we will build the wall. And, yes, Mexico will pay for the wall.
Hundred percent. Hundred percent. We have a massive trade deficit with Mexico. Great, wonderful people. I met with the leader three months ago -- President of Mexico -- very good meeting. But we have a massive trade deficit with Mexico. Numbers are staggering. The cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what we're talking about. They will pay for the wall in form or the other. They may not know that yet, but that's okay.
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root, who was right from this area -- an incredible young woman, and I've spent time with her amazing family. The illegal immigrant who killed Sarah arrived at the border, enter federal custody, and then was released into the United States community under the policies of our very weak and very sad White House. He was released again after he killed Sarah, and is now at-large. Sarah graduated from college with a 4.0 index -- top in her class -- the day before she was killed. Her parents are great people. I've gotten to know them; they are great people -- just great people -- devastated -- always devastated -- will always be devastated.
Hillary has pledged open borders and supports sanctuary cities.
Under my contract with the American voter, we are going to cancel all funding for sanctuary cities immediately. We also need a new foreign policy that puts American first. Hillary's policies have caused disasters in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and unleashed ISIS with the great vacuum -- created the vacuum. And now she stands up and says I will get rid of ISIS"". We didn't have ISIS until she came in. They created -- look
In fact, the real question is, who's more dishonest? Crooked Hillary Clinton or the media? I don't know. It's a close -- honestly, these are among the most dishonest people in the world, believe me. Our corrupt political class has enriched themselves, but left our families with poverty, unemployment and rising crime. Now, Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia, which could very well lead to World War III. This is over Syria, folks.
To all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership.
Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. We're going to eliminate unnecessary, job- killing regulations. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order.
We're going to provide -- you're going to like this -- school choice and put an end to common core, which is a disaster. We'll bring our education local.
We will rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans, who have not been properly taken care of.
We have tremendous veteran and military support in this campaign. We're going to reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement.
And, by the way -- you won't hear this from the media -- we have the highest murder rate in this country in 45 years. You don't hear that from these people. They don't want to talk about it. The highest murder rate in the United States in 45 years. We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is totally under siege.
And the NRA, which are great people -- National Rifle Association -- gave me the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody.
They're great people.
And we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
Americans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade or many decades away. Hillary has been there for 30 years and she's accomplished nothing but negative results. She's made things worse. She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future -- we, all together.
Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of republicans, democrats, independents and first-time voters. We're going to have a lot of them. We're going to have a lot of first-time voters.
Got a lot of great people. Forty-five years; 50-years-old; 67. I'll tell you, I met a first-time voter in Tennessee -- 92-years-old. The most beautiful woman -- 92-years-old; first-time voter. Most incredible person. We have so many. And these are great Americans, they've just never found anybody they really wanted to vote for. Now they have.
We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people; not the donors, and not the special interests.
We're a divided nation, but we are fighting to bring us all together as Americans, like we're -- tonight -- there's love. There's love here. With your vote, we are just 11 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.
We will make American wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.
God bless you. God bless you, Iowa. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Get out and vote. Thank you, Iowa.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. It is a great honor to have been invited, and if I can lend a hand, I would certainly love to do so.
I have to start by saying I am a big fan, a very big fan of the United Nations and all it stands for. I cannot speak as to what has been happening over the last number of years because it certainly has not been good, but the concept of the United Nations and the fact that the United Nations is in New York is very important to me and very important to the world as far as I am concerned. So I am a big fan, such a fan in fact that at great expense I built a building across the street. It is the tallest apartment house in the world. It has been a tremendously successful building, sold out, and I am very proud of it. And if the United Nations were not there, perhaps I would not have built it in that location, so it means quite a bit to me.
My involvement with the United Nations began with a letter, which I will give to the Subcommittee, from the Ambassador to the United Nations from Sweden, and it is a long letter and a very beautifully written letter, and essentially he read an article about the success of Trump World Tower, which is the building that I can show you right here, which is, as you can see, very substantially taller than the United Nations, bigger than the United Nations. And he read an article in the New York Times saying that the building cost approximately $300 million to build.
So he wrote me a letter and ultimately called me and said, ""Is it possible that that building cost $300 million, because it just seems so much bigger and so much better and so much more expensive and so much more luxurious, and how could you have done that for $300 million?"" When at that time, Senator, they were talking about $1.5 billion to renovate the United Nations and this was around December 2000. I said, well, there are only two reasons, either gross incompetence or something far worse than that, and you know what the something is, and that is corruption, because there is absolutely no way that that building could have cost $1.5 billion to build.
And I did a chart, and I looked at other buildings, and I heard the numbers today. I am very impressed with Mr. Burnham, but Mr. Burnham, it is not his business. Mr. Burnham is in a different business. The man he hired who has done some work, I guess, has just been on the payroll for 2 days, so perhaps he will be a great genius and he will bring down the cost to what it should be, which I think is about $700 million tops, and that is complete.
But I did a little chart, and I looked at buildings that were comparable that I built, and I looked at fees also, architectural fees. The architectural fee for this building -- and you have to understand a residential luxury building is far more complex than an open-floor office building to build. It is much more. You have many more bathrooms, you have many more kitchens, you have many more rooms. It is more complex. An office building is essentially open space with subdividers.
So I looked at it and I added up some of my costs, and for Trump World Tower, across the street, built not long ago, I spent approximately $258 a foot. It is the tallest residential building in the world, $258.32 a foot. I have 871,000 feet. It cost $225 million to build.
Anybody that says that a building of renovation is more expensive than building a new building does not know the business, because you have a frame built, you have your foundations built. You have in many cases elevators that can be reutilized in their entirety, but fixed. You have many components that can be used, and it only costs a fool more money.
I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel from the old Commodore Hotel. I did Trump International Hotel and Tower from the old Gulf and Western Building at 1 Central Park West, if you remember. I did the Trump Park Avenue Building from the Delmonico Hotel. I love doing renovation because it costs you half. It does not cost you more, it costs you less if you know what you are doing.
Now, if you do not know what you are doing, it can be fraught with cost overruns, etc.
So I looked at a couple of other buildings, 40 Wall Street is a building which is unfortunately and sadly now the tallest building in downtown Manhattan, sadly because the World Trade Center came down. It replaced 40 Wall Street. It was actually the tallest building in the world for a period of 1 year, and then superseded by the Chrysler Building and then the Empire State Building. But downtown Manhattan, it was superseded by the World Trade Center, 40 Wall Street is approximately 72 stories tall. It was a complete gut renovation identical to what you are doing. We put all brand new windows, brand new everything in it, and I have a renovation cost of, let us say, $100 a foot if you add everything, and that would mean that your job would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of half the number that you are talking about, and even less.
The way I look at it, the number that they are talking about -- and I agree with Senator Sessions -- is close to $600 or $700 a foot. They are not adding garages. And by the way, garages are very inexpensive to renovate, so that brings the number way down. They are not adding a lot of things that have to be added.
When I went to see the Administration, and when I went to see Kofi Annan, I was actually quite excited because I thought that I could save this country, this world, everybody including myself, a lot of money just by sitting down and having a meeting. Unfortunately, as our great Senator to my right said, there was just no response. They did not really care. It got a lot of press. I walked into the room and I sat down. I felt like a head of State. I was sitting with Kofi Annan, and a door opened, and there were literally hundreds of reporters taking my picture. I said, ""What are we doing? I just want to tell you I can build a building a lot cheaper."" And that was the end of it.
I wrote letters, and you have copies of the letters. I wrote letters after the meeting. I thought the meeting went amazingly well. I was expecting a call the following day from -- whether it is Kofi Annan or his people -- at that time it was a man named Conners. I met with Mr. Conners.
Mr. Conners did not know the first thing about what he was doing. He did not know whether or not the curtain wall was going to be new, old, and did not even know what a curtain wall was. I said, ""What are you going to be doing with the curtain wall?"" He said, ""What is a curtain wall?"" Now, he was in charge of the project. The curtain wall is the skin of the building. I said, ""Will it be new or old?"" He said, ""I don't know."" I said, ""Are you using New York steam or are you using a new boiler system?"" He said, ""I don't know what New York steam is."" It is a very common form of heating in the building. He had no clue.
The price, at that time, was $1.5 billion. I do not know why it came down because the world has gone up, but it came down. That was in the year approximately 2000 to 2001. So he did not have a clue. I do not know if he is still there. Perhaps he is.
The one thing I found him very good at is that he did not want to lose control of this project. He was a man that absolutely wanted to keep control of the project, but he did not have even the slightest inkling of what it was all about, knew nothing about it.
He then told me that he may move people out, he may not move people out. He did not know. He thought he might. He was not sure. He just did not know. So I went through a whole list of questions for him, and then I realized that the United Nations is in serious trouble, because the $1.5 billion that they were talking about, there was no way it was going to happen for that.
And I say today that the $1.2 billion, which they brought down even though it is basically the same work and even though things have gotten more expensive, so I do not know why they brought it down because I do not think they brought it down for any particular reason. But the $1.2 billion, in my opinion, I will be sitting here in 3 years, and I will be saying -- and I am going to predict that it will cost over $3 billion because they just do not know.
I was very impressed with Mr. Burnham, but again, you have to deal in New York City construction to see what tough people are all about, to see what tough contractors are all about, and if you have not done it, you are going to go to school and they are just going to take you to lunch, and you are just not going to even know what happened.
So this project at $1.2 billion, will cost in my opinion $3 billion. In my own opinion, however, in my real opinion, it should cost approximately $700 million.
I have been listening to a couple of different things, first, swing space. I do not think you need swing space. First of all, what landlord in New York is going to rent space for a year and a half or 2 years? Who is going to do that? You are going to give up a building for a year and a half or 2 years and say, oh, good, you just go in, mess up my building for a short term and then move out. Nobody is going to do that unless they are totally desperate, and you do not have to be desperate in New York. It is the hottest real estate market in the world, today probably, and I am saying where are they going to find this space to start off with? It is going to be a disaster. And if you know New York City landlords, and some of you do, there is no worse human being on earth.
They are going to have more fun with these folks from the United Nations when it comes to signing that lease, and the United Nations, their heads will be spinning. Assuming there is honesty, their heads will be spinning.
So I do not know where they are going to get the space. They are going to have to pay so much, and no landlord is going to fix the space. You know, I am listening to these people that are very naive, and I respect them, but they are very naive in this world. Now, I might be naive in their world, but in this world they are naive to think that they are going to go into a building and rent hundreds and hundreds of thousands of feet of space -- if they can find such a building and I do not know of any building like that -- and then they are not going to have to pay for the renovation of that space and fixing up the space for a couple years.
Now, people do that but they sign 25- and 30-year leases. I do not mind going into an office building and fixing up space, but I sign a 30-year lease or a 20-year lease or at least a 15- year lease. These people are going to sign a 1-or a 2-year lease. It is ridiculous. So their concept of swing space, in my opinion, does not work from an economic -- and the number of $98 million is a joke because that number will be hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in just the renovation cost alone.
One of the things that I had mentioned to Kofi Annan and the whole group, when I was at the meeting, was that there was no reason to move anybody out. In New York City we have a lot of asbestos buildings, and there is a whole debate about asbestos. I mean a lot of people could say that if the World Trade Center it would not have burned down, it would not have melted. A lot of people think asbestos, a lot of people in my industry think asbestos is the greatest fire-proofing material ever made, and I can tell you that I have seen tests of asbestos versus the new material that is being used, and it is not even a contest. It is like a heavyweight champion against a lightweight from high school. But in your great wisdom you folks have said asbestos is a horrible material, so it has to be removed.
Space is constantly being renovated. Asbestos is constantly being gotten rid of with tenants in possession. You sit there. They wrap it, they conceal it, they do it. There are many professional firms. They move the asbestos. Estee Lauder's company, they did it while they were in possession. I could name a hundred tenants where it has been done while they sit in their offices, literally working. Sometimes it is done over weekends. Sometimes it is done at a little different time. They take sections of offices and they do it, and the people move from that section to another section and they are inconvenienced for a day and a half. And then they rebuild the office.
So the concept of moving to swing space, dealing with New York City landlords, is absolutely ridiculous.
Now, you can do the entire building. You can put new skin on the building. You can put new piping, you do not have that much piping because the bathrooms are all centralized. Not every office has a bathroom. It is not like an apartment house. But you can do this entire building, like I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I took the old Commodore Hotel and I made it into the Grand Hyatt Hotel on 42nd Street and Park Avenue. It is a great success. I have done this with many buildings. But it is not necessary to have everybody leave the building in order to rebuild a building, and you do not have to necessarily even do it at one floor at a time. You can either fix the skin or put a new skin on the building, and what you do is you do the roof first, and you seal it, and you get a 30-year guarantee. And what I do best in life is build, even better than ""The Apprentice,"" I must say.
The thing I do best is build. But you put a new roof, as I did with the Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt, you put a brand new 20- or 30-year roof that is a guaranteed roof, and now your roof is done, like an umbrella, and then you bring the skin down, and as you are bringing the skin down, you are taking the old skin off. So by the time -- and you literally have very little gap, very little space, but you are bringing the new skin down and just think of an umbrella. You are bringing the -- and you should put new skin. This skin has been up there for 60 years, it is over. You can copy the skin identically. You can copy the color of the glass identically. You can bring in all the modern technology including triple pane or double pane glass in terms of heat and cooling and everything else, but you bring the skin down and -- you have scaffold -- and as it is coming down, the old skin is coming off, everything is sealed up beautifully.
In the meantime, inside, your pipes are going up, your asbestos is coming out, your electric is being redone. You have companies that do nothing but redo electric. Now, these are different companies. You have companies that do new electric, they would not know how to redo electric. Then you have companies that redo electric, they do not know how to do new electric. I mean it is just a specialty.
But you have special people that redo apartments, which are being renovated all the time with people in possession, that redo all sorts of buildings. I just built a building on Park Avenue and 59th Street. I had tenants in possession when I did it. I mean I built a major building, essentially brand new, the old Delmonico Hotel, and I had people living in the building when I did a major $100 million job. It is a $200 million building. So the concept of moving to another location and getting everybody out of this building is absolutely asinine and will cost you so much money you are not even going to believe it, and then you are going to have to move in.
Many other things. When I did the Wollman Rink, the City of New York was boggled down for a period of 7 years. They had spent $21 million. It was a tremendous embarrassment to the Koch administration. And I said, ""I would like to take over the project."" And they said -- the New York Times came out with an editorial, the New York Post came out with a great editorial, and they said, ""Let Trump do it,"" and finally the city let me do it. And I rebuilt, and believe me, I used nothing that was there before. Everything had to be gutted out because it was totally incompetently done, 7 years, $21 million. I redid it -- and the Senator remembers this very well I guess -- I redid it in 3 months for $1.8 million, and it opened, and I still run it today, and that was quite a while ago.
This is no different, and in fact, in a certain way this is even easier. All week long you have tenants in New York renovating their space, you have buildings being renovated with what we call tenants in possession. There are tenants in possession, they are in possession of the space. Now, I listened to one thing and I have seen one thing and one number that sticks out more than all of the rest, because whether or not somebody does not know what New York steam is or what boilers and whether or not they have boiler rooms, which the people at the United Nations did not do. But the number of $44 million for an architect is one of the great numbers in the history -- in fact, I think this man is a genius, whoever he may be, wherever he may be in Italy. I think he is a great genius. I would like to meet him.
He is without question the richest architect in the world. And as one person said, ""I think they only got $500,000."" Another person said, ""I think they got a million dollars,"" and then changed their mind and it was $7.8 million. And then I listened to Senator Sessions, who actually did his homework, said they got paid $27 million, because you were able the check the books. So they got paid $27 million, have not done anything. They do not even have plans. Nobody even knows what they are building, and they got paid $27 million.
Now, I have respect for a lot of people, and I have great respect for architects, but I am going to give you an example. The tallest residential building in the world my architect got paid approximately $1.5 million. This architect got $44 million. A building at 40 Wall Street, my architect got paid, believe me, peanuts, I think, less than $1.5 million. In Chicago, where I am building a building of 92 stories at the old Sun Times site, 2.7 million square feet, which is more than the United Nations if you add up all of the projects that they are talking about, it is larger, substantially larger. I am spending $600 million and they are saying they are going to spend $1.2 billion, so they are spending much more, and this is a 92-story building with brand new structure, brand new foundations. I am building all the roads. Mayor Daley made me build roads around the building. I had no choice. Otherwise, if you know Mayor Daley, you are not going to build the building. He is a great man but he made me do that. So all of this is $600 million, and they are spending $1.2 billion.
Now, there is no way they are spending $1.2 billion, in my opinion, and based on what I have heard. When they have spent $27 million and terminated the architect, there is big trouble, because I do not think they have a new architect. So if they do not have a new architect, who is going to do the plans and who is going to do the bidding? Because in order to do a job, you have to have a complete set of plans and specs. If you do not have a complete, finished, set of plans and specs, you have nothing to bid on, there is no way you can bid. The worst thing you can do -- and you said you were in the home building business for a while -- the worst thing you can do, as you know, is start a job without complete plans and specs because the subcontractors will eat your lunch. So it is one of those things.
So they do not even have an architect. They spent $27 million and they do not have an architect. Now, I have asked on numerous occasions, to go in and I would help them. I would love to help them. I do not want any money. I want nothing. I have made a lot of money. I do not care. I want nothing. If somebody said, what would be your dream on this site? Well, my dream is a dream that will not happen, but it is a dream that I might tell you. It is a dream to take the United Nations -- the Senator over here is probably going to go crazy -- move it to the World Trade Center as a brand new United Nations, sell the United Nations site -- which is one of the greatest sites in the world -- for much more money than the whole thing would cost -- and you end up building a free United Nations at the World Trade Center, where I do not think anybody is going to want to stay anyway. I think it is going to be a very hard rent up at the World Trade Center.
But let us assume that is not going to happen -- not a bad idea though --
Not too bad. He has no problem. Most people do not have --
OK. I will not get into -- I did not say that. But the fact is that the United Nations building, with all of its buildings, with its parking, should be completed -- and I mean completed -- at a cost of $700 million. And it is my opinion that it will not be completed for less than $3 to 3.5 billion. They do not know what they are getting into. And please remember this, as somebody that has probably built as much as anybody my age anywhere -- I do not know of anybody who has built more -- if you do not have a complete set of plans and specifications, there is no way you can build. And from what I understand, they do not even have an architect.
One final point. They give you some nice firms, Turner and this one, and Gardiner and Theobald. The fact is that I can take those same firms and tell them the way I want it built, and those same firms will come up with prices that are half the price that they are coming up with. They are being told what to do by people who do not know what they are doing. So if I take Turner Construction, which is fine, or if I take a couple of other -- and by the way, when I say ""fine"", fine but Rolls Royce. They spend money. But if I take a couple of those firms, and if I show them the right way to do it, and if I lead them down the right way -- which is really what a good developer does -- that number that they are coming up with will be cut in half.
So that is it. Congratulations, you have yourself a mess on your hands, and it is only going to get worse.
I think any professional -- I was speaking to somebody very professional, Richard LeFrak before. He said he just gave out an architectural contract on a million foot building for $1.5 million, not $44 million, $1.5 million, so it is the same size, $1.5 million.
I would say that because of the United Nations in terms of security and some enhanced needs, let us assume it is beyond even your normal high-grade office building -- which it is really not; essentially it is an office building. But let us add something for security. I would think you should easily do it for $250 a foot, easily. And that means complete. That is not adding up all of this other stuff, which by the way was not given to you. You have many things listed on that board that were not given to you.
They do not even have an architect so how can they start sooner than that? First of all, to do a good set of plans and specs is going to take you a good year, so if you do not have an architect even hired yet because the last one ripped you off or did whatever he did -- that guy is unbelievable. I mean this guy, I want to meet him. I can learn from that guy. So you have a man that got paid $27 million that you are not going to use. So now let us assume you have to start all over because no architect is going to take over somebody's plans in the middle. You just do not want to do that, OK?
The other thing is, how do you hire an architect from Italy? I love Italy. I love the Italians. How do you hire an Italian architect? What happens? Every time he wants to check the building, he gets on a plane and flies for 8 1/2 hours, and he goes to the New York City Building Department and he does not even speak English? I mean it is ridiculous.
So what they have is they really have a problem and I do not see how they can ever start. Now, if you put a developer like myself or like any one of five other people -- and I can only think of five -- in charge of a job like that, you could have that job started immediately. You could have the asbestos removed with tenants in possession. You could have the entire building rebuilt in less than 2 years.
You know, Kofi Annan asked me one question. At the time -- and I am only increasing it because of the fact that when I met him it was 4 years ago -- but at the time I said I could do it I think for $400 million versus their $1.5 billion. Slightly different number, right? He said, ""What would be the difference in the building?"" I said, ""The difference would be my building would be better, be much newer, much richer."" I was putting in all brand new marble floors on the ground -- I like marble -- I was putting in all brand new marble floors. They have all broken up terrazzo floors. Under their plan they were leaving these all broken floors. They are broken, old, and terrazzo is not exactly a great material, it is garbage. But I was putting in all brand new marble. I was putting in an all new curtain wall. They were going to fix their curtain wall. If you fix that curtain wall, it is a disaster. You have to put in a brand new curtain wall. You will get another 50 years. If you fix it, it is not the answer. It is going to leak, it is going to be a problem.
So he asked me the question, and I said, ""The answer is it is going to be better. It will be brand new in its entirely. You will not have to move anybody out. You will not have to go and build"" -- at that time they were talking about, as you remember, building a new building to house the people, and they were going to -- and they were actually thinking about then ripping the building down, so that is a real beauty. But they do not know what they are doing, so here I am.
No, I am not going to get it. First of all, they do not know what they want. They do not know what they have. They have no idea what they are doing. It is a problem where you cannot bid on a job like that. And I would not bid on it anyway. I offered my services free. I wanted to save close to a billion dollars, actually $1.1 billion at the time. I wanted to save a billion dollars for the United Nations, for the world, in a sense. I wanted to do it. I liked doing the Wollman Skating Rink. I mean this is a bigger version of the Wollman Skating Rink, that is all it is to me. And I said, ""I do not want a fee, I do not want anything."" They did not like the idea.
Now, the Senator would have his own reasons. He is stronger on it than me, but they did not want the idea.
I think that is not going to happen. I think it is a very interesting idea, but I think it is not going to happen. I love the idea of the downtown switch. Sell the land. You will make such a fortune on the land, etc. It is not going to happen from a practical standpoint. It should happen, but it is not going to happen. But just in terms of the renovation itself, you have to get the right architect. I mean there are architects and there are architects. You have to get the right architect, and you have to know who those architects are. I mean I can only think of five architects who would do a great job on this building. You have to know who the architects are. You have to get your plan started. You have to do it as a renovation, and the renovation should be done quickly, effectively, and in my opinion, by the end of 2007, this whole job should be complete. It can be started immediately because of the fact that you are doing it the way I am saying. Within 3 to 4 months of planning, you can start your contracts without extras. In other words, you can start what I call hard contracts, contracts without fluff and without extras.
I think the entire job can be done by the end of 2007. I promise you, Senator, they will not even have the people moved out by 2007.
Nobody has ever heard of such a number.
Their contingency number was what, $400 and some odd million?
Craziest number I have ever heard. My building in Chicago is $600 million. I believe we have a $30 million contingency, and of the $30 million, if I use any more than $3 or $4 million, I am going to be very angry at my people. That is a 92-story building. I have a $30 million contingency, and I do not expect to use it. I set aside $30 million. I expect that if I use more than $3 million, I am going to be a very unhappy camper. To have a $400 and some odd million contingency is totally unheard of.
Thank you.
Very good.
I would like to do -- it was amazing. The Swedish Ambassador just piqued my attention, and he should get a lot of the credit for this. I mean his letter is here. It is such a beautifully written letter, and it is written by a man -- I do not even know him -- it is written by a man of great common sense.
Four years ago.
Right. I could have built it twice.
Well, actually, Mr. Burnham said, ""I would like to call you tomorrow,"" and I thought that was terrific. Honestly, I thought that was terrific. This is what I do. This is what I do the best. And I am in New York. And as the Senator said, Senator Sessions, New York is a tough place to do business. You know, I have had great success, and sometimes you take your lumps. You have to know the contractors. I know ever contractor in New York. I know the ones that are going to -- I am not going to say the words, there is too many wonderful women in the room -- but I know the contractors that are going to, ""take advantage of you. I know the contractors that are slow. I know the contractors that are fabulous, that do not ask for extras. I know all of them. I know the good ones and the bad ones.""
I told a friend the other day -- he was doing his apartment, he told me the contractor -- I said, ""Do not use them."" This was about a year ago. He got killed by this guy. He got killed. I said, ""Use somebody else."" He came to me the other day, he said, ""I should have taken your advice.""
The United Nations people do not know. We have major slime in New York, and much of that is in the form of contractors. Is that not a sad thing to say? And every one of them, I guarantee you, will find their way to the United Nations.
That is true, you have had your own difficulties with that.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You're fired.
"
Donald Trump,"When I got elected, you had some people that said, this is going to be the greatest thing to ever happen to our country. I guess that's why I won. We had a lot of people.
But you had others that say, oh the market will collapse. Lots of bad things will happen. And take a look at what's happened. We have the greatest, longest, bull market in the history of our country.
They turned out to be wrong. Some have actually apologized, but very, very few. I think the rest will soon be apologizing, because, honestly, the American public demands an apology.
We are doing better financially as a country than we've ever done before.
"
Hillary Clinton,"Well, thank you very, very, much. I am delighted to be back at GW and I want to thank President Trachtenberg for his kind introduction, but he and his wife Francine have been leading advocates on behalf of higher education and so many other issues for as long as I've known them, and that goes back many years. And as Joel said, we shared the experience of our children in high school, and that was indeed an experience we both survived, so we're grateful to tell the tale.
I want to thank Dr. Williams, and, of course, Dr. Becker. I want also to recognize Russ Ramsey, the chair of the board, Dr. Scott, Dean of the Medical School and the CEO of GW Medical Faculty Associates, Stephen Badger. It is an honor to be back at GW in order to talk about one of the most important issues facing the health care community, and of course, our country.
As I travel around America, I have talked with people from all walks of life about the challenges that our country is facing: from ending the war in Iraq to ending our dependence on foreign oil -- from improving our education system to reducing our deficit. And no matter where I go or with whom I talk -- whether it's small business owners or CEOs, doctors or nurses or patients -- I hear growing concern about the crisis in our health care system: exploding costs, declining coverage and shortcoming in care and prevention.
Now, I've tangled with this issue before -- and I've got the scars to show for it. But I learned some valuable lessons from that experience. One is that we can't achieve reform without the participation and commitment of health care providers, employers, employees and other citizens who pay for, depend upon, and actually deliver health care services. I think we finally have a recognition that everyone sees there is an economic imperative to rein in costs. There is a moral imperative to extend coverage to all Americans. And, there is a practical necessity to promote wellness and prevent illness wherever possible. I plan to put those lessons to work to ensure every single American has quality, affordable health coverage.
There are three parts to my approach. First, lowering costs for everyone. Second, improving quality for everyone. Third, insuring everyone.
Today, I will focus on the challenge of lowering costs.
Health care costs are spiraling out of control. Premiums have almost doubled since 2000 -- increasing four times faster than average wages.
Every day, parents choose between paying the premium for themselves or their children. Small businesses wonder how they will stay afloat when their health care costs eat up their profits year after year. CEOs of major American companies worry about how they will succeed in the global economy when they're competing with foreign companies that spend significantly less on health care.
We spend 16 percent of our gross domestic product - $2 trillion -- on health care. And by 2016, health costs are scheduled to exceed $4 trillion, or almost 20% of GDP. That means that within less than 10 years, 20 cents out of every dollar produced in America will be spent on healthcare. No other country spends more than 12%, a difference of more than $500 billion. All other wealthy countries spend even less. We spend $5,711 per patient. The next highest spending country, Switzerland, spends $3,847 on patients. Yet, they cover every single one of their citizens and have an average life expectancy that is three years longer than ours.
Now, how have our costs spiraled out of control like this? Well, about 30% of the rise in health care spending is linked to the doubling of obesity among adults over the past 20 years. In other words, if our obesity levels had remained at 1990 levels, we would be spending 10% less on health care today -- a savings of $220 billion. About two-thirds of the rise in health care spending is associated with a rise in the prevalence of treatable disease - like diabetes, asthma and heart disease. 75% of all health care spending -- roughly $1.5 trillion -- is associated with the 4 to 5 percent of patients who have multiple chronic illnesses and require ongoing medical management over a period of years, or even decades. And 10-12% of the total health care budget is spent on end of life care.
Our administrative costs are by far the highest in the world. Today more than one in four health care dollars goes to administration. 64% of private insurance plans' administrative costs are dedicated to underwriting health risks, sales, and marketing. Every man, woman and child in America spends $412 on health care administration, nearly six times as much as other countries. According to a recent report by McKinsey, the United States spends 98 billion more than other countries on excessive administrative costs that have nothing to do with delivering good health care.
Too much of the money we spend is wasted on care that doesn't improve health. A study in Santa Barbara, California found that one out of every five lab tests and X-rays were conducted solely because previous test results were unavailable. A recent study reported in the Atlantic Monthly found that for two-thirds of the patients who received a $15,000 surgery to prevent strokes, there was no compelling evidence that the surgery actually worked.
At the same time, in situations where the benefits of intervention are clear, many patients still don't receive the care they need. A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that, overall, Americans get needed care only 55 percent of the time.
If we spend so much, why does the World Health Organization rank the United States 31st in life expectancy and 40th in child mortality -- worse than Cuba and Croatia?
Our health care system is plagued with under-use, overuse and misuse. It is, simply put, broken. As President, I will make it my mission to fix it, starting by helping the 250 million people with public or private insurance who face skyrocketing costs, inadequate care, and bureaucratic obstacles to coverage.
Today, I'm announcing a seven point plan to lower health care costs for all American and again to make our healthcare system, without doubt from any corner, the best in the world. Building a national consensus around these cost savings is the first crucial step to cover all Americans with quality, affordable healthcare.
First, we're going to focus on prevention -- on wellness, not just sickness. Under my reforms, all Americans will have access to comprehensive preventive care, which will save money in the long run.
Today, we pay doctors and hospitals to treat diseases and injuries, but not to help prevent them from occurring in the first place. Only 38 percent of adults receive recommended colorectal screening, and roughly 20 percent of children do not receive recommended immunizations. In fact, our country spends only an estimated 1 to 3 percent of national health expenditures on preventive health care services and health promotion per year. That is about the same percentage we spent in the 1920s.
For example we have many more adults and young people being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. While, the costs of caring for them are increasing exponentially, many insurance companies won't pay for someone who's pre-diabetic or who's been diagnosed with diabetes to go to a nutritionist to learn how to eat properly, to get preventive medicine or to go to a podiatrist to have their feet checked. But the companies will pay if you have to have your foot amputated. The insurance companies will actually tell you they don't want to pay for preventive health care because the patient might change insurance companies, and the original company won't get the benefits of the money they invested. But if a patient's doctor tells them that a foot needs to be amputated, well the company is kind of stuck with that. Talk about a system that is upside down and backwards.
We clearly need a new approach. We know we can save money if we give insurance companies incentives to cover preventive care and wellness services -- and my plan will do exactly that. Keeping people healthy today will not only keep our costs down in the future, but improve quality of life as well.
We know that preventive care works. I could cite thousands of examples, but just consider the following: The incidence of diabetes was 58 percent lower among adults with elevated blood sugar were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program than the control group that was only given drugs. Among those aged 60 and older the reduction was 71 percent. And some of the research that was done leading to these outcomes was right here at GW.
Or look at what the private sector has tried to do. Safeway has made a conscious decision to focus on prevention. It pays 100% of all appropriate preventive care services, and it offers a 24-hour hotline staffed by registered nurses, and provides services to help people manage chronic conditions and incentives designed to promote healthier lifestyles.
Again, the results speak for themselves. While average costs went up 7.7% across the country. Safeway its health care costs will be flat. And they aren't the exception: Motorola's wellness initiative showed savings of almost $4 per every dollar invested.
Under my plan, all insurers who are already participating in a federal health program like Medicare or Medicaid or the federal employee's health benefit plan will have to cover prevention as a condition of doing business with the Federal government. Insurers would encourage both individuals and providers to use prevention services by paying for benefits like cancer screenings and immunizations.
My plan also pools and coordinates federal spending on prevention to help redeploy high-priority preventive services. Working in collaboration with the private sector, this initiative would pay for preventive care initiatives in schools, workplaces, supermarkets, churches, communities. It would fund and train new health prevention outreach workers, who understood the language, understood the culture of various constituencies around our country. Now, we still have so many people, and I'm sure you see it in the hospital, who come in unable to speak English, often times bringing a child to interpret. And we're just not doing a good enough job in getting information broadly available to people who need it.
Now, of course, you can have the best insurance plan in the world, but if you don't take the medicine your doctor prescribes, or follow lifestyle advice your doctor recommends, you aren't going to improve your health. If we're going to reduce costs through prevention, all of us all must take responsibility for taking better care of ourselves and I will have more to say about that later.
The second way to bring costs under control is to bring our health care system's record keeping into the 21st century, finally leaving behind paper records and outdated, obsolete, 20th century information technology. Right now, if you're rushed to a hospital with a medical emergency, they may not be able to access your medical history or to find out what medications you're taking, what surgeries you've had -- or even what your blood type is. Electronic medical records would change that.
This is also important in the event of catastrophes. After Katrina, medical records were under water, never to be recovered. A lot of people who were taking prescription drugs who fled their homes or were rescued didn't even know the names of the drugs they were taking. Only, those who had been buying drugs from drug stores that had electronic medical records could immediately access to find out what the drug was and what the prescription should be.
Modernizing our system will improve quality of care and reduce costs. Today, processing paper claims costs an average of $1.60 to $2.20 per claim. It costs 85 cents for an electronic claim. A RAND study found that, as a nation, we could save more than $77 billion annually through the widespread use of electronic medical records, and these savings could double with the addition of prevention and chronic disease management. If the use of information technology impacts our health care system as much as it has impacted other sectors of the economy, like for example, the wholesale and retail industry, we could see savings as high as $346 billion annually or over 15% of health care spending.
There is no reason why people's health files -- their test results, lab records, X-rays -- can't be stored securely and confidentially on a computer file accessible from a doctor's office or hospital. In fact, if all hospitals used a computerized physician order entry system, an estimated 200,000 fewer adverse drug events would occur, saving roughly $1 billion per year.
We can also use information technology to disseminate research. A government study recently showed it takes 17 years from the time of a new medical discovery to the time clinicians actually incorporate that discovery into their practice at the bedside. Why not 17 seconds, the moment we know the discovery improves care?
The Veterans medical system provides a perfect example of a fully automated health information system that supports the needs of patients, clinicians, and administrators.
The VA started modernizing its programs in 1993, using health IT as well as other care management techniques. And it delivers some of the best quality health care in the United States with amazing efficiency. So the VA has not only has become one of the health care industry's best quality performers, it has done so while spending less and less on each patient. Health care spending per capita averages, as I said, over $6,300 in the U.S.; at the VA, however, the per-patient cost is $5,000, and 20% lower than the national average, even though the average age of a VA patient is 60.
Last year I was at the hospital here at GW announcing legislation that has since passed the Senate that promotes the use of information technology so we can end the paper chase, limit medical errors and reduce the number of malpractice suits. It would allow us to use IT to develop a nationwide, interoperable system, to streamline our healthcare costs, and, I believe, reduce errors as well. Now, I'm proud of my legislation, we didn't get it passed in the House last year, we're going to try again this year. But if we don't get it passed, I will have it as one of my highest priorities as President. I'm going to build on that legislation by requiring health providers that participate in federal programs, which is nearly all of them, to adopt private, secure, and interoperable technology. And to help hospitals and doctors modernize their systems and promote the widespread adoption of health IT, I would invest $3 billion a year in grants to help ramp up the system. No more yellowing paper records -- no more trying to decipher messy handwriting.
Third, we're finally going to coordinate and streamline the care our chronically ill patients receive. Americans with chronic disease such as heart disease and diabetes account for an astonishing percentage. When I first saw this, I couldn't believe it----that it was 75 percent of our national health care expenditures. And improving the quality of their care will help limit costs, and improve health.
To that end, I propose establishing medical ""homes"" similar to those operating right now in Oregon. Dr. David Dorra, a primary care physician, spoke at the Senate Aging Committee, on which I serve, two weeks ago about the success of these medical homes. He told the story of a patient, Ms. Viera, a 75 year-old woman in Oregon who suffered from five chronic illnesses, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and mild congestive heart failure. She also had difficulties remembering what bills to pay and what pills to take.
Now, in most clinics across this country, Ms. Viera would receive care from qualified, capable doctors and nurses. But her care would likely not be coordinated -- her providers wouldn't be talking to each other, making sure that the treatments they were prescribing were working together. This ends up raising costs and increasing the chances that she will suffer complications or end up back in the hospital. Anyone who has ever tried to coordinate their own care, or the care of a loved one, knows that this is all too common situation.
Fortunately, her care was addressed comprehensively through Care Management Plus in Oregon, an IT system with trained care managers in primary care clinics to treat older adults with complicated conditions. She's is in good hands. Her care managers and her primary care physician addressed her symptoms early, preventing problems rather than treating them after they occurred. And she is helped to navigate the system.
Under this program, seniors with complex diabetes have had a 20 percent reduction in mortality, a 24 percent reduction in expensive hospitalization, and up to 42 percent improvement in control of their disease.
Every patient should have access to a system with outcomes like that.
We know that this coordinated care model would result in significant cost savings. A recent RAND study concluded that chronic disease management, preceded by prevention and backed by information technology, could save $147 billion annually. Another study found this model could reduce the cost of diabetes care alone by 3 percent, saving us $4 billion dollars.
Fourth, my plan will offer will offer individuals and small businesses market access to larger insurance pools that will lower costs and end insurance company discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. As part of a plan for universal coverage, which I will discuss in detail in the coming months, we would create large insurance pools that lower administrative costs for small businesses and individuals by spreading the risk. In a system of universal coverage insurance companies cannot as easily shift costs through cherry picking and other means.
In fact, according to a recent McKinsey report, insurance companies in America spend tens of billions a year figuring out how not to cover people -- doing complicated calculations to figure out how to cherry pick the healthiest persons, and leave everyone else out in the cold. That is how they profit: by avoiding insuring patients who will be ""expensive"" -- and then trying to avoid paying up once the insured patient actually needs treatment.
I see this all the time. My office spends countless hours arguing with insurance companies to get my constituents the health care they have paid for. For example, a father called me from northern New York -- his son had a rare illness. Now he and his son were well insured. He'd worked for many years for the same employer who provided a good policy. But when his son needed a special operation -- that could only be performed at one place in the country -- the insurance company said, sorry, that's out of network, we're not going to send you to have that done.
So my office intervened. And in the end they got permission for the operation. But I don't think people should have to go to their United States Senator to get their insurance company to give them what they've paid for.
As President, I will end the practice of insurance company cherry-picking once and for all by allowing anyone who wants to join a plan to do so and prohibiting insurance companies from carving out benefits or charging higher rates to people with health problems. I also will call for rating reforms to ensure that older and other vulnerable populations are not discriminated against. The whole point of insurance, lest we forget, is to spread risk across a group of enrollees. It's one of the reasons that the administrative costs of Medicare are so much lower; because they are actually insuring everyone. Everyone is in the pool, and we have to figure out how to better control the costs within Medicare but they start with an advantage because they have such a considerably lower administrative cost.
Finally, insurers would be required to prove they were spending much less on marketing and schemes to avoid providing insurance to high-risk Americans, and more on direct care-giving. Now most businesses and some states have become tough purchasers of health insurance, insisting on fair marketing and cracking down on high overhead. We should follow their lead. One of the things I've advocated now for 14 years is a common vocabulary and a common form that every insurance company must use. This sounds like a pretty common-sense idea---so you can actually compare and contrast what you're paying for---but when I proposed in back in â€˜93 and â€˜94 it was, shall we say, vigorously objected to. Because we need more transparency and we need that common vocabulary in order to get costs down, and that's opposite of what the insurers want to happen. By insuring all Americans through accountable public and private plans, we can get rid of administrative costs that do nothing but add to insurance companies' bottom line. In such a reformed system, risk would be widely spread and we could reduce administrative costs by as much as $20 to 30 billion a year.
Fifth, I will work to improve the quality of care which will also help us drive down costs. I'll start by establishing an independent public-private Best Practices Institute. This Institute would be a partnership among the public and the private sector, to finance comparative effectiveness research, so that doctors, nurses and other health professionals -- as well as consumers and businesses -- would know what drugs, devices, surgeries and treatments work best. This would reduce the use of inefficient and ineffective treatments, and I believe that it would have tremendous benefits because we could get evidence-based medicine into the bloodstream of the country much more effectively. I spearheaded a similar proposal to authorize the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to start doing research on comparative effectiveness at the Department of Health and Human Services. Eight reports have been released and dozens more are underway.
One of the things they're finding is a lot of these so-called ""blockbuster drugs"" are no more effective, and sometimes less effective, in treating conditions than old standbys that have been around for a long time, and don't have all the advertising of, you know, people running through fields of wildflowers that convince patients that they need the new drug, as opposed to the one that has worked well.
Too often, doctors and patients don't know which medical interventions are most effective -- and which have little benefit. A recent study by Dartmouth researchers shows that close to one third of the $2 trillion we spend goes to care that is duplicative and fails to improve patient health -- in fact, the researchers posited that it may even make health worse. More care is not necessarily better care, and inefficient care may do more harm than good.
My plan will provide incentives to encourage doctors to keep up with the research and prescribe the most effective treatments. The University of Michigan and Pitney Bowes are doing just that -- linking out of pocket drug costs to clinical benefit for patients. The more effective the medication, the less that patient has to pay for the drug. As of 2005, Pitney Bowes had saved more than $3.5 million dollars using this method.
Another innovative idea is the Geisinger Health System's suggestion of a medical warranty: it charges a flat fee for surgery that includes 90 days of follow-up treatment. Currently, there is little incentive to seek out the most effective treatments, because if a treatment regimen or surgery doesn't work, the patient simply returns for more costly treatments. The warranty is an incentive to do it right the first time, because there is no extra billing if more care is needed. Geisinger doctors have identified 40 essential steps to bypass surgery, and they've established procedures to ensure they're always followed.
The Best Practices Institute will empower with information and evidence those who have to make the decisions. It will not only be beneficial with respect to pharmaceuticals but also medical devices and even practice protocols and I think that it will give a lot of doctor's ammunition against insurance companies, drug companies and even sometimes patients about what works better than other options. The Oregon drug effectiveness review founded by Governor John Kitzhaber in 1999, is a collaborative partnership between states and non-profits that conducts reviews of widely used drugs to promote the most effective ones. North Carolina has used such reviews to educate providers, saving the state an estimated $80 million in 2003 alone. Now I can't extrapolate how much we would save as a nation, but I believe it would obviously be in the billions.
Sixth, if we want to get health care costs under control, we need to get prescription drug costs under control. We know that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs that we have already in most instances funded the research on funded the clinical trials on, done the FDA evaluation of, then we put it into the market place and we end up still paying the highest prices . Studies have shown that brand drug prices are 35 to 55 percent higher in the U.S., and top-selling medications a full 2.3 times more expensive compared to other industrialized countries. Over the past decade, prescription drugs accounted for 15 percent of the total increase in health spending, even though they account for only about 10 percent of what other countries spend.
Let's start getting drug costs under control by allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and to lower those costs for everyone. We also have to crack down on the overpayments in Medicare to private plans. These Private plan payment rates are around 12 percent higher than Medicare traditionally pays to treat the same beneficiaries. Reducing these overpayments could save Medicare $10 to $20 billion dollars a year. Seniors don't want to lose the benefits they have under these plans, but under my reforms they would not.
We should also allow the importation of drugs from certain countries to lower costs and let's remove barriers to generic competition. While 53 percent of all prescriptions are generic medicines, they account for only 12 percent of total pharmaceutical costs. A one percent increase in the use of generics could yield $4 billion dollars in government savings.
We need to break the monopoly that biotech pharmaceutical companies have over their products, which can cost us so much money. Most Americans have no idea that right now, under current law and FDA practice, generic biopharmaceuticals are precluded from going to the market. And businesses and consumers are paying for that. You know the cost differential between generic and non-generic drugs is astounding: in 2003, the average cost for a one-day supply of non-generic drugs was $45.00, but only $1.66 for generic drugs.
There is bipartisan support for providing the long overdue authority for the FDA to approve generic products that are the biologics. Already, an unprecedented coalition of patients' groups, labor, business, pharmacists, governors and a number of forward looking biotech companies have united to support legislation that I introduced with Senator Charles Schumer and Congressman Henry Waxman. Providing such competition is projected to save $5 to $7 billion dollars a year in savings to businesses and consumers.
The final point that I would make today about lowering costs is to reduce costs through medical malpractice reform. While some have overstated the role that malpractice insurance plays in the health care crisis, I think we can all agree that we need reform that works for doctors and patients alike.
I have offered one solution that has been used successfully at the University of Michigan Hospital system. It's a novel approach to improving patient safety and the quality of health care while protecting patients' rights, reducing medical errors and lowering malpractice costs. This Act would encourage physicians, hospitals and health systems to provide liability protections for physicians who disclose medical errors to patients and offer to enter into negotiations for fair compensation. At the University of Michigan, these policies have already resulted in greater patient trust and satisfaction, more patients being compensated for injuries, fewer malpractice suits, significantly reduced administrative costs and between one and three million dollars in litigation cost savings.
The rise in malpractice rates has spurred states like Texas and Nevada to allow doctors to create their own risk retention companies as an alternative to traditional liability insurance. Because a large percentage of actual malpractice is committed by a very small percentage of doctors who won't be included in insurance groups that other doctors control, thereby lowering malpractice rates for all.
Now as I have made clear in these seven points, we know that if we continue on our present path, health care costs in the U.S. will double within a decade, we know that we will spend increasing amounts and we aren't sure, and I think it is fair to say we know, that we won't improve quality and outcome.
Now how will this actually work? Well it has to be implemented over time according again to Rand who has been studying healthcare costs intensely now for several years. We could save $147 billion dollars from the information technology changes I have recommended, $20 to $30 billion dollars in administrative savings every year, $25 billion in savings from overpayments for pharmaceuticals and health plans, and there are billions more in countless other inefficiencies that could be rung out of our often wasteful health care system. We also will have to move toward a system where it is doctor-patient centered and consumer driven if we expect to really get the results that we need. Now there is no question that at least $120 billion dollars in projected savings that I have included in my plan are not only reasonable, but extremely conservative.
Now I know that a lot of this is kind of overly wonky, which is why I am glad there is an audience of people here today who really understand a lot of these issues, but I imagine, you know, many people wonder what all this adds up to. Well the Business Roundtable has recently estimated that just with a system that used information technology, the typical family would save $2,200 dollars, and I think that is a pretty impressive outcome for us doing what we need to be doing anyway.
The money we save from the waste we eliminate and the way we change how we care for people should be used to help finance coverage for the 45 million Americans who have no insurance. Also, when you insure everyone, it will maximize the impact of the prevention programs I have recommended -- with earlier care as opposed to emergency care -- as well as cutting administrative costs.
Our present system is outdated, ineffective, and unsustainable. We know how to do this. Many of you in this audience could give me ten more suggestions that we need to do immediately. Well the key is to develop the political will to make it happen through a coalition of those who are most directly affected. The people who deliver care, our doctors, our nurses our pharmacists and others, the people who pay for care, our business and our government and the people who receive care which is all the rest of us, because I know very well that every one of these recommendations will run into considerable opposition from forces that do not want change in our system.
So I believe that equally importantly to having a plan, we have to have a political consensus and that is what I am trying to develop as I talk about healthcare and engage in a conversation with the American people because I think Americans are ready for change. They are ready for a healthcare system that produces better results at lower cost and ends the shame of us not covering 45 million plus of our fellow Americans.
I look forward to your ideas about how we can pursue these goals and I hope you will join with me in being part of this broad based, national coalition that will not only talk about and demand change, but work to make sure, starting in 2009, that our political system actually delivers the changes we all know our healthcare system desperately needs.
Thank you all very much.
"
John Woodcock,"What a privilege it is to follow that heartfelt speech. It is also a coincidence, because, as the majority of the right hon. [Laughter.]
In 2010, when I first came into the House, we achieved the lowest swing away from Labour in the entire country. In the most recent general election, in 2017, I hung on by a mere 209 votes. As most people who looked at that will know, it is a total miracle that I am here at all. I never expected to be able to make a valedictory speech ​and I have viewed every single day of this Parliament as an extra, unexpected bonus. It was hard enough to hold the constituency of Barrow and Furness, the home of the Trident nuclear submarine programme, with the former Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. People, probably understandably, did not trust him entirely on the issue of Trident. However, it was an impossibility to hold the constituency with the current Leader of the Opposition. It was only by completely disavowing him that I was able, against all expectations including mine, to hang on.
I have, of course, paid in one way or another since then, but I will never forget the moment at 1 o’clock in the morning of election night when I thought, “My goodness, we might actually hold on here.” I had to get on the phone to my ex, Mandy, who ran my campaign to get me into Parliament in the first place, and say, “Look, you know I’ve offered to take the kids all summer, well…” I am deeply indebted to her for her forbearance on that and on so many issues, as we have made a crazy modern family life work. More on that towards the end of my speech.
I want to say how sad I am to be leaving, but I think we can be really proud of some the things we have achieved over these past nine and a half years. The brand new maternity unit literally would not have happened without the campaign led by local mums, including Mandy. Of course, I supported the campaign wholeheartedly —I knew what was good for me—but it showed that when the people of Barrow and Furness stand up, they are able to make themselves listened to. Together, we have effected real change.
The Leader of the House knows that it is more unusual to win a vote at the moment than it is to lose one, and 18 July 2016 will always be etched on my memory as the day that this House voted by 472 votes to 117 to renew Trident and fire the starting gun properly on the Dreadnought submarine programme, which, even now, is providing 9,000 directly employed jobs and sustaining the whole Furness economy. I am just sad to be leaving at a time when we are making critical decisions on how we ensure that that investment can lift the whole area out of the still really appalling pockets of deprivation and the lack of hope that remains in the Furness area. If I can play any role outside this place—possibly in a David Brent way, if I keep turning up to former offices—I want to play whatever role I can to ensure that that can happen in future.
I came into this House having been privileged to serve as a special adviser for a period in No. 10, and I never thought that the life of a constituency MP—trying to help the community change and lead that change—would be what drove me. That is what I will miss most of all from the job. It is well known in this place, but completely unknown outside it, how relatively little of that we drive ourselves as MPs, so—like many others—I need to give my heartfelt thanks to my team. Frank, Natalie, Angela, Carmen and the new arrival, Sian, have done extraordinary things. Literally thousands of people have had their lives changed for the better in ways that, more often than not, I have not known about personally, but they have delivered. I am so pleased that Cassie, my office manager, has come all the way here—it is a hell of a long way to get down from Barrow; it takes four hours on the train on a good day— and is in the Gallery today. Like a number of my staff—but none more so than ​Cassie—she has stuck with me through some really difficult times and has stayed loyal, and I will always be grateful for that.
As a constituency MP, I am proud of what we have done, but I wish that I could be proud of what we have achieved in our politics over the last 10 years. We are not standing here as a Parliament of success. I am sorry that my attempt to wrestle my politics—the politics of the progressive centre-left—out of the hands of the extremists that have gripped my former party has not been a success. I am really grateful to my friends—who will remain my friends—in the Labour party, even though we have taken a very different view on how best to tackle that extremism.
I am really excited about the challenge that I am going on to as the Government’s special envoy on countering violent extremism; I want to continue to play a role in public life. Although I am sad to be leaving, I am leaving for absolutely the best reason: it was not part of the script that Issy and I would be having a baby, but it is a wonderful, wonderful thing on which to leave. Their two sisters, Maisie and Molly, are going to be wonderful big sisters, and I just cannot wait for the future that we have got together.
"
Steve Brine,"I want to make three brief points. First, I welcome the Prime Minister’s statements last night and here today. For me, this is about making a balanced assessment of risk and learning to live with risk while exercising our judgment and—as the Prime Minister put it very well—good, old-fashioned British common sense about how our actions could impact our society and, yes, the NHS.
I have to say that I am saddened by the different emphasis from different parts of the UK overnight, but nations will exit lockdown at different speeds, as the infection rate varies. That is fine; it is called devolution. If we could not cope with difference within the United Kingdom, we should not have gone down the road of ​devolution in the first place. Having questions and stress testing a political decision is right. That is our job here on the Back Benches. Constantly picking for political advantage, and having what I suspect is a far worse argument in public than in private, is not.
Secondly, on the help offered, there has been a herculean effort on behalf of the Government on the furlough scheme and the self-employed help scheme. I welcome the fact that the latter is there as a safety blanket for over 90% of self-employed workers. However, that is not the case for those new to self-employment. I have a constituent who was made redundant less than a year ago and who put all his redundancy money into his new business. He is a wealth creator, but he is not eligible. If people are earning over the £50,000 profit limit—not a huge amount of money in many parts of the country—they are not eligible. Equally, if someone is the director of a limited company, they are not eligible. I understand that it is difficult, and as I have said to the Chancellor in this House before, the answer may be inelegant, but there has to be an answer. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is not averse to taking back what it thinks has been wrongly claimed. We need to get help to people now.
On the furlough scheme, I have to say that if we are to avoid the cliff edge as it draws to the end of its natural life, in its original form anyway, flexibility has to be the key—flexibility on the percentage paid perhaps, but only if that goes hand in hand with flexibility on the “no work while furloughed” rule; and flexibility on sectors, too, if the Treasury goes down that route. For instance, a food manufacturer in my constituency whose principal customers are classed as hospitality would be stuck between a rock and a hard place if the furlough scheme were withdrawn for manufacturing only. Flexibility must surely see the furlough scheme extended to hospitality businesses and their suppliers in that example. The Prime Minister hinted today about a statement from the Chancellor tomorrow on the furlough scheme, and I will be listening carefully.
Finally, the Royal Hampshire County Hospital is in my constituency, one of Florence Nightingale’s original hospitals, and I cannot praise it enough. The leadership, under Alex Whitfield, and staff there—many are my constituents—have just gone, as always, above and beyond. We, the local MPs, have a weekly call with the acute sector, primary care, the commissioners and the director of public health for Hampshire, and they keep us beautifully updated on the work that they are doing. The progress on delayed discharge in my hospital has been nothing short of remarkable. My trust is down to single figures on its delayed discharge numbers, and that is unheard of. Why? Because we have flattened the division between the decision making and the money trail within the NHS. We must not, we cannot go back: if it is to be health and social care, we cannot go back. On cancer, we must remember the people who have not presented to the NHS during this pause. We do not want to ditch the 75% ambition on cancer in the long-term plan.
"
Tracey Crouch,"Thank you for inviting me here today and giving me the opportunity to speak on an issue that I know many of you here share my passion for – sport and physical activity and how we can all collectively work together to tackle inactivity and the associated problems.
I want to start by paying tribute to the work of local authorities in delivering sports and leisure services.
I recognise that this is a difficult time for Local Authorities and that tough decisions are having to be made in terms of services delivered due to challenging financial circumstances.
The vast majority of sporting activity in this country is delivered at a local level and it is extremely important that this support continues.
But I also know that many of you will argue on a regular basis with your finance directors as to why investment in sport and leisure is needed at a time when every other directorate may have what seems like a stronger hand.
The truth is that investment in leisure not only can reduce the burden on more expensive budgets but it also builds and bonds communities, and helps tackle social problems, hidden or otherwise, that can quietly eat away at the core of society until it is too late.
It is for this reason that when I looked at rewriting the Sports Strategy we looked to local government and DCLG first to get initial thoughts. How you deliver what we wanted for the next ten years was going to be key. When I did media straight after one of the recurring questions was but government has cut local authority budgets…but my answer was always good local authorities get it. They get why this is important. And yes of course it may be delivered differently across the country, that is what local government is about, but not tackling inactivity by not providing sport and leisure services in an accessible and affordable way only stores up more expensive problems for councils down the road.
Your agenda today deals with much of this so I won’t repeat what they will say and instead outline some of the key points from the Sports Strategy, two years old next week.
The Sports Strategy was not about getting the active more active. Instead it stressed the importance of getting the inactive, active, and set out a new vision for a successful and active sporting nation.
It marked a big shift in the way we think about promoting, supporting and investing in sport and physical activity. It emphasised that we as a government, and a country, need to think more broadly about the benefits that getting active can bring.
We set out 5 key outcomes that we want to strive towards and that we want to see delivered in return for government support and investment. These were: * physical wellbeing; * mental wellbeing; * individual development; * social and community development; and * economic development.
I’m committed to making sure that these outcomes drive everything we do, and I’m pleased with how government and the sport and physical activity sector has responded to the challenge so far.
So what have we achieved?
On physical wellbeing Sport England has committed to spending at least a quarter of its total budget on tackling inactivity.
Sport England will be devoting much of its focus to supporting those groups who have been traditionally underrepresented to get more active.
For example, their Active Ageing Fund will invest up to £10 million into projects that help inactive older people get active.
Their Tackling Inactivity and Economic Disadvantage Fund is investing £3 million to support inactive people from lower socio-economic groups.
And their Tackling Inactivity in Colleges programme will invest £5 million in 49 colleges across England to help students be more active.
We’ve sought to tackle what people often feel is an artificial distinction between sport and physical activity. Not everyone likes the idea of playing sport. It provides an automatic barrier to many either because they think it is about getting sweaty or muddy or uber competitive. Or maybe people think they are too old for sport. Or not interested in team activities. But physical activity is different. Take what many of you already invest in – the health walks. I went on one locally and not a single person thought they were doing sport but through their hour long walk they were certainly doing something active and their physical well being was vastly improved as a consequence.
What matters is that people are getting active in a way that suits them and that makes them more likely to continue being active in future.
Mental wellbeing, the second outcome we are aiming to achieve with our strategy, is just as important as physical wellbeing.
And funding is already going to organisations that show they can best deliver this outcome, for example Sport England have invested a significant amount of government and National Lottery funding in mental health projects such as Mind’s Get Set to Go programme.
Get Set to Go has supported over 3,500 people to become active in local communities, and trained over 300 coaches and leaders in mental health awareness for sport and physical activity.
We encourage sports and mental health organisations to continue to work together to drive work in this area, improving mental health through sport and physical activity and changing lives for the better.
In terms of the third and fourth outcomes of our strategy, the impact sport and physical activity can have on individual and community development is significant.
We know there is a great deal of excellent work going on locally to demonstrate the impact of sport and physical activity.
I have seen the results first hand visiting a number of projects across the country which are using physical activity and sport to bring communities together and engage those who are less likely to be active.
For example I recently visited a project in Milton Keynes called MK SNAP, which is using sport and physical activity to help those with learning difficulties. Activities like yoga are really making a difference to improve the quality of the participants’ lives.
I have visited Active Norfolk’s Mobile Me project focusing on over 65s. It is designed to address barriers to participation identified by this age group, and take physical activity interventions into sheltered housing and residential care homes.
I’ve also been to Crawley Old Girls, a female football development group organised by the Crawley Town Community Foundation and the Football League Trust Female Football Development Programme.
Weekly sessions are held for women aged 40 and over, who have an interest and passion for football and who may not have had the opportunity to participate before.
And in Worcester I met Disability Sport Worcester, who specialise in creating and running sporting events, clubs and activities for children and adults with disabilities.
Of course, sport is also a significant contributor to the UK economy – and economic impact is the fifth of our key outcomes I referred to earlier. I see you have an agenda item later today about how sport can boost the visitor economy. I can’t stay for the session but I can give you a little nationwide taster…
In the UK, sport was valued at £35 billion in terms of Gross Value Added in 2015.
And as well as major events, grassroots sport contributes hugely too. People who follow sporting trends and buy the latest gear or purchase gym memberships also play their part.
It is important that we continue to build and capitalise on the economic growth of the sector.
However, there is still plenty of work to do in order to fully implement all of the actions set out in Sporting Future and the role for Local Authorities in delivering sport provision will continue to be crucial.
Local Authorities are the biggest public sector investor in sport and physical activity, spending over £1bn a year.
Your understanding and knowledge of communities is vital in targeting opportunities to encourage participation and designing services to suit.
You also have responsibilities that span wider policy areas which can have a significant impact on the physical activity of the local population, including management of rights of way, parks and other green spaces.
With increasingly devolved funding and opportunities for place based working we are keen to see innovative ways of engaging communities in sport and physical activity.
We must make sure that all investment into sporting and leisure facilities is well considered and provides an offer that is demand-based and led by the needs of the customer. We are working closely with Sport England and ukactive on their proposal to co-locate community services with sport and leisure facilities to encourage more people to participate in sport and physical activity.
I am keen that we continue to drive the development of local solutions to inactivity, with ideas like this.
With this in mind, it is my great pleasure to announce that 12 areas have now been confirmed as the Sport England Local Delivery Pilots. The full list is being published this morning but includes Bradford, Essex, Doncaster and Withernsea.
The aim of these pilots is to trial new and innovative ways of increasing participation in sport and physical activity at the local level and to make sure that this increase is sustained over time.
It’s about whole system change involving all local agencies, including small third sector organisations that work in the heart of these often disadvantaged communities we need to reach.
Sport England will be investing up to 100 million pounds over the next four years across these 12 areas to support this ambition. They will also be investing staff resource in working with the pilot areas.
This is going to be a huge challenge. We know that too often, investment in a particular project or place can yield a short term result but that as soon as the money stops, the gains can fade.
We want these pilots to be different.
We must make sure that we learn from the pilots, that we scale up what works in other areas and that we learn from what does not work so well.
The areas chosen as pilots include a good mix of urban, rural and coastal areas and a good geographic spread. This is deliberate, and will help the sharing and scaling up of learning across different areas.
This is a long term programme and Sport England will be working closely with these areas over the next four years.
We are not going to see results overnight, however this is a very important step in the right direction and Sport England will be monitoring progress carefully, as will I.
So in conclusion I would like to again take this opportunity to thank all of you for the huge part you already play in getting the nation active and I look forward to working with you to ensure Sporting Future is fully implemented and embedded in every community across the country. It is not going to all work overnight but with the right strategic direction in place and the will and enthusiasm of people like you I genuinely believe we can deliver the outcome of creating a fitter healthier nation for years to come.

Christopher Pincher,"The Government are committed to maintaining public confidence in the probity of the planning process at all levels, including the Secretary of State’s role in deciding called-in planning applications and recovered appeals. Rightly, Parliament has, through the planning Acts, delegated to local planning authorities the powers to determine things at their level. However, Parliament has also created provisions whereby a small proportion of cases are determined by central Government.
The written ministerial statement of June 2008 sets out clear criteria for the use of the powers. For example, some decisions are recovered because of the quantum of housing they involve and thus their potential effect on the Government’s objectives for sustainable communities; others are recovered because of non-determination by the local authority. The involvement of Ministers in the planning system is a very long-established process that is clearly guided by both the published ministerial code and the guidance published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on planning propriety, which focuses on the duty on Ministers to behave fairly and to approach matters before them with an open mind.
The vast majority of planning decisions are determined at a local level by local planning authorities. However, as I have said, the planning system provides for decisions to be sent to Ministers for determination, including on the grounds that they involve developments of major importance. In fact, Ministers were involved in 26 planning decisions out of a total of 447,000 planning cases last year. The small number of cases that are referred to planning Ministers for determination are often among the most controversial in the planning system—for example, the 500 dwellings in the Oxford green belt that were recently allowed, and the 500 dwellings in the York green belt that were refused.
Given the nature of the cases before them, it is not uncommon for Ministers to determine against the planning inspector’s recommendation, as has happened in around 20% of cases in recent years. In conclusion, I stress that each planning decision is taken fairly and on its own merits.

Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much. I've always wanted to be known as a doctor. And, Melania, from now -- from now on, you will address me as Dr. Trump. Sure she will. Well, you're about to begin a great new journey, and you never really know where that journey will take you. Look at me. I was a very successful real estate developer in New York City and they said, ""Do you mind doing a television show?"" So I said, ""I guess, what the hell."" And we did it. And then after I agreed to do it, I was speaking to my good friend John Myers, who runs a little thing called the General Electric pension fund.
What is that? A couple of hundred billion or something? Ridiculous like that. People don't know, people just don't know he's a great guy. And John and some of the NBC folks explained that 95% of the shows that go in the air failed. So I said, ""Why didn't you tell me this before I agreed to do it?"" But it became really something, and it went to the No. 1 show on television.
So here I am, I'm a star, and there's nothing like it. It beats real estate all the time. I hope each and every one of you realize how really important you are not only to your parents, and you owe them a very big thank you. But really, you have to realize that to yourself and if you do you're going to go out and conquer.
Graduation, really, is just a beginning. I graduated from school, we're all a little bit nervous. We never know what's gonna happen. We never know where the world is going, we're in a pretty, pretty frightening place right now, but I thought what I'd do is put down a few points so that you folks can go out and at least maybe have a guideline, because I've lived by this guideline, and it sort of worked.
We've had some little doubts every once in a while, but it's --  it's worked for me and I always begin by saying, ""You have to love what you do. If you don't love it, don't do it."" Don't let your parents push you into something, don't let your girlfriend, your boyfriend. Don't let anybody push you in. If you don't love it, don't do it, and probably you won't be very good at it. If you're doing something against your will.
It may not seem like the right thing at the time, but you've gotta love it. Another thing, give 100% of what you've got. No matter how long we're on this planet, if we're 80, 90 or a hundred years old, it's really just a speck of time, so give 100%. Just so important. Review yourself every day. How am I doing?
Especially now. How am I doing? What am I doing? Am I enjoying it? Am I doing it well? Do my bosses like me? What's going on? Review yourself. See how things are going. You're gonna have a lot of problems. Life is tough. In 1990, and John can tell you, I owed billions and billions of dollars and it seemed like there was no end.
Some people would say $9.2 billion. Nobody wants to owe that much money. I slept well, but the banks didn't. Now I'm all good. The fact is, I fought, I worked, and now my company is a much bigger, stronger, more solid company that it ever was before, much bigger than it was in the '80s, much, much bigger than it was in the '90s, but I never gave up. And honestly, the odds were against me, the Guinness Book of Records, other than this great recognition today, I think, in its own way, I'm very honored.
The Guinness Book of Records has me down as The Greatest Personal Financial Comeback Of All Time. Now I don't know what that means, because I just kept working. It's the same thing. The '90s weren't as good as the '80s. Then the end of the '90s were great, and now it's sort of better than that. But you just keep working.
Be disciplined. Don't lose discipline. Get out there and fight for everything. Don't lose discipline. And don't live on the edge like I do. You don't need it. You want to have a nice, folks, OK? Study something everyday. Learn. There's nothing like education. You know, I grew up right next to Wagner College, a lot of people don't know.
They see Trump Tower and they see Fifth Avenue. I love this. When John asked me to receive this great recognition? I was happy to do it. My father owned a job right next door Grimes Hill apartments and I would collect coins in the washing machines with my father, almost every Saturday. And we'd go around collecting on Howard, we'd just go around and collect.
And they usually wasn't too much money in there, but we'd collect. And he'd say, ""Come on, let's make the rounds."" And we'd stop at Wagner College a lot. And I happen to think -- and I've been to great colleges and great campuses. I happen to think that this is one of the most beautiful campuses anywhere in the United States I really believed it.
If you lose sight of the details, they can send you down. So keep that big picture in mind. Never lose sight of the details. Always -- and this is sort of a little bit tough to say, in terms of success, and I refuse to say it to this crowd. I refuse. Because you're much too idealistic. Always have a prenuptial agreement, but I'm not saying.
I will not say. Of course, half of my friends have been destroyed by divorce, but I refuse to say. I'll tell you, to me the second most important thing, after love what you do, is never ever give up. Don't give up, don't allow it to happen. If there's a concrete wall in front of you, go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of that wall.
I have so many people that I've seen over the years. If they just fought a little bit harder, they would have made, they would have succeeded, they would have accomplished their goal, but they gave up. Don't give up. Abraham Lincoln said, ""I will study and prepare, and prep -- perhaps, just perhaps, my chance will come."" And that's very, very true.
And just in closing, I'm going to say to you two words that I only said once on the apprentice. You are hired. Do well. Thank you.
"
Nancy Pelosi,"Have some observation about what we have seen. We thought we would have in hand. We’ll see. We come together today on a day that marks for the 18th straight week, the 18th straight week, more than 1 million people have filed for unemployment claims. We come at a time when today, they predict that we will reach 4 million cases in our country. What’s important about that is the steam roller. The acceleration that this has. It doesn’t diminish because people have filed for unemployment insurance, so we must have reached the peak. It continues. This is the Trump virus acceleration of all of this. Now, listen to this. It took just about 100 days to reach 1 million people. In fact, it took 43 days to get to 2 million. It took 27 days to get to 3 million and it took 16 days to get to 4 million.
That acceleration is an assault on the lives and the livelihood of the American people. If we want to open our schools, if we have to open our economy, we must defeat this virus. We had hoped with this legislation, the HEROES Act we put forth two months and one week ago, they said they needed a pause. Well, they still are not prepared. They didn’t use the pause to prepare. What we have seen so far falls very short of the challenge that we face in order to defeat the virus and in order to open our schools and to open our economy. Science, science, science, and science seems to be ignored. The delay, the denial, have caused deaths. We can do something about it, but we must have the appropriate response to it in terms of testing, tracing, treating, just dealing with the virus and not ignoring and saying, “Well, too many tests. And I don’t believe in tests” and all the rest of that.
So, we have a real challenge. Forgetting politics, forgetting partisanship, this is patriotism for our country. We’re up to four million people in a matter of just over two weeks from the three million mark. Hopefully, this bill will be too. Mr. Leader?
Thank you, Mr. Leader, you spelled it out perfectly. When I’m listening to you, I’m thinking, “What is it that the Trump Administration and the Republicans in Congress have against working families in our country?” As they sit around their table and join their corporate friends at the corporate board table, we have to be thinking about what’s going on at the kitchen table of America’s families. Many more people than ever, many people who never thought they would, are going to food banks, and yet, this legislation that they’re proffering has nothing to address food insecurity in our country. It’s about our children too. Millions and millions of children are food insecure, yet nothing there for that.
As the leader said, in terms of rent, people will be in the streets. The evictions will continue. Yet, in our bill, we have a proposal which does just that, modeled after some past initiatives for emergency security.
So, in the HEROES Act, we have, as you know, honor our heroes, which as leader says, their bill does not. Healthcare workers, transit workers, our first responders, food suppliers, sanitation workers, and the rest. Nix. They say no to that. In terms of what we have to do to address the virus, they are scientifically in absentia. They just don’t get it. They don’t believe in science. They don’t believe in governance. So, why should they pay attention to science and do something in governance about it? So, they make a token thing. And now they’re saying, “Well, we’re going to use some of the money we did before” which they didn’t spend before. So, this is a crisis. This is a crisis for our country.
I had hoped that, as we do in legislating, when they offered their bills before, they offered their first version of the CARES Act, we countered. When they offered the next version of the PPP, we countered. We offered this legislation. We thought they would counter with something that was at least reconcilable, but this doesn’t reconcile with the needs of the American people. It is another example of their dereliction in duty for not facing the reality of what this virus is doing to the lives, the livelihood, and actually, the life of our democracy. With that, we’re pleased to take any questions you may have. Yes, ma’am?
No, ma’am. This is a package. We cannot piecemeal this. This is, as you see, it has an integrity. It has a oneness about meeting the needs of the American people, defeating the virus as we honor our heroes and put money into the pockets of the American people.
Well, depending on what they come up with. What do you think, Mr. Leader?
Do you think we can do it by the end of next week?
What we have in the HEROES Act was a gift to them as a strategic plan for testing, tracing, treating, isolation. Of course, mask wearing, sanitation. So, the other day, when the president embraced mask, what he was doing was admitting how wrong he was for months, and in that period of time, many more people died. Even since we did the HEROES Act two months and one week ago, 2.5 million more Americans have become infected and 55 million more people have died while they were pausing. Some of them saying we don’t need anything more.
We learned some of it. Early this morning was what we learned from K street. That’s where they kind of-
You think we’re going to negotiate the amount of money here in this room? No. But let’s see … What’s really important to see their proposal, and that’s what the leader kept asking for. Put it on paper.
Specific.
Actually, what Leader McConnell had been saying, the impression he gave, was that he was going to be negotiating with the Senate Democrats, and then they would come up with something. As Congress works it’s will, one side makes a proffer, the other body then comes back with what they have. But to your point, they have nothing for state and local. In our bill, that’s $915 billion. State, local, tribal governments and territories. $915 billion. Go to speaker.gov/heroesact and see what it means to you and your community, and then understand it’s half of what they were willing to add to the national debt for their tax cut for the rich, 83% of the benefits going to the job 1%.
So, when you see what they have on paper, you see what they don’t have on paper. So, when they say a billion, a trillion dollars and nothing for state and local, nothing for food stamps, feeding the hungry, nothing for helping with rent and the rest of that. Nothing. So, many things they don’t have. Then you realize how they’re at a trillion dollar, how unacceptable it is. Yes, sir?
You want to speak to that? I mean, I’m all for the $600 because people really need it. But, again, as I said to you then, we have issues that relate to direct payments for people and the size of what that is and the rest. But I go to the table with the commitment to the $600. Mr. Leader?
It really has. I mean, they like to talk about the $600. I like to talk about the 83% of $2 trillion that they gave to the richest people, the top 1% in our country. Why are they worried about whether it’s 600 or 400 or 500? People really need that. As we try to bolster, look, we all know that there’s a floor for the stock market. That everything that is being done is to keep the stock market from going down past a point. Why can’t we have a floor for America’s working families? They bolster the stock market, which is not a bad thing. I’m not criticizing that. I’m just saying, it’s a fact.
Why do they have to make a fuss over $600 which means a lot to many working families in our countries, especially single moms in certain parts of the country where the unemployment benefit is very low? Again, we can try to help businesses as we try with PPP and the rest of that, and we can help them pay the rent and we help them pay their employees and we can help them pay the utility bill, but if they ain’t got no customers, they still have a problem, and this money is really important for people to spend, inject demand into the economy, create jobs. Yes, ma’am?
Let me just say that there is a great deal that is being said by the Republicans that is not true. You’ve heard me say many times, they’ll have an anecdote about somebody who didn’t go to work because they got 600. The plural of anecdote is not data. That’s our fundamental principle in the Appropriations Committee. We need data. Okay. So, we do know that millions of families in our country depend on that $600. “Oh, they’re not going to go to work.” Oh, we want … here’s what they’ll say. “We want them to go to work. They’re essential workers. We’re not going to give them any OSHA protections, and if they don’t go to work and take the risk to their lives and that of their families, if they don’t go to work, they can’t get unemployment insurance.” So, they’re there to sabotage working families. That’s why I say, what did working families ever do to the Republicans and the president that they’re out to get them? A.
B, they’ll say, as they’re saying, “Well, we’re not giving money to state and local because some of their governments are mismanaged.” We’re not talking about that. We’re talking about the receipts that they have for paying for coronavirus and the revenue lost because of the Corona virus all over the country, Democratic and Republican, nonpartisan, whatever you want to call it, red, blue, purple, whatever. So, they’re using an excuse that has nothing to do with the Corona virus. So, they’re engaged in distortions. Delay, denial, distortions. Very damaging to our economy, very deadly to our people.
Let me just take another person though, because that’s how we do it here. Yes?
And that’s the bill that is supported by the house Democrats as well. I hope the Republicans would join us. It’s very, very important. The use of stormtroopers under the guise of law and order is a tactic that is not appropriate to our country in any way.
Yes. Ma’am?
Well, to tell you the honest truth, we’re focused on trying to save lives with our bill to kill this virus, just to destroy this virus. We’re there to open up our economy and our schools. The fact that the behavior of one of the members is such that the whole women’s caucus, the Democratic Women’s Caucus, has gone to the floor at a time when our floor time is very precious, tells you how important this is. It’s a manifestation of attitudes in our society really. I can tell you that firsthand. They’ve called me names for at least 20 years of leadership, 18 years of leadership. I don’t know. It’s so funny is you’d say to them, “Do you not have a daughter? Do you not have a mother? Do you not have a sister? Do you not have a wife? What makes you think that you can be so,” and this is the word I used for them, “condescending.”
In addition to being disrespectful. I don’t want to say favorites, but one of the most is when we were discussing women’s reproductive health a number of years ago on the floor of the house, they were so angry with me because I had five children in six years to the day, so I had standing on the issue and they got up there and said on the floor of the house, Nancy Pelosi thinks she knows more about having babies than the Pope. Yes. So, there’s no limit to the disrespect or the lack of acknowledgement of the strength of women and nothing is more wholesome for our government, for our politics, for our country than the increased participation of women and women will be treated with respect. Thank you. Thank you all.
Opening day. Yes.
Say what?
What do I think of them kneeling? What do I think of the Giants kneeling? I’m so proud of Gabe Kapler, our new general manager, who knelt with them. God bless them.
"
Lyndon B. Johnson,"I have just concluded a meeting with the leaders of the Congress. I reported to them on the serious situation in the Dominican Republic. I reported the decisions that this Government considers necessary in this situation in order to protect American lives.
The members of the leadership expressed their support of these decisions. The United States Government has been informed by military authorities in the Dominican Republic that American lives are in danger. These authorities are no longer able to guarantee their safety and they have reported that the assistance of military personnel is now needed for that purpose.
I have ordered the Secretary of Defense to put the necessary American troops ashore in order to give protection to hundreds of Americans who are still in the Dominican Republic and to escort them safely back to this country. This same assistance will be available to the nationals of other countries, some of whom have already asked for our help.
Pursuant to my instructions 400 Marines have already landed. General Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has just reported to me that there have been no incidents.
We have appealed repeatedly in recent days for a cease-fire between the contending forces of the Dominican Republic in the interests of all Dominicans and foreigners alike.
I repeat this urgent appeal again tonight. The Council of the OAS has been advised of the situation by the Dominican Ambassador and the Council will be kept fully informed.
"
Donald Trump,"So thank you very much. We have a very important briefing being done by Homeland, and Pete Gaynor at FEMA, and some other great officials, including, of course, our Vice President, who has done such a terrific job -- Mike Pence.
And if we might, I think we'll start maybe with Pete, and you can tell us where we are, where we're going, and what kind of season we're going to have with respect to hurricanes.
Okay, sure. Go ahead.
What makes you think that those numbers would be correct? Very much of a projection, right?
So you think we could have a slightly enhanced hurricane season. That's just what we want. Let's see. Hopefully, that won't be the case, but we'll see.
Pete, would you like to say something? I think FEMA has been incredible. What they've done in terms of COVID, the hospitals, and all of the work you've done. What do you -- what do you think about the upcoming season? Are you ready?
So without COVID, you would have been pretty much on average?
Big difference.
That's a big difference in terms of preparedness. All right, great. Really good job.
A big percentage of that money last year went to Puerto Rico too, didn't it?
A lot of money went to Puerto Rico.
Wilbur, go ahead, please.
Okay. Thank you, Wilbur. Good job you're doing.
Mike, please.
Right.
We're always ready. Good. Thank you, Mike.
Chad.
And while Chad is here, maybe we'll talk about Mexico and the border. We are setting records on the border, in terms of low numbers. Very few people are getting in. And when they are in, we take them immediately out. And we're using emergency powers.
Mexico is having a very, very hard time, as you know, with COVID, especially along the border --
-- with Tijuana and various places along the border. And fortunately, we have brand-new wall along there, and the wall is saving us.
We're up to almost 200 miles of wall. We'll have, by end of the year, close to 400. By early next year, we'll be close to 500 miles. And wherever we have the wall, it's like not a problem. It just ceases -- virtually ceases as a problem. What a difference it's made.
So we're up to almost 200 miles. Mexico does have some great, great, big problems with COVID. You read about it this morning: They're at their record number. They had a very high number. Even if you look worldwide, it's a very high number.
Sadly, the area along our border is the highest -- their highest percentage of cases and problems. And we are not letting people into our country. So I want you to know that.
Brazil now -- we have the ban on. The ban has been put on, and it's a very strong ban, except we do have Americans that we have to allow -- like I did with the China ban, we do have to allow people to come back into the country. We can't be that tough, where we don't allow United States citizens to come back in. But they come back in under a very strict -- whether it's a quarantine or not, we test them and we go through a process.
You may want to tell them a little bit about that, please.
And we're sending hundreds of ventilators to Mexico. I spoke with the President, and we're helping them with the ventilators. And we're also dealing with Brazil with ventilators and other things. We try to help Brazil as much as we can.
And so we're -- you know, we -- great relationships, but they're very high -- high numbers. Mexico has high numbers. Brazil has very, very high numbers. So it's a -- it's a very sad situation. It should've never happened. China should have stopped it at the source, but they didn't do that.
So great numbers along the border -- really record-low numbers. And if somebody does cross, we bring them out and bring them back to where they came from. Okay?
We'll be giving another press conference in about a half an hour in a subject very dear to your heart, and you know what that subject is. And tomorrow, we're going to be having a press conference on China. So we'll be making certain decisions and we'll be discussing them tomorrow.
So I'll see you folks in 20 minutes. Okay? Thank you all very much.
Very close. We're going to be at that number. We could even be higher than that number. But you have to understand we were stopped for a long time with the Democrats. They didn't want -- they want open borders. They want people to flow into our country.
And all of a sudden you stopped hearing that a little bit because they realized that we were right. I was right. And we have a very strong border. We have a very powerful southern border.
And with all of the delays -- yeah, we're going to have, I would say, close to 400 mil- -- 400 miles by the end of this year. And, shortly thereafter, we'll have over 500 miles of border wall -- okay? -- which is the number that I said. That's the number, as you know -- consistently -- that's the number. Anything around the 500 mark was about the number we wanted to be. And I think we're going to go up to 536, but let's say 500.
And every place where we have the wall, we have no trouble whatsoever, other than if it's in the end, where they can go this way. But we have good guard -- and, frankly, Mexico has really helped us. They have 26,000 soldiers right now on the border doing -- doing that for us and for them. But we have 26,000 Mexican soldiers right now at the border not allowing people to come in. Okay? Good.
I'm going to be signing an executive order in 30 minutes or less. Okay?
Thank you very much.

Anna Soubry,"This morning, Tata Steel announced plans to make over 1,000 redundancies across its UK strip business as part of its continuing restructuring plans. The proposals involve 750 job losses at Port Talbot, 200 redundancies in support functions at Llanwern, and 100 redundancies at steel mills in Trostre, Corby and Hartlepool. This will be a difficult time for all the workers and their families, and our thoughts must be with them. Our immediate focus will be on helping any workers who lose their jobs back into employment as quickly as possible. We will also continue to support the steel industry.
Given the United Kingdom’s devolution settlement, much of the support that can be offered in south Wales, both to the workers and to Tata Steel, will come from the Welsh government, but the UK government want to ensure that Port Talbot has a commercial and sustainable future. It is encouraging that the Welsh government are to launch a taskforce this week – I believe that it is to meet for the first time on Wednesday – to support those affected by today’s announcement. We have offered our support to the chair of the taskforce, Edwina Hart, and we will continue to work with the Welsh government. I welcome the commitment that the First Minister made today to work closely with the UK government. I am confident that the Welsh government will accede to our request to play a full part in the taskforce. I can assure hon. members that we are also working closely with the Secretary of State for Wales – he is there today, which is why he is not in the House.
It is important to remember that the fundamental problem facing our steel industry is the fall in world prices, caused by the over-production and under-consumption of steel. We know, for example, that the price of slab has almost halved over the past 12 months, and that Tata has been losing £1 million a day as a result of the slump in prices. All that the industry has asked for – this includes the unions – is a level playing field, and that is what we are achieving. The government have been working closely with Tata to do all we can to ensure a sustainable future for Tata Steel in the United Kingdom, both at Port Talbot and at Scunthorpe. We have offered our assistance to Tata as it seeks to find a buyer for its long products division. It is encouraging that it has announced that Greybull Capital is its preferred bidder. We remain in close contact with Tata as its commercial negotiations continue. The government stand ready to play our part to help secure Scunthorpe’s long-term future.
Returning to today’s announcement, the same offer is there for Port Talbot. Tata is currently working with consultants to develop a plan to address the near-term competitiveness of its business at Port Talbot. We and the Welsh government are in regular dialogue with Tata. This dialogue includes my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary, as well as my officials and, of course, me. While the future of Port Talbot must be commercially led, we will help where we can within the parameters of state aid rules. I want to make it absolutely clear that, in the words of the Prime Minister, we are unequivocal in saying that steel is a vital industry. This government are determined that steel is produced not just at Scunthorpe but at Port Talbot, and that it has a sustainable future.
As I say, we are creating the level playing field that the industry has asked of us. It set out 5 asks when we had our steel summit back at the end of last year. We have already paid about £60 million to the steel industry to help to mitigate the costs of existing energy policies. The new state approval will enable us now to extend the scope of compensation. It will go live tomorrow, enabling steel and other energy-intensive industries to apply. That will save the steel industry about £100 million over the financial year – roughly 30% of its energy bills – but we are going to go even further and exempt EIIs from most of these costs. Our support for these industries will save them hundreds of millions of pounds over the next 5 years.
The sector asked for flexibility over EU emissions regulations, and that is exactly what we have secured. Derogations for Port Talbot have already been agreed by Natural Resources Wales. The Environment Agency has accepted Tata Steel’s proposals for derogations for improving emissions from Scunthorpe, subject to a current public consultation. Once approved, this will give it a further 6 years to improve emission levels from the coke ovens. Both of Tata Steel’s major power plants have been included in the UK transitional plan that the UK has submitted to the European Union. This gives it until June 2020 – a further 4 years – to meet the emission requirements. These actions will save the industry millions of pounds.
We have further updated and published, specifically and properly, new guidance about procurement, of which mention was made during Defence questions. We are the first country in the European Union to take advantage of and implement these new flexibilities, so social impact, job impact and staff safety can now be taken into account. In short, there is no excuse not to, and every reason to, buy British steel. Having just met the Aluminium Federation, I want to make it clear and put it on the record that those procurement rules include aluminium.
I have heard it said that the government have blocked the reform of trade defence investigation, but they have not. I can assure the House that the government have been acting decisively to safeguard the United Kingdom’s steel interests in Europe. In July last year, and again in November, we voted in favour of anti-dumping measures on certain steel imports. The United Kingdom lobbied successfully in support of industry calls for an investigation into imports of reinforcing steel bar. I hope that we will have an announcement soon on the result of those actions under the excellent leadership of the Business Secretary. The European Commission has taken this forward swiftly, including responding quickly to industry requests to register imports. The United Kingdom secured an extraordinary meeting of the EU’s Competitiveness Council and agreed faster action. Next month I will return to follow that up at a stakeholder conference where I will push for further progress.
The review of business rates in England will conclude this year. Of course, the Welsh government, because this is devolved, have responsibility for business rates in Port Talbot and other parts of Tata’s workings in Wales.
We have seen today that the steel industry remains subject to unprecedented global pressures. While the immediate causes of these are beyond the government’s control, I can assure the House that we continue to do all we can to help this industry, and we will stand by all the workers who face redundancy in south Wales and other parts of the United Kingdom.

Donald Trump,"At ease. Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. And this is officially, for you, most of you know, the Rose Garden. Very special. Very, very special place. Today is a day of celebration, so relax and have a good time.
I have no higher honor as President than to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. And I truly have no greater pleasure than to award the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, for the first time in 21 years, to the Army Black Knights. Congratulations.
A special thanks to West Point Superintendent, Lieutenant General Bob Caslen. Where's Bob? Where's Bob? Come here, Bob. How do you like it, Bob? Bob Caslen. You know -- do you remember our meeting? Right?
That was a good meeting, right?
But I'm glad you did what you did. And you have done a fantastic job. Thank you, Bob.
I made the right choice with you. General, you're a great leader -- and a legendary institution that has been a source of pride and strength for our country for more than two centuries.
I'd like to welcome two West Point grads serving in my administration who are here today to celebrate the Black Knights history and, really, that historic victory: Secretary of the Army Mark Esper. Where is Mark? Mark. Mark. Mark? How are you, Mark? Doing a great job. And a man that has gotten more publicity than me, lately, our new Secretary of State –- first in his class at West Point. Is that a true story?
Come on, tell me, is that true?
Mike Pompeo. And he's been busy. General, he's been very busy. He's been a busy guy. How's everything going? Good? I think better than people even understand. Right? Good. Good job, Mike.
A warm welcome to Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan. Patrick, thank you very much. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you. Thank you, General.
Finally, and most importantly, welcome to Coach Jeff Monken. See? They say, most important. Today is a very important day. He's a great coach. And the 2017 Commander-in-Chief's Trophy-winning team, the Army Black Knights. That really is something very special. Coach, thank you very much. What a job. Right? He could get a little expensive here. Good job, Coach.
I don't know. But he said he loves his team coming back, so you have another good season planned. I know that. As the team had an amazing season, capping it off with a come-from-behind victory at the Armed Forces Bowl -- a game I watched, and that was a very exciting game.
That was old-fashioned football. Everybody had counted you out, but you refused to give up. You scored 21 points in the fourth quarter alone. Your victory gave Army its second 10-win season in the entire history of Army football. That's something.
Winning a bowl game is truly impressive, and you really -- shutting out Air Force -- and Air Force is a great football power and a great football school -- 21 to nothing. But we all know that your most important win was at the celebrated Army-Navy game. There is no game like that, I think, Coach. Right? That's something special.
On that snowy day you fought hard, you came from behind, and beat Navy for the second season in a row; the first time that it's happened in over two decades. That's what you call a job well done. Amazing. Really amazing.
In that most crucial game of the year, you made the entire U.S. Army proud, and you made the country proud. Early in the third quarter, Navy was up 10 to 7 when their quarterback started racing down the field. One of your team captains, John Voit -- no relation to Jon Voight. He wouldn't be too good of a football player, but he's good at other things. Right? John Voit -- where's John?
Come on over here, John. Big guy. I don't know. Well, so you went down and you stopped him with a shoestring tackle. What a play, John. So if he doesn't make that shoestring tackle, what happens, Coach?
You're probably not standing here right now, Coach. Thank you, man.
That was great. That stop saved the game for Army and put all of you in the record books. It's what it's done. You're in the record books. Incredible season.
Then there's your great Army quarterback that we all know, co-captain Ahmad Bradshaw. Ahmad. I don't know, Ahmad. I think you'd rather be doing what you're doing, and you're doing an unbelievable job. What a great game you had.
You became Army's all-time, single-season rushing leader with 1,746 yards. That's a lot of yards. That's all-time. You didn't just break the Army record, Ahmad; you broke the rushing record for every single service academy ever. So that is a tremendous achievement. Thank you.
And I understand that one of the toughest moments of the year came with only two games left in the season -- I hate to bring this up, but we have to, Coach -- when the University of North Texas scored a winning field goal in the last seconds of the game. The final score was a heartbreaking 52-49.
Back in the locker room, Coach Monken looked every player -- every single one of them -- in the eye. And with great inspiration he asked, ""Do you want to win with me?"""" Do you want to win with me? Right
They responded. Finally, the Coach declared, ""We are not losing another game this year. We're going to outwork
Each of you is part of a great tradition of Army football excellence that goes back many generations. And it's true excellence. Here today is one of the great examples of that tradition, a key member of the legendary 1958 team. Exactly 60 years ago, Army went totally undefeated. That's pretty good, General. Right? Good team.
I don't know. Do you think they could have beaten you guys? I don't know.
They might have been smaller and not as fast. Where's Bob? Where is Bob? Come here, Bob. Hey, Bob. Come here, Bob. He's a big guy. Come on up here, Bob. Come on up.
Still looks good. They keep them good at West Point -- right, Mike? Stand up here with us. General, is he allowed to stand with you? I don't know. Should we let him stand up here?
Should we let him stand up here, fellas?
He's in the hall of fame, is right. To all of the players here today, West Point adopted each one of you into its history, traditions, and values. The Corps gave you a fundamental piece of who you are and who you will always be.
You have given back to the Corps with dedication and teamwork, with every effort to achieve physical and academic excellence, with your embrace of those three most hallowed words: duty, honor, country.
When each of you stepped out on the field, you had the pride of knowing that you played for Army. You won for Army. And very soon, you will be officers and leaders in that incredible group of heroes called the United States Army. And they really are a group of heroes. If you look at the world, by the way, we are respected again. Is that right, General? We are respected again --
-- at the highest level. You can see what's going on. You see a big difference. There's a big, big difference. And fellas, we just got approved $700 billion, this year; $716 billion for next year. And that's for you and the Armed Forces. And we've never h
The lessons you've learned on what General Douglas MacArthur called ""the fields of friendly strife
You will be part of the five proud branches of the United States Armed Forces -- Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and the Coast Guard. And we're actually thinking of a sixth, and that would be the Space Force. Does that make sense? The Space Force, General. You probably haven't even heard that. I'm just telling you now. This is perhaps -- because we're getting very big in space, both militarily and for other reasons, and we are seriously thinking of the Space Force.
And you'll join the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known. You will keep us safe. You will keep us strong. You will keep us free.
And thank you for your service -- and go Army. I'll be watching you, Coach. I'll be watching you next year. I really believe that, from what I'm hearing, this team could go on and have another incredible season. You are a special group of people, and it's an honor to have you at the White House. Thank you very much, Coach. Please, say a few words.
Thank you, everybody.
"
Chris Huhne,"Conference, there is a Tory and Labour conspiracy on crime.
Both are guilty of putting forward measures to tackle crime that are ineffective or even counter-productive.
These parties are not tough on crime. They are soft on hard thinking and tough choices. Just as our party has changed the public debate on climate change, we need to change the debate on crime and punishment.
We need a new consensus on what works, not what titillates the tabloids.
We need common sense not sensationalism. That’s why we proposed on Sunday a National Crime Reduction Agency to report on the evidence of what works in justice and policing as thoroughly as we assess medicines in the health service.
Instead, we now have a crime debate totally removed from reality.
Take an example in July. A Labour Home Secretary announced she would march young offenders into hospital to see the consequences of violence. She ignored the evidence from the United States that such programmes do not cut crime, but put it up. Four days later, she ditched the idea.
Or take David Cameron. He knows that you can get four years in jail for just carrying a knife, but he thinks that judges tiptoe around knife crime. So he wants to send every knife carrier to prison automatically.
Just a small problem. If he did, the prison population would nearly quadruple. The basic rate of income tax would go up by a penny in the pound.
Oh, and another problem. The evidence shows it wouldn’t work.
What works is visible policing to reassure people they do not need to carry a knife. Intelligence led stop and search of hot spots to catch knife carriers. Working with the local community to gather leads and encourage witnesses. Telling it how it is in schools and colleges. Taking back control of the streets.
But Labour and the Tories are addicted to punishment posturing, and that means legislative diarrhoea as a substitute for enforcing the law that we have. In their first decade in government, Labour’s new legislation takes the same amount of shelf space as 200 copies of War and Peace.
And it is twice as heavy as John Prescott. Labour has introduced 3,600 new criminal offences since 1997 even though nearly every offence that people care about has been illegal for years.
My favourite is a new offence which shows ministers getting really tough. You will be relieved to hear that it is now against the law to set off nuclear explosions.
Labour and the Tories have pretended that prison is the most effective way of deterring crime. They say that if someone is locked up, they cannot offend. But that ignores the fact that prisoners leave when they serve their time.
The whole point of prison ought to be to stop people reoffending. But if you put a young man into prison for the first time, there is a 92 per cent chance he will offend again. Our prisons are colleges of crime.
If prison works so well, why has crime gone down in Denmark while the number of prisoners has gone down? Why has crime fallen in Canada when the prison population is the same? The Government’s own top-notch research found no evidence that tougher penalties deterred crime.
Let’s be clear. We need prison for serious offenders and for serial offences. But we need reformed prisons that educate, occupy and prepare prisoners for life outside.
There’s another reason why prison does not work well. It is because so few people are caught. For every hundred crimes committed in Britain today, just one criminal will end up with a conviction in a court of law. That’s a 99 per cent chance of getting away with it. And if you don’t catch offenders, no amount of threatening punishments will work.
So if we want to cut crime, we should stop posturing about penalties because they are tough enough. The answer’s simple. Catch criminals to cut crime.
Yet Labour, like the Tories, has done the opposite of what works. The average prison sentence has gone up – that the ineffective bit that does not work. Meanwhile, the key factor that does work – the detection rate for crime – has fallen by nearly a fifth since the end of the eighties.
If the prison population was still the same as when crime peaked in 1996, there would be enough cash for 25,000 extra police officers. If the ID card scheme were scrapped, we could hire a further 10,000 police. That’s 35,000 extra police officers – a quarter extra – on the streets catching criminals and cutting crime.
Of course, more does not always mean better. Year after year, Labour and the Tories have ducked the tough choices on police reform. Sheehy, Flanagan, HM Inspectors’ reports. All have come and gone.
We need more police, but better policing too. Detection rates even for serious offences vary widely. For violent crime, just a third of recorded offences are detected in London compared with two thirds in North Yorkshire.
Spreading best practice would mean more detection. And more detection would mean less crime. Detection works.
That is why police performance matters. Poor performance is not tackled strongly enough. A senior police officer who has lost motivation is usually left alone. That’s not good for morale. It is not good for ambitious young officers to see deadwood prosper. The force needs to be able properly to reward not just time served, but effort, talent and skills.
Worst of all, police pay has become a political football. Police officers cannot by law strike. They suffer the same squeeze on pay and costs as the rest of us, but they cannot get a second job without their Chief Constable’s permission. In exchange for those restrictions, ministers must accept the recommendations of the independent police pay tribunal. Police need a pay system which is fair, independent and respected.
And we need local policing. The Tories and Labour have set central targets that meddle, but do not deliver. They have distorted local priorities. By awarding the same points for minor and serious crimes, they have sucked thousands unnecessarily into the criminal justice system.
Central targets mean wasted effort and resources chasing the wrong priorities, which is why they must go. We need local accountability to local people with the powers to set local priorities. If local people do not like the results, they can get rid of the decision-makers.
If the Liberal Democrats did not exist, all there would be on crime and justice from the Tories and Labour would be show-boating and grand-standing.
And if the Liberal Democrats did not exist, who would stand up for civil liberties? Not the so-called liberal Conservatives, who just this summer have called for tougher bail conditions, automatic sentences for knife-carrying, more prisons, and the removal of checks on police surveillance. I just hope the Conservatives can still be relied upon to vote against more detention without trial or ID cards. Goodbye David Davis, it was nice knowing you.
And if the Liberal Democrats did not exist, who would rebuild our fading democracy? Not David Cameron, who has gone strangely quiet on constitutional change. I’ve got a challenge for you David, Do you even stand by your commitment in your leadership campaign to fixed term parliaments?
And if the Liberal Democrats did not exist, who would stand up for our children’s future in a time of climate change? Not the green Tories. The first thing Boris Johnson did when he became London’s mayor was ditch green taxes on the biggest cars. As for George Osborne, he has already ditched green taxes in favour of cutting petrol taxes. Not the planet’s champion, but the gas guzzler’s friend.
And if the Liberal Democrats did not exist, who would stand up for fairness? Not Labour, who thought it was a good idea to increase income tax on the worst off to give better-off taxpayers a cut. And not the Conservatives either, whatever they now pretend. David Cameron and George Osborne both abstained on Labour’s budget. Remember their first tax cut promise? Abolishing stamp duty on share dealing for their friends in the City. And their second was a cut in inheritance tax for households with £2 million.
We are now told that David Cameron and George Osborne were idealistic young people who cared about fairness. Perhaps they agonised over their options as they adjusted their fancy tailcoats – mirror, mirror on the wall, which party is the fairest of them all? Tory, Lib Dem or Labour?
Well, when young David and young George were wondering which party to join, we had a Conservative government. For eighteen years. And during that period the poor got poorer and the rich got richer, and the gap got wider. And the reason was not some force of nature, but Tory policy decisions that were hard-nosed, sharp-eyed and mean-minded.
A Tory decision to scrap the link between pensions and earnings. Result? More pensioner poverty.
A Tory decision to scrap the uprating of out of work and in work benefits. Result? More working poverty.
A Tory decision to scrap the uprating of child benefit. Result? More child poverty.
These chaps are not stupid, so why do they think we were born yesterday?
George Osborne will go fair when George Bush goes green. Fairness will be a Tory value when hell freezes over, Notting Hill becomes a workers’ republic, and the Bullingdon club affiliates to the Socialist International.
I’ve got news for David Cameron. You don’t make society fairer by hoping for it, or by talking about it. You can only make society fairer by helping the poor and the powerless, and that means giving them more money and more power over their own lives.
And I’ve got a challenge for David Cameron. Name a single period of Conservative government when Britain has become more equal. Name a single Conservative measure which even helped.
David Cameron, like Tony Blair, wants to be all things to all people. Tories would have us believe they are the party of the environment, and of owners of big cars. Of  traditional values, and of change. Of equality, and of lower taxes on the best off. Of liberty, and of removing checks on police surveillance. Of European membership for Georgia, and of pulling out of Europe’s social chapter for us. If politics is about making tough choices, the Tory party is about ducking hard decisions. A party which has every priority is a party that has none. A party with no heart, no core values and no direction.
There’s only one party committed to the environment, and always has been. Only one party committed to civil liberties, and always was. Only one party committed to fairness. Only one party committed to handing power back to the people. And only one party for building a world based on the rule of law not the law of the jungle.
Conference, Labour can’t deliver the change that our nation needs. The Conservatives won’t. Only the Liberal Democrats will.

Barack Obama,"Hello Springfield! ...Look at all of you. Look at all of you. Goodness. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Giving all praise and honor to God for bringing us here today. Thank you so much. I am -- I am so grateful to see all of you. You guys are still cheering back there.
Let me -- Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today. I know it's a little chilly -- but I'm fired up. You know, we all made this journey for a reason. It's humbling to see a crowd like this, but in my heart I know you didn't just come here for me. You...came here because you believe in what this country can be. In the face of war, you believe there can be peace. In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope. In the face of a politics that shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe that we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings. I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature, that the decisions to close a steel mill was made by distant executives, that the lack of textbooks and computers in a school could be traced to skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away, and that when a child turns to violence -- I came to realize that -- there's a hole in that boy's heart that no government alone can fill.
It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education that I ever had, and where I learned the meaning of my Christian faith.After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need. I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate. It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.It -- It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge -- farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard. I made lasting friendships here, friends that I see here in the audience today.It was here -- It was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable; that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken; that's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need; that's why we made the tax system right here in Springfield more fair and just for working families; and that's why we passed ethics reform that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East, and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people -- where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a house divided to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still live, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America.
Now -- Now, listen,I -- I... -- thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Look, I -- I...recognize that there is a certain presumptuousness in this, a certain audacity, to this announcement. I know that I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington. But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.The genius of our Founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed. And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before. In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an empire to its knees. In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free. In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty. We welcomed immigrants to our shores. We opened railroads to the west. We landed a man on the moon. And we heard a King's call to let ""justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.""
Now look --
Okay. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Look, look, we have made some progress already. I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reforms since Watergate.But Washington has a long way to go, and it won't be easy. That's why we'll have to set priorities. We'll have to make hard choices. And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes that we need, more money and programs alone will not get us to where we need to go. Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility -- for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
So let us begin. Let us begin this hard work together. Let us transform this nation.Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age. Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed. Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability. Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America. We can do that.
Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil. We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars. We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases. We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world. Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got. Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore; we can work together to keep our country safe. I've worked with the Republican SenatorDick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest weapons. We can work together to track down terrorists with a stronger military. We can tighten the net around their finances. We can improve our intelligence capabilities and finally get homeland security right. But let's also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will only come by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions of people around the globe.
We can do those things.
But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq. Most of you know -- Most of you know that I opposed this war from the start. I thought it was a tragic mistake. Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been. America, it is time to start bringing our troops home. It's time -- It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war. That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008. Let the Iraqis know -- Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.And there's one other thing that it's not too late to get right about this war, and that is the homecoming of the men and women, our veterans, who have sacrificed the most. Let us honor their courage by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love. Let us be the generation that begins that work.
I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things. I understand the skepticism. After all, every four years, candidates from both Parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different. All of us running for President will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead this country. But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.That's why this campaign can't only be about me. It must be about us. It must be about what we can do together. This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams. It will take your time, your energy, and your advice to push us forward when we're doing right, and let us know when we're not. This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.By ourselves, this change will not happen. Divided, we are bound to fail.But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
He tells us that there is power in words.
That is our purpose here today.That is why I am in this race -- not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.I want -- I want to win that next battle -- for justice and opportunity.I want to win that next battle -- for better schools, and better jobs, and better health care for all.I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.And if you will join with me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, the future of endless possibility stretching out before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fears, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I am ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you -- today.
Together we can finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
Thank you very much everybody -- let's get to work! I love you. Thank you.

George Bush,"Just 2 hours ago, allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait. These attacks continue as I speak. Ground forces are not engaged.
This conflict started August 2d when the dictator of Iraq invaded a small and helpless neighbor. Kuwait -- a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations -- was crushed; its people, brutalized. Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait. Tonight, the battle has been joined.
This military action, taken in accord with United Nations resolutions and with the consent of the United States Congress, follows months of constant and virtually endless diplomatic activity on the part of the United Nations, the United States, and many, many other countries. Arab leaders sought what became known as an Arab solution, only to conclude that Saddam Hussein was unwilling to leave Kuwait. Others traveled to Baghdad in a variety of efforts to restore peace and justice. Our Secretary of State, James Baker, held an historic meeting in Geneva, only to be totally rebuffed. This past weekend, in a last-ditch effort, the Secretary-General of the United Nations went to the Middle East with peace in his heart -- his second such mission. And he came back from Baghdad with no progress at all in getting Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait.
Now the 28 countries with forces in the Gulf area have exhausted all reasonable efforts to reach a peaceful resolution -- have no choice but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force. We will not fail.
As I report to you, air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq. We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential. We will also destroy his chemical weapons facilities. Much of Saddam's artillery and tanks will be destroyed. Our operations are designed to best protect the lives of all the coalition forces by targeting Saddam's vast military arsenal. Initial reports from General Schwarzkopf are that our operations are proceeding according to plan.
Our objectives are clear: Saddam Hussein's forces will leave Kuwait. The legitimate government of Kuwait will be restored to its rightful place, and Kuwait will once again be free. Iraq will eventually comply with all relevant United Nations resolutions, and then, when peace is restored, it is our hope that Iraq will live as a peaceful and cooperative member of the family of nations, thus enhancing the security and stability of the Gulf.
Some may ask: Why act now? Why not wait? The answer is clear: The world could wait no longer. Sanctions, though having some effect, showed no signs of accomplishing their objective. Sanctions were tried for well over 5 months, and we and our allies concluded that sanctions alone would not force Saddam from Kuwait.
While the world waited, Saddam Hussein systematically raped, pillaged, and plundered a tiny nation, no threat to his own. He subjected the people of Kuwait to unspeakable atrocities -- and among those maimed and murdered, innocent children.
While the world waited, Saddam sought to add to the chemical weapons arsenal he now possesses, an infinitely more dangerous weapon of mass destruction -- a nuclear weapon. And while the world waited, while the world talked peace and withdrawal, Saddam Hussein dug in and moved massive forces into Kuwait.
While the world waited, while Saddam stalled, more damage was being done to the fragile economies of the Third World, emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, to the entire world, including to our own economy.
The United States, together with the United Nations, exhausted every means at our disposal to bring this crisis to a peaceful end. However, Saddam clearly felt that by stalling and threatening and defying the United Nations, he could weaken the forces arrayed against him.
While the world waited, Saddam Hussein met every overture of peace with open contempt. While the world prayed for peace, Saddam prepared for war.
I had hoped that when the United States Congress, in historic debate, took its resolute action, Saddam would realize he could not prevail and would move out of Kuwait in accord with the United Nation resolutions. He did not do that. Instead, he remained intransigent, certain that time was on his side.
Saddam was warned over and over again to comply with the will of the United Nations: Leave Kuwait, or be driven out. Saddam has arrogantly rejected all warnings. Instead, he tried to make this a dispute between Iraq and the United States of America.
Well, he failed. Tonight, 28 nations -- countries from 5 continents, Europe and Asia, Africa, and the Arab League -- have forces in the Gulf area standing shoulder to shoulder against Saddam Hussein. These countries had hoped the use of force could be avoided. Regrettably, we now believe that only force will make him leave.
Prior to ordering our forces into battle, I instructed our military commanders to take every necessary step to prevail as quickly as possible, and with the greatest degree of protection possible for American and allied service men and women. I've told the American people before that this will not be another Vietnam, and I repeat this here tonight. Our troops will have the best possible support in the entire world, and they will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back. I'm hopeful that this fighting will not go on for long and that casualties will be held to an absolute minimum.
This is an historic moment. We have in this past year made great progress in ending the long era of conflict and cold war. We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order -- a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations. When we are successful -- and we will be -- we have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U. N.'s founders.
We have no argument with the people of Iraq. Indeed, for the innocents caught in this conflict, I pray for their safety. Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq. It is the liberation of Kuwait. It is my hope that somehow the Iraqi people can, even now, convince their dictator that he must lay down his arms, leave Kuwait, and let Iraq itself rejoin the family of peace-loving nations.
Thomas Paine wrote many years ago: ""These are the times that try men's souls."" Those well-known words are so very true today. But even as planes of the multinational forces attack Iraq, I prefer to think of peace, not war. I am convinced not only that we will prevail but that out of the horror of combat will come the recognition that no nation can stand against a world united, no nation will be permitted to brutally assault its neighbor.
No President can easily commit our sons and daughters to war. They are the Nation's finest. Ours is an all-volunteer force, magnificently trained, highly motivated. The troops know why they're there. And listen to what they say, for they've said it better than any President or Prime Minister ever could.
Listen to Hollywood Huddleston, Marine lance corporal. He says, ""Let's free these people, so we can go home and be free again."" And he's right. The terrible crimes and tortures committed by Saddam's henchmen against the innocent people of Kuwait are an affront to mankind and a challenge to the freedom of all.
Listen to one of our great officers out there, Marine Lieutenant General Walter Boomer. He said: ""There are things worth fighting for. A world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go unchecked isn't the kind of world we're going to want to live in.""
Listen to Master Sergeant J. P. Kendall of the 82d Airborne: ""We're here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas. What we're doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next 100 years. It's better to deal with this guy now than 5 years from now.""
And finally, we should all sit up and listen to Jackie Jones, an Army lieutenant, when she says, ""If we let him get away with this, who knows what's going to be next?""
I have called upon Hollywood and Walter and J. P. and Jackie and all their courageous comrades-in-arms to do what must be done. Tonight, America and the world are deeply grateful to them and to their families. And let me say to everyone listening or watching tonight: When the troops we've sent in finish their work, I am determined to bring them home as soon as possible.
Tonight, as our forces fight, they and their families are in our prayers. May God bless each and every one of them, and the coalition forces at our side in the Gulf, and may He continue to bless our nation, the United States of America.

Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. We have a highly respected person with us, the President of Poland, and the highest representatives of Poland. And we’ve had some tremendous discussions having to do with trade and military and lots of other things. And they continue. Secretary Perry is discussing a very, very big transaction with Poland.
One of the biggest. And we are very prepared to go forward with that, Rick, as you know. And it will be very, very important for both nations, maybe in particular for your nation. And I think you’re right in what you’re doing. I’d like to ask Secretary Pompeo maybe to say a few words. I know you’re dealing very well and successfully with your representative from Poland.
Good. Thank you, Mike. And, Wilbur, do you have anything to say?
I think a deficit.
Right.
Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary?
It's true. Buy American.
It's true. We appreciate it.
Good. Thank you. And I see our ambassador. She's doing a good job, I'll bet. I've known Georgette for a long time.
Georgette? How's it going?
Thank you. Keep up the good work, Georgette.
Rick Perry?
Well, Rick, Poland is a very, very large purchaser now of the LNG, and they are getting it by the billions, actually. We're signing contracts for billions and billions of dollars. And that’s great. And we have a lot of it. We have a lot of it. So we very much appreciate it. And I see our great Secretary of Homeland Security.
Now, why aren’t you on the Mexican border today.
Good. And how are we doing on the other border -- that southern border that we talk about all the time?
And if we had the Democrats, we could solve the problem in 15 minutes with the loopholes and the asylum, right?
Right. I know you did. And you did it well. John Bolton, please.
Okay. Oh, good. Mr. President, please.
You never know. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
It'll be great.
We'll talk about that later.

Joe Biden,"Hello, NALEO. How are you? Good to see you again, Arturo. I want to say a special hi to my good friend, and he is my good friend, Secretary Daley. Billy, it’s been a long time, pal. Glad to see you looking so well. I look forward to seeing you pretty soon. I’m honored to be with you all today, and I want to start by thanking Arturo for this opportunity to share my vision for Latinos in our country. If I have the honor of being elected president, I want to thank you for your opening remarks, and I’m going to need you if I get elected. Not just getting elected, if I get elected.
Throughout our decades and your decades, I think I go way back. I may have been at that 39 years ago when you started, decades leading NALEO Education Fund. We’ve seen a lot of ups and downs in the Latino community, but none more stark than the last three and a half years. Donald Trump and his administration have pursued an all out assault. That’s how I phrase it, assault on Latino communities, from the moment he came down that golden escalator saying he was going to go after those Mexicans rapists. Remember? That’s how he started his campaign. It started the moment he announced his presidency, fanning the flames of fear and racism against Latinos.
The flames of fear and racism against Latinos. It’s baked into every aspect of how he’s governed. And this week was an especially poignant reminder of the terrible consequence, allowing that kind of hate to grow, to grow unchecked. You know, I thought we could defeat hate, but and it only hides under the rocks. And when a president breathes oxygen in, it comes out roaring out.
On Monday, we marked the one year anniversary of the tragic mass shooting in El Paso, where a gunman explicitly sought to target Latinos and 23 beautiful lives were stolen from us and their families. I know what it’s like to lose a child. And I know what it was like to lose a wife. It is awful. It is starkly. I shouldn’t get started. You know, the stakes of Trump’s irresponsible policies of division and hate that he promotes is real. These are life and death decisions. Whether it’s repeated attacks on Dreamers or his campaign of terror against immigrant communities, whether it’s his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, which is outrageous or his repeated failures to make sure essential workers have the personal protective equipment they need. Donald Trump has failed the Latino community time and time again.
So the question you ask Arturo, how are we going to make real a better life for Latinos? That’s the key question, and the future of our country literally depends on how we answer it. That’s how important it is. Because here’s the God’s honest truth, the future success that our country are going to depend on our ability to make sure Latinos have opportunities and the tools to succeed. Latino is among the fastest growing population in the United States. Already one quarter of our school children, one quarter of our school children are Latino. How in God’s name can we have a strong and thriving Republic if we don’t fully deal Latinos into every aspect of American life? These kids are not someone else’s kids, they’re our kids. The kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft.
That’s why earlier this week I released my Latino agenda. Things I’ve been working on all along and you know about, but I put them all in one place. It’s a comprehensive plan for not just how we’re going to undo all the harms that the Trump administration has inflicted, but how we’re going to really make sure Latinos are included in our plans to build back and build back better. That means investing in Latino’s economics mobility, because that’s the best basis of it all, economic mobility. Everything from making sure Latino small business owners can access capital to making it easy for Latino families to buy a home to build intergenerational wealth. How did every other middle class person do it when they came here? They were able to ultimately buy a home and build equity in the home and pass it on from generation to generation.
One of the four planks of my Build Back Better plan is about addressing racial inequities across the entire economy. It’s about breaking the cycle where in good times, Latino communities still lag behind. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest as you referenced, Arturo. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back and only get back to where they were at the beginning, which wasn’t a good place to begin with. We’re going to use every tool at our disposal to take on these inequities.
My Latino agenda also focused on any race based health disparities. Latinos were among the biggest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act with millions gaining insurance for the first time. The uninsured rate dropped from 32% to 19%, and my plan would bring it down to zero. That’s what an incredible win, it was a significant win for Latino community. But now in the midst of a pandemic, when almost 160,000 dead, those families lost part of their soul, part of their heart. Donald Trump is trying to strip people off their healthcare coverage in court in the middle of a pandemic. And Latinos are burying some of the heaviest burdens, go through the higher rates of infection and because Latinos disproportionately serve in caregiving roles on the frontline jobs and increase the risk of exposure and save other people. It’s unconscionable.
I’m going to protect Obamacare and build on it with a public option, so every single person can have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare. When it comes to fighting this pandemic, we have to be crystal clear. Everyone gets free access to testing and treatment. And when it’s available, a vaccine, everyone gets it. We have to fight this virus without regard to immigrant status. That’s the only way we’re going to beat this thing. And it’s only humane thing to do.
We’re also going to expand access to high-quality education and take on the racial inequities in our education system. That starts early. We are making sure high-quality pre-K is available to every child, three and four years old. Because the studies show that increases exponentially the prospects of success through the entire 12 years. It goes all the way through making sure post high school education is affordable for Latino students, ensuring public colleges and universities are tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year, doubling Pell Grants, $12,000, increasing funding for Hispanic serving institutions.
I started today by speaking about the tragedy in El Paso one year ago. We also know Latinos suffer every day from hate crimes and gun violence. It doesn’t always make national headlines. Under the Biden administration, we’re going to get weapons of war and high capacity magazines out of our communities. I’m going to take the fight directly to the NRA and hold gun manufacturers accountable for the damage they caused to Latino families. Finally, we’re going to restore our values as a nation of immigrants.
Trump fails to understand the basic truth of immigrants. That they’re the incredible source of our nation’s strength and they always have been. All the way back to the 1860s, when my Irish ancestors jumped on coffin ships in the Irish sea, not knowing where they are going, not knowing whether they’re going to make it to the shore all the way to today. There’s the reason we’ve been able to constantly renew and remake ourselves because we’ve been able to cherry pick the best of every culture. It takes courage to leave and come here from every continent, from every background. That’s why we’re who we are.
If I’m elected president, we’re going to immediately end Trump’s assault on the dignity of immigrant communities. We’re going to restore our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers, and those fleeing violence and persecution. My Lord, we’ve never made asylum seekers stay, seek asylum outside the United States of America. We’re going to stop the inhumane practice of separating children from their parents and work to reunite families. Look at all the families that are not reunited. We’re going to stop detaining people and definitely invest instead on case management programs to help ensure migrants get the support they need while they’re navigating the asylum process. It’s going to cost a lot of money, but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than building a wall. We’re going to restore a sensible enforcement priorities and stop terrorizing Latino communities.
The idea is you wait outside the 10 o’clock mass to grab someone from church. The anxiety for the children, the anxiety is overwhelming. It’s going to have a profound impact on a generation. We’re going to protect Dreamers and their families, and every single agreement that the Trump administration signed to turn local law enforcement and immigration officials. On day one, I’m going to send Congress a bill for immigration reform. We’ll focus on keeping families together. It’s about families, including providing a clear roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented alien and undocumented immigrants. Stop treating them the way they’re being treated. We’re going to live in enriching our communities every single day.
I know that’s a pretty big agenda, but this is a moment to get it done. The pandemic has lift the blinders off so many people in this country on who’s really essential to our economic strength. It’s not Wall Street bankers or CEOs. The middle class hardworking union members fighting for the rights of all workers, the folks in the Latino community who are busting their necks every day to keep the country running. And I believe, I really do believe we’re ready to close the respect gap, the dignity gap, the wage gap, the opportunity gap. So many Latino workers have suffered for so long.
You know my dad used to have an expression, he say, “Joey …” When he lost the job up in Scranton and we had to move down to Delaware and my dad never went to college. He was a graceful, good man. He used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about honor. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’” That’s what we’re going to do. Dignity, honor, treating people.
… Do, dignity, honor, treating people with dignity. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, and the full diversity of the Latino communities. Now, when I mean full diversity, unlike the African-American community and many other communities, you’re from everywhere. They’re from Europe, from the tip of South America, all the way to our border in Mexico and in the Caribbean. And different backgrounds. Different ethnicities, but all Latinos. We’re going to get a chance to do that if we win in November. It means we need everyone to get out and vote. I can’t do this without your help.
The path to victory in November is contingent upon Latino voters, particularly in those battleground states. I’m committed to speaking directly to the concerns of the Latino community and to mobilizing Latino voters. I have a significant staff. We’re trying to advertise on Latino stations, on Spanish-speaking stations. We need every single voter to sign up and get engaged in our campaign. We need you to get out and vote with your family and your friends. And make sure that people know how to register and how to vote safely during the pandemic.
We need to provide voters with more options, not fewer. Need to expand the option for participation. No excuse absentee ballots, when you get an absentee ballot just because you need one and want one. Increased in-person early voting. Have enough poll workers who can sanitize the machines and make sure we can socially distance and wearing masks. A lot of taking away meaningful opportunities to go in-person on election day. Our campaign is putting together the largest voter protection effort in the United States’ history because we know that we have to. We’ve already seen the impact that the pandemic has had on voting rights and voting during the primaries. We know. We know that voter suppression was alive and well in America before the public health crisis.
And make no mistake about it, as you pointed out, the Census is part of this, too. Everyone needs to be counted. Four former Census Bureau directors who have worked under nine presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, have called on the Senate and the administration to work to extend the deadline so we’d get an accurate count. Arturo, you mentioned the Voting Rights Act at the beginning. Well, today happens to be the 55th anniversary of its enactment. I worked like hell to strengthen and extend that Voting Act when I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Throughout my career, going back to 1975, back then, in 2013 though the Supreme Court came along and stripped the teeth out of the Voting Rights Act. It’s of the preclearance provision, they said was no longer necessary. I’m going to make sure it’s reinserted if the Congress doesn’t get it done in the remaining months of this Congress.
Just last year, 29 states, 29 states introduced or carried over bills that tried to make it harder for people to vote. This blatantly Unamerican. Our democracy, one person, one vote. That’s the very heart of who we are. And if the Senate, Republican Senate, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, don’t take up the bill, newly renamed in honor of my friend John Lewis to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full power, I will make it a priority on day one that we do that if I’m elected president.
So, I guess what I really want to say is just thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. And thank you again, Arturo, and everyone at NALEO for the work you’ve been doing. You make the country stronger. You make us all better. That’s not hyperbole. You make us all better, and the country is better, stronger, more prosperous, more decent, more honorable if we, in fact, reach out and embrace the largest population of immigrants in the United States and include them across the board. It’s a source of amazing strength for us. What I said, “I think because this COVID crisis and unemployment crisis” I think the American people are seeing that now. Least I hope that’s the case. I’m going to need your help if I’m elected to get all this done.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

Donald Trump,"Apart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice is the most important decision an American President can make. For this reason candidates for President owe the American people a specific list of individuals they consider for the United States Supreme Court. Four years ago, I announced my first list of highly qualified candidates and promise to fill Justice Scalia’s vacant seat from them from among those names. And just days after my inauguration, I kept that promise when I nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch. And as you know, he has been very spectacular. A year later, I nominated and the Senate confirmed another outstanding justice, Brett Kavanaugh. By the end of my first term, we will have confirmed a record number of federal judges, over 300, all of whom will faithfully uphold our Constitution as written. What has always made America exceptional is our reverence for the impartial rule of law.
People have come from all over the world to pursue the American dream based on this sacred principle. Equality under the law is the bedrock of our society. It is the principle that inspired American heroes to abolish slavery and end segregation, secure civil rights and build the most free and just nation in history. Unfortunately, there is a growing radical left movement that rejects the principle of equal treatment under the law. If this extreme movement is granted a majority on the Supreme Court, it will fundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress. Radical Justices will erase the Second Amendment, silence political speech, and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. They will give unelected bureaucrats the power to destroy millions of American jobs. They will remove the words “Under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance, they will unilaterally declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers. They will erase national borders, cripple police departments, and grant new protections to anarchists, rioters, violent criminals, and terrorists.
In the recent past, many of our most treasured freedoms, including religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms have been saved by a single vote on the United States Supreme Court. Our cherished rights are at risk, including the right to life and our great Second Amendment. Over the next four years, America’s President will choose hundreds of federal judges and in all likelihood, one, two, three, and even four Supreme Court Justices. The outcome of these decisions will determine whether we hold fast to our nation’s founding principles or whether they are lost forever. That is why today I am announcing 20 additions to my original list of candidates for the United States Supreme Court. Should there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public, including the original list and these 20 additions.
Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance. He must release a list of justices for people to properly make a decision as to how they will vote. It is very important that he do so. My original list of potential justices include many of our nation’s brightest legal minds, such as Bill Pryor, Amy Coney Barrett, and Thomas Hardiman, outstanding people. Like those distinguished individuals, the 20 additions I am announcing today would be jurors in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Aledo.
Their names are as follows: Bridget Bady of Arizona, Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Daniel Cameron of Kentucky, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Paul Clement of Virginia, Former Solicitor General of the United States. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Stewart Kyle Duncan of Louisiana, Judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Steven Engel of the District of Columbia, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice. Noel Francesco, former Solicitor General of the United States. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. James Hoe of Texas, Judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Gregory Kattsis of Virginia, Judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. Barbara Lagoa of Florida, Judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Christopher Landau of Maryland, United States ambassador to Mexico. Carlos Muniz of Florida, Justice on the Supreme Court of Florida. Martha Packold of Illinois, Judge on the district court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Peter Phipps of Pennsylvania, Judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Sarah Pittlick of Missouri, Judge on the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Alison Jones-Rushing of North Carolina, Judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Kate Todd of Virginia, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel to the President. Lawrence van Dyke of Nevada, Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Every one of these individuals will ensure equal justice, equal treatment and equal rights for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Together we will defend our righteous heritage and preserve our magnificent American way of life. Thank you, God bless America. Thank you very much. Does anybody have any questions on the judges, please? Anybody? On the judges, excuse me. Any questions? They’re outstanding people. Very important decision, very important that Joe Biden put up potential nominees. I think it’s a very important thing for our country that he do that. Okay, please go ahead. Do you have a question?
Well, I think if you said in order to reduce panic, perhaps that’s so. The fact is I’m a cheerleader for this country. I love our country and I don’t want people to be frightened. I don’t want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I’m not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength. We want to show strength as a nation and that’s what I’ve done. And we’ve done very well. We’ve done well from any standard. You look at our numbers compared to other countries, other parts of the world, it’s been an amazing job that we’ve done. I think it’s very sad in many respects because the incredible individuals working so hard on it, including our Vice President, they’ve done this great job. They haven’t been acknowledged by the news media and they should for the job we’ve done, whether it’s ventilators.
And now you’ll see very soon with vaccines and with therapeutics, the job we’ve done has been incredible, but we don’t want to instill panic. We don’t want to jump up and down and start shouting that we have a problem that is a tremendous problem, scare everybody. And I’ll tell you the other thing, we immediately started buying all over the world. We started buying masks and gowns and everything else, and we don’t want to cause pricing to go up to a level that becomes almost unaffordable. So yeah. And so in that sense, I agree with it. Yeah. Please
Well, I think that’s a really a big part of trust. We have to have leadership. We have to show leadership. And the last thing you want to do is create a panic in the country. This was a horrible thing. It was sent to us by China. Should not have happened, should never have happened. This is a disgusting, terrible situation that was foisted upon us. And we have to show, we just don’t want to use, the best word is panic. We don’t want to have to show panic. We’re not going to show panic. And that’s exactly what I did. And I was very open, whether it’s to Woodward or anybody else, it’s just another political hit job. But whether it was Woodward or anybody else, you cannot show a sense of panic or you’re going to have bigger problems than you ever had before. Please.
Go ahead please.
So I think if we didn’t do what we did, we would have had millions of people die. We closed up our country. We close it up very, very quickly, very effectively. We did a job. We learned about this horrible disease along with the rest of the world, which had to learn about it. And then we opened it up and now we know the vulnerable, we know who it attacks, who it’s so vicious against. And I think we’ve done from every standpoint a incredible job. We shouldn’t have lost anybody. Nobody should have lost. China released something that they shouldn’t have been allowed to, they should not have released. It came out of China, it went to Europe, it went all over the world should have never happened. They could’ve stopped it. They stopped it from going into the remainder of China. It started in Wuhan and they stopped it, but they didn’t stop it from coming to our country.
Now we had to show calm. We had to show, if it was up to you or whoever, I have no idea what he said in the book. And again, it’s a book that I gave him some quotes and frankly, we’ll see how the book turned out. I have no idea. You’re asking me questions for the first time. But again, the last thing we can show is panic or excitement or fear or anything else. We had to take care of the situation we were given. Long before anybody else wanted to do it, I closed our borders to a very heavily infected China. If I didn’t do that, we would have had hundreds of thousands more people die.
Dr. Fauci said it, many people said it. It was a great decision. It was a decision I made and I had to make, it was a decision that a lot of people thought I was wrong. Nancy Pelosi said I was wrong. Joe Biden said I was wrong. They all came back and they said it was the right decision. And I was way early. That was in January. The end of January I did that. So that was a very good thing we did. Otherwise we would have had hundreds of thousands more. But if we didn’t close the country, we would have been talking about millions of people instead of the numbers that we have right now.
You didn’t really think it was going to be to the point where it was. All of a sudden the world was infected. The entire world was infected. Everyone was scrambling around looking where to buy face masks and all of the other things. We’ve opened up factories. We’ve had tremendous success with face masks and with shields and with the ventilators, we’re now supplying the rest of the world. We have all the ventilators we can use. And remember this, the ventilators were very important, not one person that needed a ventilator didn’t get it. And these are very complex, expensive machines to make.
We opened up something like hadn’t been done since the second World War. Honestly, we’ve done an incredible job, but we don’t want to run around screaming, shouting, “Oh, look at this. Look at this.” We have to show leadership. And leadership is all about confidence and confidence is confidence in our country and our people have been great, we’ve been put through a lot by China by releasing this, by having this come here, we will put through a lot. They could have done something about it and they chose not to. I am very honored to have presented to you today a list of 20 incredible people. And we will talk later. I’m sure we’ll be meeting later in the day. Thank you very much.

Hillary Clinton,"I announced today that I am forming a presidential exploratory committee.
I'm not just starting a campaign, though, I'm beginning a conversation -- with you, with America. Because we all need to be part of the discussion if we're all going to be part of the solution. And all of us have to be part of the solution.
Let's talk about how to bring the right end to the war in Iraq and to restore respect for America around the world.
How to make us energy independent and free of foreign oil.
How to end the deficits that threaten Social Security and Medicare.
And let's definitely talk about how every American can have quality affordable health care.
You know, after six years of George Bush, it is time to renew the promise of America. Our basic bargain that no matter who you are or where you live, if you work hard and play by the rules, you can build a good life for yourself and your family.
I grew up in a middle-class family in the middle of America, and we believed in that promise.
I still do. I've spent my entire life trying to make good on it.
Whether it was fighting for women's basic rights or childrens' basic health care. Protecting our Social Security, or protecting our soldiers. It's a kind of basic bargain, and we've got to keep up our end.
So let's talk. Let's chat. Let's start a dialogue about your ideas and mine.
Because the conversation in Washington has been just just a little one-sided lately, don't you think? And we can all see how well that works.
And while I can't visit everyone's living room, I can try. And with a little help from modern technology, I'll be holding live online video chats this week, starting Monday.
So let the conversation begin. I have a feeling it's going to be very interesting.
"
Gordon Brown,"Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, distinguished members of Congress, I come to this great capital of this great nation, an America renewed under a new President to say that America’s faith in the future has been, is and always will be an inspiration to the whole world.
The very creation of America was a bold affirmation of faith in the future: a future you have not just believed in but built with your own hands.
And on January 20th, you the American people began to write the latest chapter in the American story, with a transition of dignity, in which both sides of the aisle could take great pride. President Obama gave the world renewed hope, and on that day billions of people truly looked to Washington D.C as “a shining city upon a hill”.
And I hope that you will allow me to single out for special mention today one of your most distinguished Senators, known in every continent and a great friend. Northern Ireland is today at peace, more Americans have health care, more children around the world are going to school, and for all those things we owe a great debt to the life and courage of, Senator Edward Kennedy.
And so today, having talked to him last night, I want to announce that Her Majesty The Queen, has awarded an honorary Knighthood for Sir Edward Kennedy.
Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, I come in friendship to renew, for new times, our special relationship founded upon our shared history, our shared values and, I believe, our shared futures.
I grew up in the 1960s as America, led by President Kennedy, looked to the heavens and saw not the endless void of the unknown, but a new frontier to dare to discover and explore. People said it couldn’t be done – but America did it.
And 20 years later, in the 1980’s, America led by President Reagan refused to accept the fate of millions trapped behind an Iron Curtain, and insisted instead that the people of Eastern Europe be allowed to join the ranks of nations which live safe, strong and free. People said it would never happen in our lifetime but it did, and the Berlin Wall was torn down brick by brick.
So early in my life I came to understand that America is not just the indispensible nation, it is the irrepressible nation.
Throughout your history Americans have led insurrections in the human imagination, have summoned revolutionary times through your belief that there is no such thing as an impossible endeavour. It is never possible to come here without having your faith in the future renewed.
Throughout a whole century the American people stood liberty’s ground not just in one world war but in two.
And I want you to know that we will never forget the sacrifice and service of the American soldiers who gave their lives for people whose names they never knew, and whose faces they never saw, and yet people who have lived in freedom thanks to the bravery and valour of the Americans who gave the “last full measure of devotion”.
Cemetery after cemetery across Europe honours the memory of American soldiers, resting row upon row – often alongside comrades-in-arms from Britain. There is no battlefield of liberty on which there is not a piece of land that is marked out as American and there is no day of remembrance in Britain that is not also a commemoration of American courage and sacrifice far from home.
In the hardest days of the last century, faith in the future kept America alive and I tell you that America kept faith in the future alive for all the world.
Almost every family in Britain has a tie that binds them to America. So I want you to know that whenever a young American soldier or marine, sailor or airman is killed in conflict anywhere in the world, we, the people of Britain, grieve with you. Know that your loss is our loss; your families’ sorrow is our families’ sorrow and your nation’s determination is our nation’s determination that they shall not have died in vain.
And let me pay tribute to the soldiers, yours and ours, who again fight side by side in the plains of Afghanistan and the streets of Iraq, just as their forefathers fought side by side in the sands of Tunisia, on the beaches of Normandy and then on the bridges over the Rhine.
And after that terrible September morning when your homeland was attacked, the Coldstream Guards at Buckingham Palace played the Star Spangled Banner. Our own British tribute as we wept for our friends in the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And let me promise you our continued support to ensure there is no hiding place for terrorists, no safe haven for terrorism. You should be proud that in the hard years since 2001 you have shown that while terrorists may destroy buildings and even, tragically, lives, they have not, and will not ever, destroy the American spirit.
So let it be said of the friendship between our two countries; that it is in times of trial – true, in the face of fear – faithful and amidst the storms of change – constant.
And let it be said of our friendship – formed and forged over two tumultuous centuries, a friendship tested in war and strengthened in peace – that it has not just endured but is renewed in each generation to better serve our shared values and fulfil the hopes and dreams of the day. Not an alliance of convenience, but a partnership of purpose.
Alliances can wither or be destroyed, but partnerships of purpose are indestructible. Friendships can be shaken, but our friendship is unshakeable. Treaties can be broken but our partnership is unbreakable. And I know there is no power on earth than can drive us apart.
We will work tirelessly with you as partners for peace in the Middle East: for a two state solution that provides for nothing less than a secure Israel safe within its borders existing side by side with a viable Palestinian state.
And our shared message to Iran is simple – we are ready for you to rejoin the world community. But first, you must cease your threats and suspend your nuclear programme. And we will work tirelessly with all those in the international community who are ready to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation.
Past British Prime Ministers have travelled to this Capitol building in times of war to talk of war. I come now to talk of new and different battles we must fight together; to speak of a global economy in crisis and a planet imperilled.
These are new priorities for our new times.
And let us be honest – tonight too many parents, after they put their children to bed, will speak of their worries about losing their jobs or the need to sell the house. Too many will share stories of friends or neighbours already packing up their homes, and too many will talk of a local store or business that has already gone to the wall.
For me, this global recession is not to be measured just in statistics, or in graphs or in figures on a balance sheet. Instead I see one individual with their own aspirations and increasingly their own apprehensions, and then another, and then another.
Each with their own stars to reach for.
Each part of a family, each at the heart of a community now in need of help and hope.
And when banks have failed and markets have faltered, we the representatives of the people have to be the people’s last line of defence.
And that’s why there is no financial orthodoxy so entrenched, no conventional thinking so engrained, no special interest so strong that it should ever stand in the way of the change that hard-working families need.
We have learned through this world downturn that markets should be free but never values-free, that the risks people take should never be separated from the responsibilities they meet.
And if perhaps some once thought it beyond our power to shape global markets to meet the needs of people, we know now that is our duty; we cannot and must not stand aside.
In our families and workplaces and places of worship, we celebrate men and women of integrity who work hard, treat people fairly, take responsibility and look out for others.
If these are the principles we live by in our families and neighbourhoods, they should also be the principles that guide and govern our economic life too.
In these days the world has learned that what makes for the good economy makes for the good society.
My father was a Minister of the church and I have learned again what I was taught by him: that wealth must help more than the wealthy, good fortune must serve more than the fortunate and riches must enrich not just some of us but all.
And these enduring values are the values we need for these new times.
We tend to think of the sweep of destiny as stretching across many months and years before culminating in decisive moments we call history.
But sometimes the reality is that defining moments of history come suddenly and without warning. And the task of leadership then is to define them, shape them and move forward into the new world they demand.
An economic hurricane has swept the world, creating a crisis of credit and of confidence.
History has brought us now to a point where change is essential. We are summoned not just to manage our times but to transform them.
Our task is to rebuild prosperity and security in a wholly different economic world, where competition is no longer local but global and banks are no longer just national but international.
And we need to understand what went wrong in this crisis, that the very financial instruments that were designed to diversify risk across the banking system instead spread contagion across the globe. And today’s financial institutions are so interwoven that a bad bank anywhere is a threat to good banks everywhere.
So should we succumb to a race to the bottom and a protectionism that history tells us that, in the end, protects no-one? No. We should have the confidence that we can seize the opportunities ahead and make the future work for us.
Why?
Because while today people are anxious and feel insecure, over the next two decades literally billions of people in other continents will move from being simply producers of their goods to being consumers of our goods and in this way our world economy will double in size.
Twice as many opportunities for business, twice as much prosperity, and the biggest expansion of middle class incomes and jobs the world has ever seen.
And America and Britain will succeed and lead if we tap into the talents of our people, unleash the genius of our scientists and set free the drive of our entrepreneurs. We will win the race to the top if we can develop the new high value products and services and the new green technologies that the rising numbers of hard-working families across our globe will want to buy.
So we must educate our way out of the downturn, invest and invent our way out of the downturn and re-tool and re-skill our way out of the downturn.
And this is not blind optimism or synthetic confidence to console people; it is the practical affirmation for our times of our faith in a better future.
Every time we rebuild a school we demonstrate our faith in the future. Every time we send more young people to university, every time we invest more in our new digital infrastructure, every time we increase support to our scientists, we demonstrate our faith in the future.
And so I say to this Congress and this country, something that runs deep in your character and is woven in your history, we conquer our fear of the future through our faith in the future.
And it is this faith in the future that means we must commit to protecting the planet for generations that will come long after us.
As the Greek proverb says, why does anybody plant the seeds of a tree whose shade they will never see?
The answer is because they look to the future.
And I believe that you, the nation that had the vision to put a man on the moon, are also the nation with the vision to protect and preserve our planet earth.
And it is only by investing in environmental technology that we can end the dictatorship of oil, and it is only by tackling climate change that we create the millions of new green jobs we need.
For the lesson of this crisis is that we cannot just wait for tomorrow today. We cannot just think of tomorrow today. We cannot merely plan for tomorrow today. Our task must be to build tomorrow today.
And America knows from its history that its reach goes far beyond its geography. For a century you have carried upon your shoulders the greatest of responsibilities: to work with and for the rest of the world. And let me tell you that now more than ever the rest of the world wants to work with you.
And if these times have shown us anything it is that the major challenges we all face are global. No matter where it starts, an economic crisis does not stop at the water’s edge. It ripples across the world. Climate change does not honour passport control. Terrorism has no respect for borders. And modern communications instantly span every continent. The new frontier is that there is no frontier, the new shared truth is that global problems need global solutions.
And let me say that you now have the most pro-American European leadership in living memory. A leadership that wants to cooperate more closely together, in order to cooperate more closely with you. There is no old Europe, no new Europe, there is only your friend Europe.
So once again I say we should seize the moment – because never before have I seen a world so willing to come together. Never before has that been more needed. And never before have the benefits of cooperation been so far-reaching.
So when people here and in other countries ask what more can we do now to bring an end to this downturn, let me say this: we can achieve more working together. And just think of what we can do if we combine not just in a partnership for security but in a new partnership for prosperity too.
On jobs, you the American people through your stimulus proposals could create or save at least 3 million jobs. We in Britain are acting with similar determination. How much nearer an end to this downturn would we be if the whole of the world resolved to do the same?
And you are also restructuring your banks. So are we. But how much safer would everybody’s savings be if the whole world finally came together to outlaw shadow banking systems and offshore tax havens?
Just think how each of our actions, if combined, could mean a whole, much greater than the sum of the parts
– all and not just some banks stabilised
– on fiscal stimulus: the impact multiplied because everybody does it
– rising demand in all our countries creating jobs in each of our countries
– and trade once again the engine of prosperity, the wealth of nations restored.
No one should forget that it was American visionaries who over half a century ago, coming out of the deepest of depressions and the worst of wars, produced the boldest of plans for global economic cooperation because they recognised prosperity was indivisible and concluded that to be sustained it had to be shared.
And I believe that ours too is a time for renewal, for a plan for tackling recession and building for the future. Every continent playing their part in a global new deal, a plan for prosperity that can benefit us all.
First, so that the whole of the worldwide banking system serves our prosperity rather than risks it, let us agree rules and standards for accountability, transparency, and reward that will mean an end to the excesses and will apply to every bank, everywhere, and all the time.
Second, America and a few countries cannot be expected to bear the burden of the fiscal and interest rate stimulus alone. We must share it globally. So let us work together for the worldwide reduction of interest rates and a scale of stimulus round the world equal to the depth of the recession and the dimensions of the recovery we must make.
Third, let us together renew our international economic cooperation, helping the emerging markets rebuild their banks. And let us work together for a low carbon recovery worldwide. And I am confident that this President, this Congress and the peoples of the world can come together in Copenhagen this December to reach a historic agreement on climate change.
And let us not forget the poorest. As we strive to spread the values of peace, political liberty, and the hope for better lives across the world, perhaps the greatest gift our generation could give to the future, the gift of America and Britain to the world could be, for every child in every country of the world, the chance millions do not have today; the chance to go to school.
For let us remember there is a common bond that unites us as human beings across different beliefs, cultures and nationalities. It is at the core of my convictions, the essence of America’s spirit and the heart of all faiths.
And it must be at the centre of our response to the crisis of today. At their best, our values tell us that we cannot be wholly content while others go without, cannot be fully comfortable while millions go without comfort, cannot be truly happy while others grieve alone.
And this too is true. All of us know that in a recession the wealthiest, the most powerful and the most privileged can find a way through for themselves.
So we do not value the wealthy less when we say that our first duty is to help the not so wealthy. We do not value the powerful less when we say that our first responsibility is to help the powerless. And we do not value those who are secure less when we say that our first priority must be to help the insecure.
These recent events have forced us all to think anew. And while I have learnt many things, I keep returning to something I first learned in my father’s church as a child. In this most modern of crises I am drawn to the most ancient of truths; wherever there is hardship, wherever there is suffering, we cannot, we will not, pass by on the other side.
But working together there is no challenge to which we are not equal, no obstacle that we cannot overcome, no aspiration so high that it cannot be achieved.
In the depths of the Depression, when Franklin Roosevelt did battle with fear itself, it was not simply by the power of his words, his personality and his example that he triumphed.
Yes, all these things mattered. But what mattered more was this enduring truth: that you, the American people, at your core, were, as you remain, every bit as optimistic as your Roosevelts, your Reagans and your Obamas.
This is the faith in the future that has always been the story and promise of America. So at this defining moment in history let us renew our special relationship for our generation and our times. Let us restore prosperity and protect this planet and, with faith in the future, let us together build tomorrow today.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much, everybody. It's a great company, and it's an honor to be with you. And we traveled with Darius. He's a great chief executive. He is a -- he's a great businessman. Done a tremendous job with your company.
. I had some good moments here, especially on Election Day. It was a good moment, right?
But they're incredible patriotic and hardworking men and women of Honeywell. Moments ago, we saw the brand-new production lines where you're making high-quality N95 respirators. And they are made to perfection. There's no bad masks, like various countries have been sent -- some very bad masks from other places. There's nothing like that at Honeywell.
Respirators are there to protect our heroic doctors and nurses as they fight the unseen enemy. More than 150 Honeywell employees are working around the clock, three shifts a day, six days a week. You are the greatest industrial -- and think of this, what you've done: You're part of this incredible industrial mobilization. The biggest since World War Two. Hard to believe for an invisible enemy. But it's a vicious enemy, a smart enemy.
Like generations of patriots before you, the workers of this factory are pouring their heart and their soul and their blood into defending our nation and keeping our people healthy and safe. You make America proud. You really do. And I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm here.
I want to thank also the entire leadership team at Honeywell, including Darius -- who's, again, a fantastic man -- Anne Madden, Mike Madsen, John Waldron, Jim Carroll, Brian Rudick, William Lange, Tony Stallings, and Romina Khananisho.
In normal times, it would take nine months to stand up one facility like this. But Honeywell has built this in less than five weeks, creating 500 new jobs in Arizona and another 500 jobs in Rhode Island. Together, these new factories will soon produce more than 20 million N95 respirators every single month. A truly miraculous achievement.
We're grateful to be joined by Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia and Governor Doug Ducey. What a fantastic governor he is. Where is Doug. Thank you, Doug. And he already won his election by, like, 17 points. So I don't have to praise him too much, but I will say that he has been a fantastic governor. And that's -- you people recognize it. That's why he had what they say is a walk. That's very good, and we're proud of you, Doug. And anything we can do, you're going to call me. We don't have to worry about that. He calls me plenty. He calls me plenty because he's doing his job.
But I want to thank you both. And, Gene, the job you're doing is fantastic. Thank you both very much. We appreciate it. Thank you, Gene.
And I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Martha McSally -- a fantastic person. Fantastic person. There must be transparency and accountability. Martha is also somebody that is bringing tremendous amounts of dollars back to her state that she loves so much -- the state of Arizona. And I know the Governor appreciates it very much, Martha. And I appreciate it very much too. You're doing a fantastic job, and good luck. Good luck.
Thank you as well to Betty and Jorge Rivas at Sammy's Mexican Grill in Catalina. Where are they? They're around here someplace. Where is the -- come on up here. Come on up here. Come on. Say a couple of words. You know, I saw them on television. They were being devastated by what happened. And I put out a simple tweet saying what wonderful people they are, and they became very rich. They had lines that went around the block.
Say a few words, please. Come on. There's a mic right over here. I can't believe I have to socially distance myself from these two people.
Please, say a few words.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it. That's beau- -- that's beautiful. Go ahead. Would you like -- would like to say? Go ahead. Please. You can pull that down.
Oh, that's great.
Great people. Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll see you. That's fantastic.
So, today, they took care of 150 healthcare workers at Devon Gables Assisted Living Facility in Tucson. And they've been helping a lot of the people here get some good food. And they're sending Donald Trump the bill. I can't write it off to the government because they wouldn't like that. But we -- we're paying for it. So make sure you get me that bill. But we have -- they are just two terrific people. Again, I saw them on television and they were having a rough time. And now they're doing great. Everybody knows who they are, and they have lines of people wanting to get in. The food is supposed to be fantastic.
To defeat the virus, we are harnessing the unrivaled power of American industry. We're using the Defense Production Act to manufacture over 100,000 additional ventilators on top of our fast-growing national supply. We've mobilized our country. Ventilators are very hard to make. Very complex. Big. Very expensive. And we are now at a point where everybody in this country that's needed a ventilator -- right, Doug? -- has gotten it, especially here in Arizona. Everywhere.
And Doug has had some extra ones, and he sent them to other places where they needed some help. But we have gotten ventilators to everybody, and now we're actually helping other nations and we're using them for stockpiles, in case this horror show ever happens again.
But not a single American who's needed it -- I mean, I'm so proud of that -- has -- because when people -- when we started, we started with -- I use the expression, ""The cupboards were bare."" That means ventilators. It means a lot of other things.
So we're doing something very dramatic, and there's never been -- there hasn't been anything like what we've done since -- this a mobilization -- since World War Two.
We've dramatically accelerated development of new therapies and potential vaccines. Johnson & Johnson, Oxford -- great places. And we have 90 clinical trials underway and hundreds more on the way. And something is going to happen. Tremendous progress is being made. I don't want to talk about it until it's there. We don't want to talk too soon, but I will say, Doug, they really are -- they really -- Darius, they're really making progress. You know some of the companies. They're great companies. You know, the Johnson & Johnson folks have been really fantastic. They want to get to it fast. So, we'll see how it all comes out. And we'll all know very soon, and I think it's going to be a very positive event.
Through FEMA, HHS, and our private sector partners, we're equipping our frontline medical workers with more than 70 million N95 respirators, 112 million surgical masks, 7 million face shields, 18 million gowns, and nearly 1 billion gloves. Today we hear from a few of Honeywell's extraordinary workers who are leading the charge to equip our healthcare heroes and marshal our manufacturing might. That's what it is: It's a manufacturing might that we haven't seen for a long time.
Bruno Aguinaga worked at another company for 22 years, but he jumped at the chance to support America, and America's war against the virus, right here at Honeywell. He's wanted to work at Honeywell always, and he had his chance. Now he is a first-shift team leader.
Bruno, please come up and say a few words. Bruno.
Good.
Thank you, Bruno. Great job. Thank you, Bruno. Appreciate it. Thank you very much, Bruno.
And the next time I'm here, I think we'll -- we'll shake hands and we'll hug each other with the job he is doing. Okay, Bruno.
Ursula Warner is a proud Air Force veteran who courageously served her nation in Afghanistan and all around the world. Now she is continuing her legacy of service right here in Phoenix. Ursula, please come up and tell us how you chose Honeywell and why did you do that.
Thank you. She was retired for about two days. Look how young you are. Retired. Thank you very much. It's a great job, Ursula.
Eric Parks is a Marine Corps veteran and the operations manager at Honeywell's new facility. This is a highly personal mission for Eric. His mother is a nurse, his mother-in-law is a nurse, his brother is a paramedic, and his daughter is about to start her first year of medical school at the University of Arizona. That's one of the great schools.
Eric, please come up. Please. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
As you know, this terrible plague has inflicted grave hardships on our people. We mourn for every life lost. We pray for every victim. And we shoulder this burden together as one people, one family, and one great American nation.
Thanks to the profound commitment of our citizens, we've flattened the curve, and countless American lives have been saved. Our country is now in the next stage of the battle, a very safe phased and gradual reopening. So, reopening of our country -- who would have ever thought we were going to be saying that? A reopening. Reopening.
One day they came to us and they said, ""Sir, we're going to have to close it down."" We had the greatest economy in history. Darius can tell you about that. Greatest economy we've ever had. Best employment numbers in the history of our country. The best stock market in the history of our country. Most number of jobs. Almost 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that. And they said, ""Sir, we have to close it down."" It's a terrible thing, but we did what was right.
And now we're reopening our country, and it's going to be something very special. I was saying before that we're going to have a transition period, the third quarter. It's going to transition. Fourth quarter is going to be very good -- we think very good. And I think next year we're going to have one of the strongest years we've had in a long time, and that's my ambition: to get it back to not only where it was, but to beyond where it was.
And I just want to thank all of the people at this incredible company and this incredible plant. This pandemic has underscored the vital importance of reshoring our supply chains and constructing a powerful domestic manufacturing base. I've been talking about that for a long time. Oftentimes, you'd see a plant like this in a different country, doing the work you could be doing. And you'll do it better.
The United States declared its independence nearly 250 years ago, but in recent decades, Washington politicians allowed our independence to be offshored, outsourced, and ceded to foreign countries.
But we're taking it back, and we've been taking it back. When you look at our job numbers, you knew that -- we were taking it back. When we got up to almost 160 million, something had to be happening. One of the things that happened was we were taking it back. We know it matters where something is made, and we want essential medicines, supplies, and equipment to be manufactured, produced, and made right here in the good old USA.
My administration believes in two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. In the 20th century, Honeywell workers helped make America the world's greatest manufacturing superpower. This is a great company, and it played a very big role.
Now in the 21st century, right here in Phoenix, Arizona, you're reclaiming the noble heritage and writing the next chapter of this incredible American story. And you have a great governor to lead your way, and you have a great senator to lead your way. You have a lot of people that are leading your way.
It was the men and women of Honeywell whose craftsmanship made it possible for Charles Lindbergh to fly across the Atlantic and for Amelia Earhart to break boundaries in the sky.
It was the men and women of Honeywell who built the periscopes, mortar sites, and autopilot systems that powered American warriors as they battled the forces of tyranny and fought to victory in the Second World War.
And it was the unstoppable workers right here at Honeywell that helped our brave astronauts plant our American flag on the face of the Moon. And we're getting ready to do it again. But we're really using the Moon as a landing pad for its journey and our journey together to Mars. It's happening very soon.
Now it is one more time for the men and women of Honeywell who are supplying the weapons, the armor, the sweat, and the scale in a war to defeat the new invisible enemy -- a tough enemy, a smart enemy. But nobody is like us, and nobody is tough like us. And I said it before and I'll say it again: The people of our country are warriors.
With your help, we will vanquish the virus and build a future of greatness and glory with American heart, American hands, American pride, and American soul.
Thank you very much for the incredible job you do. Thank you to Honeywell, to our senator, to our governor. Thank you so much for the incredible job you do. And thank you to the people of Arizona. We will never forget. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Donald Trump,"Well, I think that I've built a great, great company. I know that I've built a great company with a tremendous net worth and meeting a lot of people that are very smart. And that's really what the country needs.
Well, you know, interestingly, I filed applications last time. And I actually filed my net worth. Because I'm a private person, so nobody knows. And people were really shocked at the number. And now the number's a lot bigger than it was. How strong the company is. How much cash? The whole thing. I mean, it's a beautiful company.
It's a company like this country should look.
Probably, over $10 billion.
Well, if I made a decision, I'd spend a lot.
It can be, or more. Yeah, I'd be willing to spend.
If I did it, I'd spend whatever it took.
All right.
Immigration.
Interesting.
Well, you know, he -- I really like him a lot. But you really have to look at what he says about the Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. It's a tough -- it's a tough road he's got to hoe, in my opinion, but I do like him. So let's say Medicare.
Well, wonderful person. He's a wonderful guy.
Obamacare. He really is fighting on trying to stop this absolute disaster for the United States called Obamacare.
Smart.
Why does that make me not serious? I mean, I think that resonated with a lot of people.
I have no idea.
Well, I don't know, was there a birth certificate? You tell me. You know some people say that was not his birth certificate. I'm saying, I don't know, Nobody does. And you don't know either, Jonathan. You're a smart guy. You don't know either.
Pretty, ah. Pretty, pretty. No, no, you said pretty.
Jonathan. excuse me, Jonathan you said you're pretty convinced. OK. So let's just see what happens over time, but it's not my issue, Jonathan.
My issue right now is much different. Wait a minute. My issue is economic. Our country is being ripped apart by China and many other countries. That's my issue.
Well, you just said you're pretty sure. And you're pretty sure, that's not acceptable, because you know, you can't be pretty sure. You have to be 100% sure.
I don't think you are.
Yeah.
Well, if he was born in Canada, perhaps not. But I'm not sure where he was born. I --
OK. Well, then you'll have to ask him that question. But perhaps not.
Look, that will be ironed out. I don't know the circumstances. I heard -- somebody told me he was born in Canada. That's really his thing.
I did.
Well, that is a big question. I do think this: the budget should be funded, but I don't think that Obamacare should be funded. And the Republicans are, in many ways, their own worst enemy. I happen to be a Republican. But if they get together and if they were unified, I think they could do some very serious damage to getting rid of Obamacare, which is a very positive thing for the country.
I do.
I think she'll be very tough.
They need to pick the right candidate. Now, Mitt Romney was, in theory, everything should have been good, but it didn't work. He didn't resonate. And by the way, wonderful guy. Didn't resonate. They have to pick the right candidate.

George Osborne,"Lord Mayor, a year ago, standing here just five weeks after the Government had come to office, I spoke about the financial crisis and I quoted what Winston Churchill had said in this very room in the middle of the war.
“Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”
I believe that sentiment of cautious optimism has been borne out by events in the twelve months since then.
The British economy is recovering.
Output is growing.
The necessary rebalancing of the economy, away from debt-fuelled consumption towards investment and exports has gained momentum.
Half a million new private sector jobs have been created, the second highest rate of net job creation in the whole G7.
Today’s unemployment figures showed a fall of 88,000 – the fastest pace for more than a decade.
Our budget deficit is now falling from its record highs.
Stability has returned.
Britain is on the mend.
But it is taking time.
External shocks have made that recovery more difficult.
The dramatic and debilitating rise in the world’s oil price – up almost 60% since last June.
The terrible Japanese earthquake and the impact on the supply chain.
The on-going crisis in the Eurozone, our largest market for British goods and services.
The softness in the US economy.
Across the world, choppy economic waters have become choppier still.
But the truth is this.
Even without these substantial headwinds, the journey the British economy has to travel would be a hard one.
As I said at the time of the Autumn Forecast last November: “recovery was always going to be more challenging than after previous recessions”.
For we are seeing the unwinding of debts built up over an entire decade.
Of all the major economies in the world, Britain’s was the most over-borrowed.
Our families were more in debt than any other in the G7.
Our house price bubble was bigger than America’s.
Our government deficit higher than that of Greece.
And the balance sheets of our banks went from around 300% of GDP in 1998 to a staggering 550% just a decade later.
Now those bank balance sheets are shrinking.
Not just because of new rules from regulators.
But because the markets themselves demand it.
So money and credit growth remain weak.
And that acts as a powerful drag anchor on recovery.
Here is a striking fact about the British economy over the last six quarters since the recession ended – a fact little understood but crucial to understanding our challenge.
For five out of those six quarters, the financial sector has continued to contract.
While our economy as a whole has grown by 2.5%, the financial sector has shrunk by 4%.
Take the financial sector out of the equation, and economic growth in the rest of the economy during the recovery has actually been above its average rate of the last two decades.
Put the financial sector into the equation, and economic growth has been below trend.
Our banking system fuelled the boom.
Now it is slowing the recovery from the bust.
That might surprise you. Look around the City today, and activity is growing.
The investment banks are hiring again – and they’re hiring here in London.
There are some 25,000 more jobs in the Square Mile than a year ago.
I’ve seen it – I’ve been at the openings of new headquarters and new buildings.
Funds are out there investing.
Law firms, accountants and insurance are busy.
And this year, for all the doomsayers who warn of decline, London has topped the global league table of financial centres.
We’re officially the number one place to do business – so instead of talking ourselves down, let’s agree to go around the world and say so.
Of course, we’ve got to stay in pole position.
That’s why, even in these straightened times, we’ve committed to the multi-billion pound Crossrail link – the greatest urban infrastructure investment in the western world today.
We’ve changed our taxation of overseas earnings, so that multinationals are moving back to Britain instead of leaving it.
I’ve made it clear that the 50 per cent tax rate I inherited must only be temporary – not permanent, as some politicians now propose.
And this week we’re publishing plans that end the uncertainty over tax residence rules and the treatment of non-domiciles, and set out new plans to encourage their investments.
All the activity and wealth creation you see in the City today is very welcome.
But sadly it does not compensate for the many billions of pounds being shed from the balance sheets of our banks.
Economists like Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart warned us that this would be the case – that recoveries from recessions with a financial crisis are always slower than recoveries from other less severe recessions.
How can Government respond?
For a start, we have to avoid that now well-trodden path from banking crisis to sovereign debt crisis.
Unsustainable borrowing in our banks must not lead to unsustainable borrowing by the government.
I promised you a year ago that we would take conscious and determined action.
And we have.
The benefits are there to see.
In a world where so many countries are seeing their credit ratings put on negative outlook or downgraded, our country’s triple-A rating has come off negative outlook and been affirmed.
We have a deficit larger than Portugal, but virtually the same interest rates as Germany.
That is the huge stimulus our plan delivers to our economy.
And abandoning our deficit reduction plan would take that stimulus away.
That was the IMF’s verdict last week.
In the recovery from a banking crisis, stability and low market rates are precious, hard-won achievements.
And we will do nothing to undermine them.
Instead, we should try to manage the nature and pace of the deleveraging.
A large part of the rapid build up of borrowing within our banking sector consisted of lending from one part of the financial system to another.
That can be reduced without directly impacting the real economy, even if it reduces the measured contribution of banking to GDP.
What is crucial is that this inevitable process of deleveraging does not strangle the supply of credit to businesses and families who need it.
We are taking action to ensure this doesn’t happen.
We are resolving regulatory uncertainty and encouraging new capital investment in our banking system, so that deleveraging is not only achieved through smaller balance sheets.
In the G20 and the Basel Committee, Britain has successfully argued for higher capital and liquidity standards, but crucially for standards that are phased in over long time periods.
And the new Financial Policy Committee has been mandated to take an overview of our financial system, and watch that our own regulators do not act in a pro-cyclical way.
We have struck the Merlin deal with the banks to prevent small and medium sized businesses becoming the innocent victims of shrinking balance sheets.
I very much welcome the commitments from the BBA’s taskforce and the new Business Growth Fund that is now investing in Britain’s businesses.
But the banks should also be in no doubt that I will use every tool available to me to hold them to the published lending commitments they made.
Lord Mayor, the Government can also actively help to rebalance our economy by being unequivocally pro-business and pro-enterprise.
Our Plan for Growth set out a new wave of supply side reforms to restore Britain’s competitiveness.
We’re investing in apprenticeships, cutting employment tribunal costs, reforming pensions and anti-growth planning rules, reducing regulation, creating a Green Investment Bank, reforming the welfare system and taking low paid people out of tax.
And we’re actively pursuing the lowest business tax rates of any major western economy – a 5% reduction in the rate of corporation tax in the space of just four years.
From Shanghai to Seattle, investors can see that Britain is open for business.
So while the gradual unwinding of the debts built up in the boom creates powerful headwinds, all of this demonstrates that we are not powerless to respond.
But the legacy of the financial crisis does confront us with a very simple dilemma – what you might call ‘the British Dilemma’.
As a global financial centre that generates hundreds of thousands of jobs, a successful banking and financial services industry is clearly in our national economic interests.
But we cannot afford to let it pose a risk to the stability and prosperity of the nation’s entire economy.
We should strive for global success in financial services, but that success should not come at an unacceptably high price.
We should be clear that we want Britain to be the home of some of the world’s leading banks, but those banks cannot be underwritten by the British taxpayer.
I said here last year that the uncertainty hanging over your industry was causing real damage; that it couldn’t be resolved overnight, but that I owed you a process that would lead to a conclusion.
And one year on, I believe we are much closer to a consensus on how we can achieve both successful, competitive financial services and a healthy, balanced economy.
That consensus is about:
What is the right culture of regulation;
How the international rules apply;
And where successful banks fit in.
First, the culture of regulation.
The failure of the tripartite system was not a series of unfortunate accidents – it was hard-wired into its design.
The decision to divide the responsibility for assessing systemic financial risks from the responsibility for applying that assessment to particular financial institutions created a world in which no one was in charge.
Yet at the same time the system required endless box ticking and costly processes.
We had the worst of both worlds
This new Government proposes, therefore, a completely new culture of regulation.
Tomorrow we publish our White Paper and the detailed draft legislation.
A permanent Financial Policy Committee will be established inside the Bank of England.
Its remit will be set by Parliament and refined by the Chancellor on an annual basis.
And its job will be to monitor overall risks in the financial system, identify bubbles as they develop, spot dangerous inter-connections and deploy new tools to deal with excessive levels of leverage before it is too late.
This has never been done before.
The Committee will work alongside a new Prudential Regulation Authority that will also sit in the Bank of England.
This will assess the safety and soundness of individual firms.
I’ve heard your argument that insurance companies face different risks, so I can announce that we will set a specific statutory objective for them.
The operation of markets, and the protection of consumers, will be the responsibility of a new Financial Conduct Authority.
I am delighted that Martin Wheatley, who brings valuable experience as Hong Kong’s market regulator, will be the new CEO.
Here too we’ve listened to representations, and I confirm tonight that as well as protecting consumer interests, the Financial Conduct Authority will have a new primary duty to promote competition.
If the result of all these changes is simply that some brass plates on some doors have changed, then we will have failed.
We don’t undertake the institutional change for the sake of it. We do it to change the culture.
We want to move away from the tick-box mentality of the current system, where there’s no shortage of costly regulation but too little room for invaluable judgement.
In its place we will have clear lines of accountability and the space for regulators to exercise judgment.
You will have the freedom to innovate, grow your businesses, and compete in the world.
You will be constrained if you put taxpayers or consumers at undue risk.
A new culture of regulation is the first step towards solving the British Dilemma.
But getting supervision right in one country is not enough.
As the world’s leading financial centre, we are particularly exposed to financial instability elsewhere in the world.
And you are all exposed to fierce overseas competition.
For both these reasons, global standards are strongly in our national interest.
So we want to see the full implementation of the new Basel standards, right around the world, including here in European Union.
It’s vital that those European rules give national regulators the discretion to add to the Basel requirements when national circumstances require it.
This is what the de Larosière committee themselves recommended. It would help the FPC do their job.
We need European coordination, to enforce common rules in a single market, and it’s good news that the headquarters of the new European Banking Authority is here in London.
We support their efforts to make this year’s stress tests mode credible than last year’s.
But we will always fight hard against badly thought-through European regulation that undermines Europe as a location for wholesale finance, or London’s role as this continent’s pre-eminent global centre for it.
That’s a fight we won on the regulation of hedge funds, and we’re still fighting on EMIR, the new derivatives regulation.
Pay in the financial services sector should also be regulated internationally, to avoid a race to excess.
Britain now has world-beating standards of transparency.
The Financial Stability Board have come up with good principles and must now focus on their consistent implementation.
So, Lord Mayor, these are the first two steps towards solving the British Dilemma:
A new culture of regulation that judges unacceptable risks, while creating the space for innovation and commercial success.
And an agreed set of international rules that makes the global financial system safer and protects us from competitive arbitrage by other financial centres.
But history teaches us that that risk can never be reduced to zero.
We cannot hope to abolish boom and bust.
So the British Dilemma will remain as long as taxpayers are first on the hook if things do go wrong.
When this Government came to office there was no agreement in Britain about how this ‘too-big-to-fail’ problem should be addressed.
Indeed, I’ve sat as a guest at this very dinner in years past listening as one speech from this lectern was completely contradicted by the speech that followed.
That’s why when I first spoke here, I announced the names of five highly respected individuals whose job it would be to listen to all sides of the argument, propose a solution and help bring an end to the uncertainty.
The Independent Commission on Banking has now published its Interim Report and I would like to pay tribute to Sir John Vickers and his fellow Commissioners for the excellent job they have done.
It has commanded respect at home and huge interest abroad.
The Independent Commission on Banking has put forward two particularly important proposals.
Bail-in instead of bail-out – so that private investors, not taxpayers, bear the losses if things go wrong.
And a ring fence around better capitalised high street banks to make them safer, and to protect their vital services to the economy if things go wrong.
Today I have told the Commission that the Government endorses both these proposals in principle.
Of course, the Commissioners are still consulting and preparing their final report – and I won’t pre-empt their conclusions.
We will judge their final proposals in practice against the following conditions:
All banks should be allowed to fail safely without affecting vital banking services;
Without imposing costs on the taxpayer;
In a manner applicable across our diverse sector;
And consistent with EU and international law.
In line with the interim report, we agree with the need for further capital requirements on systemically important banks, but I agree with the Commission that outside the ring-fence this is best done internationally.
I also strongly welcome the Commission’s proposal on increasing competition in retail banking.
For healthy competition is a powerful defender of consumers’ interests.
Lord Mayor, we will make these changes to banking to protect taxpayers in the future.
But we still have to clear up the mess of the past.
Taxpayers today own a large part of the banking system, and underwrite guarantees to parts of the rest.
It’s time we started to plan our exit.
So I’ve opened the Credit Guarantee Scheme to early redemption.
I’m pleased that banks are taking up the opportunity and they are ahead of schedule in repaying the Bank of England’s special liquidity support.
This is a sign of confidence in our banking system.
And I remind everyone with deposits that we have increased the level of deposit insurance to 100% for sums up to £85,000 and we have made clear that there is no implicit taxpayer guarantee for sums above that level.
Once all these other forms of subsidy are removed, our direct shareholdings in banks still remain.
It will take some time – possibly several years – before we can sell them all.
But we can start that process.
I can announce tonight that on behalf of you the British taxpayer, I have decided to put Northern Rock up for sale.
Images of the queues outside Northern Rock branches were a symbol of all that went wrong, and its chaotic collapse did great damage to Britain’s international reputation.
Its return now to the private sector would help to rebuild that reputation.
It would be a sign of confidence and could increase competition in high street banking.
We could start to get at least some of our money back.
The sale process will be open and transparent and in line with state aid rules.
Any interested parties can bid for it, including mutuals, which this Government is actively committed to promoting.
We will continue to own Northern Rock Asset Management, the separate “bad bank”, whose assets are being run down over time.
This does not mean that other options to return Northern Rock to the private sector have been ruled out.
But the independent advice I have received is that a sale process is likely to generate substantially the best value for the taxpayer and should be explored as a first option.
And it would be a very important first step in getting the British taxpayer out of the business of owning banks – and a sign of confidence in the industry.
Lord Mayor, last year I came here with debates raging about all these questions of regulation and the future of banking.
I was not the cause of them – but I told you that it was my job to resolve them.
And I said that our goal should be a new settlement between our financial system and the British people.
A new settlement where the City is able to be the leading financial centre in the world, without putting at risk the entire economy.
I believe we are now within touching distance of that new settlement.
If we achieve it, then we will have answered the British Dilemma – and put our country on the path to prosperity.
I want the City of London to be a thriving centre of enterprise, more interested in serving its customers than in what Government might do to it next.
Resolving the British Dilemma is the way to do that.
Thank you.

Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm honored to be joined by Prime Minister Löfven of Sweden at our first meeting in the White House.
Sweden is one of our oldest and closest partners
My daughter
That was something
The Prime Minister and I have just concluded a series of very productive meetings. The relationship between the United States and Sweden is one based on shared values
We look forward to exploring further opportunities to increase our security and our cooperation in every other way. And we encourage nations around the world to share responsibility for our common defense. We appreciate Sweden's leadership on the United Nations Security Council
The United States is also grateful to Sweden for advocating for Americans detained in North Korea. I particularly want to thank the Swedish government for its assistance in securing the release of American college student Otto Warmbier last year. Terrible
And we remain determined to achieve a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And there's been a lot of news on that today. Hopefully
In economic matters
Earlier this afternoon
We're also continuing to pursue bilateral agreements to advance mutual prosperity. I'm pleased that Sweden intends to procure the Patriot air and missile defense system -- finest in the world -- in a deal worth over $3 billion. This system will increase stability and security in the Baltic Sea region.
A strong and balanced economic relationship strengthens security and prosperity in both of our countries. And this is just the beginning. We have a lot of things that we're working on. And we're working on them
Mr. Prime Minister
The longstanding friendship between our people
Thank you very much. John.
Well
And I don't blame the countries. I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. When I was with President Xi in China -- as an example
But it's like that with many countries
I'm here to protect. And one of the reasons I was elected is I'm protecting our workers
So we're doing tariffs on steel. We cannot lose our steel industry. It's a fraction of what it once was. And we can't lose our aluminum industry. Also a fraction of what it once was.
And our country is doing well. The massive tax cuts and all of the deregulation has really kicked us into gear. But I have to work on trade deals. We're working on NAFTA right now. And if we're able to make a deal with Canada and Mexico in NAFTA
But again
Well
You know
They'll like us better and they will respect us much more. Because even they say -- right now
Just to add maybe a little bit further: If you talk China
So China doesn't send us 2 percent; they send us a much
And you know there's a theory that if a country doesn't have steel
But again
I think you have a wonderful Prime Minister
But as far as our relationship with Sweden
We've been working on North Korea. Sweden has somewhat of a relationship with North Korea. We've been working with North Korea. As I said
They really have been terrific. Really terrific. Saagar Enjeti
Me. No
But the sanctions have been very
Many
It's got tremendous energy. It's tough. I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view
But the White House has a tremendous energy
Please.
Well
We're doing a very
But the big thing would be the tax cut and the regulations cuts. Also
So I think we're going to do very well
So based on that
But we're studying it very closely. Various agencies
Maybe almost everything?
"
Bill Benyon,"I am sorry that the hon. He conjures up a terrible picture of stomping up the Corridor, glaring at Her Majesty, and coming back again. However, most people will find quite a lot in the Queen’s Speech.
I do not think that anybody can take exception to what is said in the Queen’s Speech about Northern Ireland, that the Government ​
“will seek widely acceptable arrangements for the devolution of power. They will seek to improve further their co-operation with the Government of the Irish Republic.”
I do not know whether an arrangement with the Irish Republic will be possible and, even if it is, I do not know what will be in it, but we are right to try. When I listened to the speeches by two Northern Ireland Members, which were moderate and sensible, I wished sometimes that people who represent Northern Ireland would accept that the poor old British Government are not trying to trample anybody underfoot, except the terrorists. We are trying to find a solution to a very difficult problem, and the Government should be given every support for trying to reach an agreement with a sovereign power, without which we do not stand a chance of solving the problem.
I warmly welcome the measures to strengthen the powers of the police, which are greatly needed. I shall refer to that later.
I should like to refer to the removal of statutory restrictions on shop opening hours. My position on shop opening hours is well known. I have taken an unequivocal stance about the proposed measures. My only plea to the Government is that we should get together on this and that if there is whipping on the main question, there should at least be some means to amend the Bill in Committee, which I hope will be on the Floor of the House.
I wish to concentrate on the statement in the Gracious Speech that the Government will take measures to facilitate
“further reductions in the burden of income tax.”
Consideration of the Gracious Speech allows us to look ahead to the parliamentary year and to consider what should be done in the programme for that period. By far the most crucial event will be the Budget next spring. The Queen’s Speech obviously makes no reference to what we may expect from the Budget other than the words that I have quoted, but now is the time for hon. Members to make their views known—at the start of the new Session. It is no good waiting until all the deliberations have taken place and this major event stares us in the face next spring.
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has made it clear that his purpose is to make cuts in the rates of direct taxation, which he sees as a further stimulus to the economy, with consequent effects on unemployment. The Government have had considerable success with the economy. We have heard about some of these already today—the reduction in inflation, the new realism between employer and employee, the improvement in the performance of nationalised industries and more recently, as was revealed so rightly and cogently by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, the upturn in economic activity generally.
For me, the key is to build on those successes in a constructive way. If any surplus available next spring is used to reduce direct taxation across the board and the pound remains high, a great deal of the extra spending will go on imports. In view of our strong balance of payments at present this might be acceptable if the incentive effect was strong, but I do not believe that it is. I do not believe that people work harder or start businesses just because two or three pence are taken off income tax. The exception to this is the lower paid. If the reliefs were concentrated there, well and good. To be truly an incentive the reliefs must be dramatic, but to be dramatic they must necessarily ​ be expensive. That is the problem. We cannot do that without a much higher surplus than we are likely to have next spring.
We are a mixed economy, like every other Western country, all of which have varying degrees of Government intervention. The greatest measure of Government intervention occurs in the United States of America, and people tend to forget that. Government intervention in this country varies from sector to session, but overall it is very strong, although Socialists would like it to be much stronger. I see it as essentially a pump-priming operation, initiating improvements and fading out when the private sector can take over.
I do not conceal the fact that I am enormously influenced by the success of Milton Keynes, my own constituency, where the state has provided a framework for a burgeoning development of commerce and industry—an example which has been followed in the urban development corporations.
That example should also be followed in the depressed parts of the inner cities. No one has been a stronger supporter of local government independence than I have, but I accept that people such as Mr. Grant have driven business and commerce away from those areas. If we really want to revitalise those areas and encourage employment, it must be done by an agency which knows what it is about and has the commercial expertise to do it.
I want the Government to achieve the triple goal of social progress, reduction of unemployment and revitalisation of British industry. Hon. Members have already mentioned the very cogent report that was produced by the Lords. That report should not be swept under the carpet. It bears a great deal of reading because it was written by people with experience on the ground in British industry, and that is extremely important.
People today are very aware that so much in our country is second rate. They want to see better housing, because they know how much of our housing is bad. They want better education and better health care, although we have already done a great deal in that area. They want clean streets, clean air and clean water. They want an efficient transport system of which we can be proud. Many more people, too, want a stronger effort to be made to help the Third world. That pressing need has already been stressed in the debate and we must take note of it.
When the Government took office in 1979. it was accepted on all sides that the rates of taxation were far too high and that it was quite right to bring them down. The position is different now. Faced with the choice of even lower taxes or improved services and infrastructure, I believe that most people would choose the latter. It is generally accepted that a great deal needs to be done and must be done. It must be done efficiently, but, as my hon. If the additional expenditure is administered wisely, the money will be spent in this country, not on imports. There will be a direct effect on employment, and the additional advantage that carefully controlled inflation of this kind can be met by the existing resources of British industry.
Nothing can excuse the recent violence in Birmingham and London, and the first absolute priority is that the law must be upheld. Nevertheless, something must be done about the environment in those very bad areas, and that means spending money. If we do not tackle those and ​ similar tasks, the situation will become far worse. The inequalities between those who have jobs and those who do not, and between one part of the country and another, will become worse and the ideal of one nation, which has inspired moderate politicians for more than a century, although many have expressed it in different words, will recede further into the future.
We have so much to do. If people want these things to happen, they must will the means. That is the message for this Session, and now is the time to make it clear, as Ministers decide what will be in the Budget next spring. My message is simple—do not cut taxes, build a better Britain.
"
Damian Hinds,"Thank you very much to Reform for hosting this morning. Your organisation has a long track record taking on the big issues in public policy.
This isn’t in the strictest sense a scripted speech. I think it’s probably fair to say that makes my brilliant civil servants a little nervous this morning, but I’ll still ask them and you to bear with me for the next… Well, we never know exactly how long, but don’t worry, it won’t be too long.
I wanted to take the opportunity to draw together some of what we know now that we didn’t know a relatively short time ago, about the nature of disadvantage in education and attainment, and then of course in what happens in later life. Why does this matter? Well, I don’t think you would ask that question, because I think to everybody in this room it is self-evident that in public policy, in government, in what all the organisations represented here do, we should be constantly redoubling efforts to equalise the odds.
Because no child’s prospects in life should be limited by the circumstances of their birth or who they were born to. They should have no limits other than the talents and the application that they themselves will put in.
There’s also of course a hard-nosed economic argument. Because if we’re going to have an economy that’s operating at its maximum potential, which, of course, in turn is what allows us to afford the excellent public services that we all rely on, we do need every child to be able to fulfil absolutely their full potential.
So, this sort of thing will be familiar, I think, to you all. We know that obviously people have innate ability, but how that is able to translate into attainment in school and then what happens later, can get significantly affected both by the background, the circumstances they’re born into and the experiences that they go through.
It goes without saying, by the way, that obviously you also need to put the work in at school. But I’m just taking that for granted. This is about the factors that we as individuals perhaps can’t control. We know that the gaps in attainment, in development, actually start to appear from very early on in life. So, even in the early years the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged is something like four months of development. But it keeps on growing as you go through school.
By the end of Key Stage 4, in other words GCSE time, that gap is the equivalent of 19 months. In research that we released last year we showed that the effect of being a child who is eligible for free school meals still shows up in the data, in the workforce. So, still at age 27, you’re materially less likely to be in good, sustained employment if you’ve been on free school meals than somebody who was not.
We also know that it can become something of a cycle. Because there’s a multigenerational impact that then means if you haven’t managed to, break out of that cycle then another generation also experiences some disadvantage coming through.
Charlotte mentioned this, and this is worth reflecting on. The gap between the rich and the poor has narrowed in this country. And this isn’t something that’s happened all over the world. It’s not something natural or inevitable.
When Michael Gove first instituted the reforms that started in 2010, he was very clear all the way through that we as a government should always be measured on two sets of criteria. First, that we’re raising the attainment overall. But secondly, that with everything we are also narrowing the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged.
And this is something very much to be celebrated. But of course, you’ll have spotted that if you reduce the gap by 9% or 13%, the gap is still very large. Some of the things that I think would have helped this progress are things like the Pupil Premium, the Education Endowment Foundation.
Also the two-year-old offer, ensuring that more disadvantaged children have the benefit of high-quality early years education. Sponsored academies, and free schools, and the general school improvement drive that we’ve had consistently through that time. And of course most of all, teachers. It is the people who run, who operate education. Who inspire the next generation, who have made it happen.
The problem we have right now is that although we’ve seen this great progress, although the gap has been narrowing, the pace has started to slow. So, if we’re going to sustain the progress on narrowing the gap, we need to figure out what else we need to do. We need to think about what we need to do differently.
And that’s really what today is about. It’s about recognising the face of disadvantage; understanding more about aspects of disadvantage. It’s about recognising how disadvantage may have changed in certain respects, or for certain groups. And it’s also about understanding more about the scale of particular types of factors, and how they may have changed.
And then ultimately, of course, whatever you know about disadvantage, the question is, what are you going to do about it? Both within the school system and also because schools cannot do everything. We cannot expect them to do everything. It’s a wider societal question of how the rest of society operates.
So, today, I’m going to particularly cover five areas associated with disadvantage: Ethnicity, language, place, or in other words part of the country, the home environment and adversity in childhood. Some of those things you can think of as being more about the background of the child, more about where they’ve come from, and some of them are more about the experiences, the things that happen to that child during the course of their childhood. But actually, each of them has some elements typically of both.
I’m not going to cover absolutely everything about disadvantage, otherwise we really would be here a very long time this morning. But in particular, I want to mention two very important areas.
Mental health – we are more attentive today than ever before and we know that mental health problems can affect all sorts of young people. Of course, those in the most difficult circumstances are most likely to face this adversity. We’ve been doing quite a lot on mental health, both in terms of the Mental Health Green Paper, making sure that support networks will be available around schools, and Designated Mental Health Leads in schools. But also crucially, from an early age, through the new health education curriculum, we’ll be talking about mental health. Including talking at quite a young age about some of the strategies that you can put in place on self-regulation, on trying to help cope with the difficulties that come along in life.
And you’ll also have heard the Prime Minister speaking this morning about the announcement today on mental health including enhancing the content in initial teacher training about spotting the early signs of mental health difficulties.
And then of course, there’s the whole area of SEND. Special Educational Needs and Disabilities, which is in itself a huge and varied area in terms of the effect on children. It’s not something I’m going to cover today, but it is something that we will be coming back to in a similar vein.
But it’s worth saying that all of these things can interact with each other. Clearly, everybody has an ethnicity and they live somewhere, and sometimes the danger is that we spot something, which we think is to do with one of those factors, when actually it’s to do with another. And they can easily be conflated.
It is also true that things can operate one on top of another. So, you can have a cumulative effect of different disadvantages. They don’t quite work in a purely mathematical additive way, but they do concentrate the effects of each other. So, for example, later on when we talk about Children in Need, that is to say children who have need of the services of a social worker, many also have Special Educational Needs and are eligible for free school meals. That number of children adds up to 120,000.
So, the Prime Minister instituted the Race Disparity Audit, to ask some of those difficult questions and face up to what can be difficult and deeply uncomfortable answers, when we look at the different experiences of people of different ethnicities in our society. And part of that is about education.
Now, what do we see when we look at the experiences of people from different ethnic groups? Some ethnic groups experience a below average experience and attainment pretty much across the board. So, if we talk about black Caribbean children, for example, they are more likely than white British children to be eligible for free school meals, and they are likely to statistically attain a lower level when it comes to GCSEs.
But for other groups, it can be more complex. This chart here shows the experience of black African children on average. Again, it’s important to stress, on average. Because of course, in every ethnic group you have a wide distribution. Although, that reverses when you take other factors into account. But when they get there, they are less likely to complete with a top degree, a first or a 2:1. Later on in life, they’re more likely to be in work but they’re less likely to experience good earnings growth.
So, as I say, a complicated picture. .When we talk about social mobility, or disadvantage, how often do we just focus on GCSE attainment and assume that everything else will follow? Or historically, and I’ve been guilty of this myself, said that, the ability to go to university can be the most life-changing opportunity. That can be true. But not if you don’t finish university. So, we need to think about every stage along the way.
There is another group of children who we often mention, but sometimes just in passing. Which is white British children. Among the disadvantaged population the lowest performing group is white British children. This isn’t among the population as a whole, but just among those who are classed as disadvantaged.
If we talk about ethnicity, we tend to talk about all other ethnicities and then sometimes say, well, of course we mustn’t forget this group of white British children. But then you convert the charts by volume and you realise that almost two thirds of the cohort of disadvantaged children are white British. So, if we are to really, really narrow the gap when it comes to the disadvantaged kids versus the rest, it is important to think about the places where there is a heavy concentration of white British children, as well as about the places where there are heavy concentrations of other ethnicities and those that are more diverse.
So, let me move onto language, and you might think that having English as an additional language is a disadvantage at school. In fact, ladies and gentlemen, children with English as an additional language perform slightly better when it comes to GCSEs. Not a huge amount and not in every subject, but about half a grade better on average across eight subjects. It’s a slightly counterintuitive result. Let me explain this graph. Those who have very recently arrived do worse. But the longer you’re in the system, the better you do. And in fact most of the gap is gone within three years. If you’ve been here longer, you actually perform on par with or even slightly outperform the average.
And it’s sometimes also thought that it’s not good for the rest of the class if you have a number of kids with English as an additional language. But actually, that’s not true either. The evidence shows there is no, disadvantage for other children in the class. In fact, there can be a slight advantage. But again, it’s important to stress that pupils with English as an Additional Language is a large group, which covers a number of different types of circumstance, and clearly, as this chart shows, there is a huge difference between being a newly arrived refugee and being a child growing up in a multilingual household.
Now, I said at the start there is often an overlap between a number of these different factors, and I’m now going to talk about an important overlap between language and place. In this city, London, there is an extraordinary number of children who have English as an additional language.
In fact, of last year’s Year 6, so in other words the kids who just started secondary school, in London 49% of them were classed as having English as an Additional Language. And that may be one of the reasons, but only one – and I’m going to say a number of times in the next few minutes that there are many, many reasons why performance in London is different – but that may be one of the reasons why London children do so much better than children elsewhere in the country.
This table charts the different stages of school: early years, infants, juniors, secondary and higher education, for those who go. It shows separately, for all children and for those eligible for free school meals, what the performance is for children in London compared to elsewhere.
You’ll see that among pupils as a whole, actually in the early years and the infants there’s not much difference really at all. They’re performing on par. Then they start performing a bit better, and a bit better, and by the time you talk about entry to a selective university as opposed to a recruiting university, you’re 1.5 times, 50% more likely to go if you’re a child in London.
But it’s among the disadvantaged, among those eligible for free school meals, were the really striking difference is. The gap’s actually already there in nursery school and in infant school. And then it carries on growing as well, but the multiplicative effect is that by the time you talk about whether or not you’re going to a selective university, a free school meals eligible child in London is twice as likely as a free school meals eligible child elsewhere.
What is different about London? I’ve said I was going to say this a number of times. Almost everything, actually. And that’s one of the reasons why it’s so difficult to ascribe exact causes to the effects that we see of these strong results. Families are different. Places are different. The work environment is different. What children walk past to go to school is different. Pretty much everything is different.
Some things aren’t different, it’s worth saying, and sometimes they are the things that people most naturally look to as being likely drivers of difference in performance. But let me give you an example of a couple of these things, which are different and might surprise people that have an effect.
First of all, tutoring. There’s a very high proportion of children in London who have tutors, and by the way, before anyone says it, this didn’t start in 2010. This is a long-standing phenomenon. Both that there are high levels of tutor usage in London and a gap between that level in London and the rest of the country.
Shorter distances. It may seem like a trite and obvious point. But in a city, which is much more concentrated than most of our country, it means that from a school choice perspective, for example, you’ve got that many more schools within a reasonable travel distance. Even if you compare, say, Lambeth with Manchester, there are twice as many schools within a one-mile radius in Lambeth, as there are in Manchester, and of course that ends up being important also later on in life.
There are also many more universities. The average travel to university is 59 miles. There are many, many more universities within 59 miles in this city than there are in most parts of the country. And in terms of work opportunities, the opportunities are that much greater. So, there are many, many possible explanations of why London outperforms the rest of the country. The one that is most often cited I’m going to suggest is not likely to be the biggest factor. The thing which is most often cited is a thing called the London Challenge, and for those of you in this room who worked on the London Challenge, let me be clear, I’m not dismissing the London Challenge. It was a very good thing to do and actually elements of it we have, shamelessly, borrowed for use elsewhere, for example in what we’re now doing in the north east.
But the year that London started outperforming the rest of the country on GCSEs was the same year that the London Challenge started. So, in other words those kids had just been alive for 16 years, not under the London Challenge.
And, in fact we see, as I’ve shown on the previous slide, that the outperformance of London was also in primary school and indeed in early years, whereas as the London Challenge initially was only focussed on secondary.
There is some good news for the rest of the country of course as well on this, which is that the city effect doesn’t seem to occur only in London. So, some of the things I was talking about, like distance for example, of course are also relevant elsewhere.
And, we find that if we look at cities, and this is new research that we’re releasing today, disadvantaged kids in our bigger cities do better than in school settings elsewhere.
If we take Birmingham, for example: disadvantaged children in Birmingham will have a stronger performance than, say, neighbouring boroughs, Solihull, Dudley and so on, as well as performing above the national average.
The performance of disadvantaged children in our biggest cities overall exceeds that in other types of areas. The north-south divide, ladies and gentlemen, I think there is still some truth to there being some differences on average in the north and south, but actually it’s far too simplistic a concept, if we’re to understand the complex makeup of the United Kingdom today.
There’s another type of location, which we’ve had more focus on of late, and we now understand in greater detail: coastal areas, where people have long had a sort of suspicion that there is something endemic, which means that performance is lower on average. Again, there’s a big spread that will be lower, among disadvantaged children in coastal areas and elsewhere.
And the new research that we’ve got demonstrates that that is indeed true. It’s no coincidence that our Opportunity Areas Programme includes many coastal towns, like Blackpool and Hastings and Scarborough and the north coast.
One other area I want to touch on is the North East. This is relevant to the discussion about opportunity areas, because we’ve had some criticism that we didn’t have any opportunity areas initially in the North East.
The reason for that is that nowhere in the North East fits the normal criteria that there isn’t a sufficient proportion of very strongly performing schools, because actually there are loads of really, really strongly performing schools in the North East.
What’s different about the North East is that at primary and indeed early years, there’s a very, very heavy preponderance of very strongly performing schools, but at secondary, whilst there are a number of brilliant schools, as there are everywhere, it’s a much, much lower preponderance.
What that means is that the outcomes for kids, by the time they get to 16, are lower than they are elsewhere. And then the progression on to college or on to university is lower as well. And so we introduced Opportunity North East specifically to look at that disparity between primary and secondary, to work on the transition from primary, secondary and to work with a number of secondary schools on school improvement.
There are great schools everywhere, as I’ve just said, this is a map of outstanding schools. In every single part of the country there are outstanding schools.
And it is worth just repeating, as everybody in this room knows well, that whatever we say about people’s background, whatever is true about people’s experiences, school can make a massive, massive difference, specifically the teachers within that school can make a massive, massive difference, but you do have to be there.
We completed an extended project looking at exclusions, and you’ll be familiar with the very important findings from Edward Timpson’s report, and I want to thank him again for the extensive work he did.
But actually I think one of the most important findings, from my perspective, to come out of that was about all the children who were not in school, who have not been excluded. And actually it turns out that there are a lot more children not in school, than those who have been permanently excluded.
Now, that could be for many different reasons, but quite a few of them are unauthorised persistent absence, or what I call hyper-persistent absence. Hyper-persistent absence is when you’re missing half of school.
Now the full amount includes others as well, including people who are away for medical reasons, for good reasons, but a significant proportion of that number are out of school unauthorised.
And I said, although we’ve got a lot of focus on the permanently excluded, we need to worry as much actually about these children, those who are on unauthorised absence, and particularly the vulnerabilities that they may then experience.
Okay, so we talked about place, there is another place that probably doesn’t get quite enough attention, and that is the home. I mentioned right at the start that there could be a lot of overlap between different factors, and actually most factors, if we talk about ethnicity, most of the factors,in different performance, different attainment of groups of kids with different ethnicities, actually could be explained by other things, including the home.
And we know that the home learning environment, what parents do, is actually far more important than who the parents are. And we know that in the very earliest years, gaps appear in development, at even at age two and three, and about a fifth of the difference in development of cognitive ability, about a fifth, is to do with, parental engagement. This really matters, because, as I said at the start, you know, we know that gaps appear early, but we also know that they grow. And if we’re serious about social mobility, if we’re serious about narrowing that gap, then actually we have to pay attention to what happens in the very earliest years and we have the knowledge that what happens in the very earliest years actually happens mostly at home.
I had a conversation with Alan Milburn a few years ago, and I can’t remember if I said it to him and he agreed or he said it to me and I agreed. I’m happy to credit Alan with the phrase, that home is the last taboo in public policy.
Because none of want to go there, nobody wants to be the politician that starts talking about ‘you should do this and do that’ or make it sound like they think they know better than a family. I don’t want to be that person either.
But if we are serious about social mobility, we have to go there; we have to care about the home learning environment, because it is going to determine the futures of a lot of those children. And that is why we’re putting in place a new programme, which isn’t going to be patronising and lecturing, but a new programme to help support parents.
And we know that overwhelmingly parents do want support. Nobody’s born with a manual of how to bring up children. Parents want the hints and tips. And so we’re introducing a new programme, which will come out next month to support parents.
We also know the effect the home environment has. We tend to talk about it for the very earliest years but actually it carries all the way through school and indeed beyond. If you take a child who has a combination of a lot of strife at home and parents being disengaged from their education, so not going to parents evening, not reading reports, these children’s attainment is the equivalent of nine grades lower across eight GCSE subjects. And just to put that in perspective, that – the strife at home and disengaged parenting – is a bigger difference , than either being born into a low income household or being at a school rated less than good or outstanding.
So, the most, concentrated form of strife that children may experience when young is this one, Children in Need.It’s not a phrase which is particularly well understood out there. Most people in this room will understand it, but let me just explain what in public policy terms Children in Need means.
These are children who are not children in care, they’re living at home, but they do need the services of a social worker and they either have a Child Protection Plan or a Children in Need plan. And there are five times as many of them as there are Children in Care. Now, this is a group that is not that well understood. I don’t get asked about them when I do media interviews, I don’t answer Parliamentary questions about Children in Need. It is I’m afraid a cohort of children who in general public discourse are just not as well understood as, Children in Care or indeed children overall.
We understand Children in Care, or Looked after Children, have very poor outcomes, very poor attainment at school, compared to other children. Actually the truth is that this group, Children in Need, have outcomes which are almost as bad, I mean, very, very nearly as bad, but there are five times as many of them.
And, if you talk about children who’ve ever been in those circumstances, so they have needed a social worker at some point, that’s 1.6 million children, or to put it in perspective, one in 10.
Now, in our Children in Need Review, we are looking at, or we have been looking at what more can be done to help and support those children, and I’ll come onto that in a minute. As well as knowing that the attainment and the outcomes for Children in Need are very poor, we also know that those effects sustain.
So, even if you are not classed as a Child in Need at the time when you’re doing your qualifications, you can still see that effect coming through. Overall if you’ve needed contact with a social worker at any time, since Year 5 in school, on average you score 20 grades lower across eight GCSEs.
It’s quite an astonishing, gap. And as I say we’ve known, and it’s widely understood, that for Children in Care, so the Looked after Children, there’s a wide gap, but this doesn’t get talked about nearly as much.
So, I said in our Children in Need Review, we’re considering and putting forward, what more we need to do. The first thing we need to do is improve the visibility of this group of children. And that’s true, both for individual schools and for the system as a whole.
In fact, schools in general will know about this group of children, those who are in need of a social worker, because of safeguarding arrangements. But we need to make sure that is true in every case, so that information is passed on when a child moves a school, for example. We also need to make sure that at a system wide level we are tracking the outcomes of these children overall. So, that as we carry on developing policy, we always have this group of children high in our minds. We also need them to be in school.
Now, I mentioned the absence persistence a moment ago, it probably isn’t a great surprise to you to hear that Children in Need are considerably more likely to be persistently absent from school than other children.
And being in school is a key protective factor. It is not just about what you’re learning, but the very fact of being there in school and being around other trusted adults, is very, very important for these children. And helping to reduce the likelihood that they fall prey to criminal or sexual exploitation.
So, we’re going to do a couple of these, including changing the admissions code, so that when a Child in Need has to move schools, so for example in the case of domestic abuse, we’re going to change the admissions code to help accelerate that process. And if one of these children is excluded from school, and we would hope that that is reduced, but if they do have to be excluded from school, we will make sure that their social worker is informed. We also need to continue to improve our knowledge of what works to help and support these children.
We mustn’t lower our expectations to only expect so much, but actually, for these children, it’s more important than anything that they, can do their very, very best, make the very, very most of their talents when they are at school.
And so, we need to learn what works with Looked after Children, Children in Care, for example the virtual school heads’ approach, and see what learning we can derive from that, for this group as well.
And we need to make sure we use that greater knowledge to best effect.
And there of course those many, many different levers, many different things that we can do to help minimise disadvantage, to help to continue to sustain the narrowing of that gap.
And I think this has been a very, very important structural change that we made in education, not only the Pupil Premium but crucially the guidance that goes with it.
And today I thank EEF for publishing the new guidance on effective use of the Pupil Premium, which recommends a tiered approach. It starts with hiring brilliant teachers, because we know that, great teachers make the biggest difference to all children, but an even bigger difference to the most disadvantaged children.
And the second tier is about targeted interventions with particular children, groups of children, and third making sure they have access to the goods and extra curriculum opportunities as other children.
But there are many other things, as I say, that we have done, starting with the institution of the EEF, the increased entitlement to early years’ education and particularly for disadvantaged two-year olds.
The Opportunity Areas, the virtual school heads for children in care, the changing accountability of the performance measures from the cliff edge, five or more GCSEs to the progress measure, which means that the progress and development of every child is counted.
And overall, what we have been doing, and many people actually who I see in this room have been in the forefront of, is school improvement, and making sure that we are impatient for there to be a brilliant education, not just for some kids in our country, but for all kids in our country, and the School Improvement Programme, along with free schools and academies, particularly sponsored academies, has been at the forefront of that.
There are a number of things which we’re at a relatively early stage development, like Opportunity North East, that I mentioned, the careers strategy to make sure that all children have a broad view and a stretching view of what they can achieve in life.
Access and participation – whenever I hear that phrase, access and participation, I always want to insert another word, which is successful, there’s no point in widening access, if people aren’t finishing university, so access and successful participation of higher education. And the home learning environment, where actually it all starts, from that grounding that you get in the very earliest years at home and then that actually gets sustained through life as well. And there will be more to come in the future.
This set of levers may not end up being a fully comprehensive set, there may need to be other things that we do as well. Because until we have closed that gap, until we have ensured that every child can make the absolute fullest use of their talents, there will always be more to do. Thank you.
"
David Blunkett,"I am very pleased to be invited to this celebration for the Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation.
The Institute has become an increasingly influential source of ideas and new approaches in this country and both directly and indirectly in other parts of the world too and has certainly been an important stimulus to my thinking. Over the past 15 years, I have been able to visit some of the programmes growing out of the work of the Institute and its predecessors – including the Compstat system in New York, the Centre for Court Innovation, La Bodega de la Familia and Operation Ceasefire in Boston. I’ve even succeeded intempting one of your distinguished alumni Paul Evans across the Atlantic! And I have had long-standing links with the Kennedy School as a whole through Professor Robert Putnam.
But that is not my theme for today. Does Government matter, what kind of Government and for what purpose? On our side of the Atlantic we have exactly the same debates and challenges: people call for action on every front one day and demand that we devolve responsibility and downscale resources the next.
I’ll come later to the contradictions of a liberal left who want more Government at home and less abroad and the right preaching no Government at home and big Government abroad.
I start from the premise that Government matters, Government is the alternative to anarchy, to disintegration and to conflict. Government is about resolving differences, determining priorities, allocating resources peacefully and without conflict not to mention its more ancient and fundamental role of providing the basic framework of protection from harm necessary for both communities and individuals. One of the first books I read at University was by Professor Sir Bernard Crick, “In Defence of Politics”. I believe that Bernard’s analysis holds good for today.
But the question is not whether we need politics or Government or even good Government, but what kind of Government, what role Government can play in the 21st century and how democracy can be revitalised and renewed in an era of global capital, the world wide web, mobile phones and multi channel media. And of course this leads us into wider questions. What is the glue that holds society together? How do we build on the family, what should we do to reinforce self-reliance and mutuality?
If we are to answer these questions, we must be very clear about the nature of the challenges that now confront us. Above all it seems clear to me that the challenge is one of the most enormous change both in terms of scale but also rapidity. Change economically, socially and globally. Change which can bring enormous benefits to individuals, communities and countries but which can also be threatening for all of these. In particular change which can undermine the cohesion, the social capital, the networks and support structures which are crucial part of every area of human activity – economic, educational and personal and family life. Old certainties have disappeared – but there is no room for nostalgia, we have to develop a new sense of identity and belonging – and government has to look to build new forms of social capital, new networks and new cohesion which will help us all to thrive in the new world in which we find ourselves.
I want therefore to explore for a moment what it is that determines the level of social capital in a society?
It seems to be affected in a negative way by a number of contemporary trends. Firstly, the breakdown of family in the traditional sense which can undermine our sense of where we belong. Secondly, mobility – if you don’t expect to stay long in one place you are unlikely to invest in the social networks that bind communities together. And thirdly, the decay in people’s sense of community can lead to the disintegration of actual communities – with people leaving, crime rising, drug use, and despair which can become a vicious cycle
But of course Government should not be a purely passive player in this. And the steps we are taking – for example to give people and local communities the powers and the confidence to tackle anti-social behaviour – are I believe helping to turn this round. Perhaps more important still for long term change is our approach to education – which brings not just personal strength, hope, and the capacity to cope with change, but also gives people a stake in society. And finally, ownership, financial and material assets, which of course also gives people a stake in society. Research I commissioned while at the Department of Education, using data from the National Child Development Study, suggests that asset ownership brings wider social and psychological benefits. Having savings appears to be correlated with enjoying better health, and having more interest in politics. This applies to community assets as well as individual assets. When physical capital in a community goes up, so too does social capital.
This suggests for me a new and different role for Government. The challenge for government is, by taking a more enabling, facilitating role, to help individuals and communities see a way forward – not by doing things for them but by doing things with them, as a means to lasting change. Leadership is crucial – not just government, but also schools and colleges, churches, community organisations. But without participation, the difference leadership makes will be temporary not permanent. Let me give you some practical examples of precisely this kind of change in the UK.
In London, the Families in Focus initiative at Ampthill Square, Camden, has clearly shown the benefits of involving residents in working with ‘at risk’ children and young people. Anti-social behaviour has fallen sharply. Caretakers estimate that problems of vandalism, graffiti and litter have been cut by 70%. According to the local Council’s lead on anti-social behaviour, “the area went from being well-known for youth anti-social behaviour to being well-known for the lack of it.”
In Birmingham, Balsall Heath, once a blighted red-light area, has been revived by community activists who engaged local residents through 22 self-help associations. House prices have risen and local people are more satisfied with improvements made to their area than other parts of the City.
I know that Britain does not have a monopoly on these kinds of initiatives. In Dudley, one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Boston, and a deteriorating and crime-ridden wasteland in the early 1980s, the area was saved by a civic association that knocked on every door, overcame ethnic differences, and now plays an ongoing role in the neighborhood. At countless community meetings, at multicultural festivals, and through side-by-side labor, organizers helped people in the neighborhood connect and reconnect. A major achievement has been gaining control of unused land, convincing Boston’s city government to give the neighbourhood power of ‘eminent domain’ over various parcels of land. This gave local people greater control of the neighbourhood, and a ‘place at the table’ during discussions surrounding development of their community. More than 300 of the 1,300 abandoned plots of land have been transformed into high quality affordable housing, gardens and public spaces.
This is the kind of control which neighbourhoods should be getting – not the gated, fenced, walled off communities which are a symbol of the importance of security, but also a warning. Once this way of striving for security takes over, society is fractured as those who try to withdraw from perceived danger also withdraw their talents and resources from any attempt to reverse the cycle to which I referred earlier. The flight from the most difficult urban areas denudes the neighbourhood of the capacity to recover and the downward spiral can only be reversed by drastic remedial steps. We end up with a kind of community isolationism.
There are parallels here with the international sphere – where we in the UK, or you here, cannot truly gate-off our countries from terrorism, organised crime and other threats to world stability. Migration, globalisation mean that we need to work together to look for solutions to our common problems. And when the terrorist threat increasingly knows no borders, we have to respond to the threat by reaching out for international solutions rather than retrenching into isolation.
But I want to focus here on the domestic context. Professor Putnam’s work has helped to draw attention to the links between how individuals interact and the wider effects on society. It is essential we continue to refine our understanding of these links and examine more precisely not just the apparent correlations, but the underlying causes. ‘Social capital’ has come to be used to describe a wide range of activities and relationships, from informal volunteering, engagement with civic institutions, to any form of group activities, socialising beyond family members, to community activism. How these are affected by, and in turn affect, other social, economic and political factors require careful but also imaginative thinking. And that’s where we politicians look to the social and political scientists like you for help.
In Britain in the last few weeks, there has been a good deal of controversy about the related issue of whether the left should really believe in diversity, if it makes other progressive values, like redistribution and the welfare state, more difficult to pursue. Here in the US, I know that Professor Putnam – while not questioning the value of diversity – does believe that some on the left underestimate the challenges it presents, in terms of its effects on social capital.
There are those on the left in Britain have reacted in a way which suggests that it is dangerous even to raise these questions. My own view is that we need to be rigorously honest so that the debate is one worth having. The idea that there is a potential tension between supporting diversity and other progressive aims, is not a new one – it goes back at least to Friedrich Engels. And the evidence that diversity is correlated with a decline in social capital is sufficiently powerful – both in the US and in the UK, through work carried out by MORI – that we need to address it. For my part, as I have said, I am convinced that instability through high mobility and therefore turnover of population is a central factor in contributing to the decline in social capital. I have an open mind as to whether diversity of itself has a similar impact but the important thing is that I am convinced that we can combine diversity with integration and therefore with stability, leading to a greater capacity to manage difference. The sense of belonging and identification clearly matters.
In Britain we’ve just introduced a proper ceremony for naturalisation purposes, whereas you have had them for 100 years. The ceremonies will be firmly anchored in the local communities. These symbols are important – but of course they can only support, not replace, hard-edged action at local level. The example I gave earlier, of Balsall Heath, shows how communities with real problems – and also diversity, whether or not that is related – can turn themselves around, with help from government help, and rebuild their social networks, and with that tolerance and ultimately, mutuality. As well as Balsall Heath, parts of London display the same kind of virtuous circle – with minority groups for example often involved in the most active and open church organisations – whilst in other communities elsewhere, for example in the North of England, diversity has taken a different route, with segregation leading ultimately to fracture. We need to understand why. We need to think about how the experiences which have worked can be shared and replicated across other local areas – without losing the vital sense of connection with particular local energy and concerns.
I promised earlier to deal with the contradictions of a liberal left who want more Government at home and less abroad and the right preaching no Government at home and big Government abroad. There is also the paradox that those in favour of no government are usually quick to recognise the potential of government in terms of awarding contracts, when it comes to an election.
But I realise this is a caricature. There are genuine disagreements over the value and scope of government. Instead of choosing between a picture of a government which does everything for us or a government which prides itself on trying not to do anything, we need to move towards a new compact between government and governed. This means responsibilities and duties resting with the individual and community as well as with the Government, the politics of something-for-something, with rights and responsibilities going hand in hand. This is an extension of the family, where mutual help has to be balanced by willingness to self-help. But self-help is impossible in many circumstances without mutual help – and without a more equal distribution of resources and opportunities. We are struggling to address this, not just in re-shaping the relationship between Government and governed but in defining where accountability should lie.
This is about hard-edged policy in capacity-building for civil renewal and for youth engagement – and for making the link between the political and civil aspects of democracy. All the evidence shows that those with assets engage, those who engage also vote, those who vote influence, those who are very wealthy have the most influence. But crucially those who do not engage and do not vote have little or no influence. Their lack of both alienates them from broader engagement with society as well as from the formal decision-making process. And those, including those in the media, who foster cynicism and preach doctrines which alienate are never the ones who disengage themselves, they know better! But when people disengage, especially those who most need help, the public domain is drained of legitimacy.
Which brings me back to my original theme or question – why do we need Government? Well, we invented government because we had to, not just for defending ourselves and guaranteeing our protection and security, but also because we amount to more, we achieve more, if we work in common rather than as isolated individuals. This is why government is still needed today – because left purely to individual choice we will not invest enough in social capital, and not in a co-ordinated enough way, to respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing world.
So Government is about making things possible, by sharing resources, including where gross inequality prevents any sense of community, and by fostering a public space which is inhabitable by us all – and here I mean not just the physical space, but also the space of opportunities and life chances, together with the ability to grasp those life chances, the ability to be independent, self-reliant and self-determining.
I believe that this way of understanding what government is about transcends traditional political divides. The choice is not between being “on your own”, or “under the dead hand of Government” – it is whether government, which must exist and will always affect people’s lives, can do so in a way that enables them both as individuals and as communities.
There are areas in our lives where we offer to share sovereignty and invest together because individually we could never realise our goals and values. Not just obvious areas like defence, but also public education, social capital and the settling of differences. In other words, the different ways in which we socialise our civic and democratic sphere. Without that ability to inhabit a shared public space, we have dysfunctional communities and dysfunctional states. With it we have the chance of a civilised democracy which is as much about participation as it is about primaries and Presidential elections.
"
Mike DeWine,"… They’ve weighed prescription copays, removed in network and out-of-network pharmacy distinctions and relaxed prior authorization requirements for most procedures.
Today we are going another step. Our administration is submitting its first waiver application to the federal government which is known as 1135 or Appendix K application to provide needed flexibility to address this crisis. Among other things, this waiver will allow us to do the following: one, bolster telehealth and other technology to be used to do health assessments and care planning; second, waive signature requirements for a variety of providers to ensure safe distancing without compromising access to care; three, ease obstacles to access nursing home care; four, allow services to be provided at alternative locations and, five, removing staffing level requirements to get providers more flexibility to deliver the services.
Once we get federal approval of this waiver, which we hope we will, it will go back retroactively from March 1st, 2020. Removing restrictions like these during this pandemic will allow healthcare workers to focus on meeting the needs of their fellow Ohioans. Our director, when we get to questions, will be on the line. Marine Corcoran will be on the line if anyone has any specific questions about that waiver.
We’re very fortunate today to be joined by Mayor Andy Ginther. I don’t know whether Andy, you’re up there yet or not. Andy, how you doing? Mayor?
It’s good to see you.
The mayor is in our call every day at 11:30, where we talk to many of the mayors of the state. I just want to thank Mayor Ginther, but also every other Mayor, big and small sized communities, because they’ve been very, very helpful as we go through this. They’ve been our eyes and ears out there and reporting what they’re seeing, what we can do better and what we’re not doing well. These conversations are really very, very helpful, I know to me, and I think they’re probably also sure helpful to the people of the State of Ohio in that we come up with better policies.
The Mayor and I first … We’ve worked together on a number of things over the years, but probably the most difficult thing we had to work on was the Arnold Classic. Mayor, that was not an easy decision for any of us and it was early on in this epidemic. We had to make the decision not to have spectators there, which was a very, very difficult decision.
The Mayor’s going to talk about anything he wants to today, but one of the things I know he’s going to talk about is the build out as we work to make sure that we have the hospital capacity in the state of Ohio.
Mayor, before you talk about what you’re doing, I just want to read through what some other communities are doing. In Cleveland, Case Western University’s health education campus is the place where that build out is occurring. The Duke Energy Convention Center is where it is in Hamilton County. Those two coupled with the greater Columbus Convention Center in Franklin County are seeing activity go on just to make sure that this epidemic does not flood our hospitals to the point where they no longer have space. Candidly, we hope we never have to use these. The good work that all the citizens of Ohio are doing is really, really making a difference.
The other locations that we talked about, we announced the location of three additional sites and we’re really holding these in reserve if they should be needed. This is Seagate Convention Center in Lucas County, the Dayton Convention Center in Montgomery County and Cavelli Convention Center in the Mahoney County as well. Healthcare regions in Southern Ohio and Southeast Ohio have determined the existing hospital facilities in their areas will, with additional equipment, be able to handle the surge and patients without going to an offsite location.
Mayor, we will turn it over to you. How are things going in that regard and anything else you want to share with with us today?
Well Mayor, thank you very much. That is inspirational and hopeful, but it’s also, I think you laid out very well really what our charge is and the challenges that we face. I personally look forward to continuing to work with you and the other mayors around the state in that partnership. It’s been a great partnership and so far so good in the sense that we’ve been able to slow this, put this curve down, and now we’re planning to how we start back up. I look forward to working with the Mayor.
Congratulations to you and your team for putting that together in two weeks. That’s quite amazing. As you say, let’s hope we don’t have to use it.
Thanks, Mayor. We appreciate it.
Lieutenant Governor?
Lieutenant Governor, thank you. Dr. Acton?
Dr. Acton, thank you very much. We will take some questions. Again, for those of you who are at home, what we’re looking at is a TV screen, and I see Jim Otte coming up here. Everybody in the press corps it looks like, media has a mask of some sort on. Mr. Otte has his. Is that homemade, Mr. Otte?
All right, very good. You get the first question.
I’ll start.
I’ve had Bill’s Donuts a number of times, and we look forward to having them again. Look, we apologize to those 46 folks there. The Lieutenant Governor and I were talking about this literally before we walked in, and we’re going to be continuing to talk with our team about it at our five o’clock call today. So I’ll refer it to the Lieutenant Governor, but let me just say, this is something that is very concerning, is very upsetting to me, and we can go through all the reasons why that is happening, but the bottom line for those of you who are not getting your check or you weren’t able to get into the system, I don’t think you want to hear anything. I think what you want us to do is fix it, and I hear you, and Lieutenant Governor hears you, and we’re going to do everything we can to fix it.
Thanks, Jim.
Well, I’ll start off. I think it’s much too early to be making any decisions about fall. I don’t think we know enough. I don’t think we know where we’re going to be. I don’t think we know how many tests that we will have.
But what I think we do know is that whether it’s a business, whether it is a college, whether it is K through 12, whenever they do open again, it’s going to be different. And I think that’s the thing that I want to get across to people based on everything that I know. And this is the hardest thing for me to accept, and so I suspect it’s hard for other people to accept, but until there is a vaccine, this monster, as I’ve referred to it, is going to be the lurking around us. And so when we start businesses back up, when we start schools back up, when we start colleges back up, it’s going to be different.
And what everybody needs to be thinking about, and this is to every business out there that is chomping at the bit to reopen, it’s to every university, every college, every superintendent, you need to be thinking, “How am I going to open? What am I going to do every single day to keep my employees safe, my customers safe, my students safe, my faculty safe, my teachers safe?” And we’re going to work with you on that. But that’s something that you should be thinking about right now because the when is one question but how is the bigger question because you’re going to open up with a situation that is not ideal. That is far, far from ideal. Coronavirus is still, as far as we can tell, still going to be very much here, is still going to be, for some people who get it, deadly.
It is odd that we look at, for the last week, and we think there’s good news and it is good news in a sense that the hospital admissions are sort of flat. Up until today, the deaths had been not going up much. But the truth is, we lost 50 people in the last 24 hours. 50 of our citizens died. So this is a very, very dangerous situation. I still have people who send me emails who say this is like the flu. I wish it was. It’s not. And so we all work on this and we’re working on it every day, businesses working on it every day.
But the real question is, what are you going to do different? What are we going to do different? Dr Acton talked about the masks. Businesses are going to be having their employees wear these. It’s going to be different. I can’t imagine a business that’s going to open up without employees all wearing one of these. Many, many other changes.
I talked to someone I know, Eastern part of the state of Ohio late yesterday afternoon. I talked to him for a while, called him up, see how he’s doing, how’s his business. His is an essential business, a manufacturing company. And he told me, I said, “Well, how you doing?” And he went through and told me every safety precaution that they had taken. It was quite expansive. I was kind of blown away by all that he had done. So it’s that type of drilling down and trying to be as safe as we can that everyone is going to have to do. Whatever your business is, you’re going to have to figure that out.
And so long answer, and I apologize for the long answer, but that’s what universities are going to have to think about whenever they open. That’s what K through 12 is going to have to think about. How do you do that? These are difficult questions. They’re not easy.
Sure. We’re not going to make that announcement today. We’re going to be consulting with members of the general assembly as we have been talking with them, but we will in the next few days have announced what we’re going to do. As far as what is essential, as far as what’s needed to fight the coronavirus, that’ll obviously is going to be a very, very high high on the list of priorities. You have to take care of business. You have to take care of that. So we’ll have some announcements in the next few days.
Very, very important. Companies are doing some of that themselves where they can. We are doing what we can. We have a team that is focused on the personal protection equipment, for example, which is so essential to our first responders, so essential to people in nursing homes who are working, people in hospitals. And so we kind of break that down to the different things that we are trying to get into Ohio, the ventilators and the other things that we hear about on the news and every state is trying to do. Sometimes that’s frustrating. Sometimes that is, you think you’ve got something bought and you don’t have it bought and it doesn’t show up.
So these are very difficult times. We have really turned to Ohio companies and Ohio manufacturers. They have stepped up. They’re doing absolutely some amazing work. I’ll let Jon talk a little bit about… He’s been working with some of these companies in regard to what they are doing.
But Andy, it’s the right question, and part of coming back and being able to have businesses reopen is they got to have whatever safety protection that they need. I mean, we’re working on this, but I envision, as Dr. Acton indicated, that everybody in this state will have a couple of these masks that when you go out into public, you can use those. Certainly people in businesses. So this is something that I know the private sector is working on. We are working on as well. Jon, you want to add anything?
Well, my experience in life is the private sector usually can do things better than the public sector. And so a lot of this is going to be driven by what the private sector can do both in sourcing it, finding it, but also in producing it. But we’re certainly encouraging. We’re trying to help manufacturers who are producing essential things in the state of Ohio.
And when those work well, they can work exceedingly well. But I mean, every company’s got to figure out what do I need, but there are common things that we know have to be there, kind of basic things, the masks that certainly can and are being produced, and the hand sanitizer. Some of the other things are unique to that particular business.
Now over all, in regard to that, we know we’re going to be safer if we, as we open back up, if we have the ability to do a lot more testing. And so that’s something that is within, we have some control over. Our great hospitals in Ohio, who are doing phenomenal job, they’re leading the way in this testing. So more we can help them, the more robust our testing can be, the more safer the workplaces can be, the better that we can trace when… If there’s an outbreak somewhere, it’d be able to trace that and to quarantine and do all the things that we know that have to be done. And the government certainly plays a significant role in that, particularly in regard to the 113 health departments around the state. They’re certainly involved in that.
We have the capacity today in Ohio to get tests returned quickly. If somebody is not getting it returned quickly, there is a problem that we need to fix. We have capacity. So if that sample is taken and it’s not getting back quickly, there’s something wrong, and we would love to know about it and try to run that down and figure out what’s wrong.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, look. If it’s a day, that’s one thing. It was five days, that’s something else, and that’s not helpful to anybody if there’s that delay.
Well Ben, once again, you’ve hit the tough question, but a very, very good question. I think that we all need to understand, and this is so hard to accept, Ohioans, Americans, we’re used to going in and winning and then leaving and, “We did it. And so let’s move on to life.” But as Dr. Acton said, we’ve won a battle, but we’ve not won the war. And so, this monster is still going to be with us at least until we get a vaccine.
So I think the answer to the question is people have to be very, very careful. If you’re 80 years old and you have asthma, you’re probably not going to go see the Reds play until we get a vaccine. I mean, you can, but you got to weigh benefit versus risk. And of course, that’s my example: baseball. So that’s what I want to get back to.
So I think that everybody’s going to have to make their own calculations. I think what we have to do is to make sure we’re doing certain things: people wearing a mask when they go out, trying to if you have a job, that company doing everything they can to do not only the social distancing, but doing all the other things that are necessary to make that person’s job safer.
But it’s not going away. I mean, that’s the sad news. Most things in life, we think we can deal with, but it’s not going away until we get a vaccines. So we’re 12 to 18 months away from this going away. We’re going to have to live with it, but we’re going to have to, everybody’s either both collectively as a state, 11.7 million people in state government plus individuals, we’re all going to have to make rational decisions and rational choices and not think that this thing is over with. Because when we open things more up, people are still going to be exceedingly, exceedingly careful.
Well, I’m frustrated just like every Ohioan is, and I understand that frustration. We have an obligation to get to a point where we can start doing some things, opening up in regard to business. But I would say this, that if I stood up here right now and said, People let’s go do whatever you want to do,” if people are still afraid, they’re not going to go to restaurants. If people are afraid, they’re not going to go to bars. Oh, some will, but the vast majority of people will not. And so what we have to do, if we want our economy to pick back up, if we…
… want people to be able to be employed, we have to be as deliberate, and careful, and thoughtful about getting out of this as we were when we had to make the decisions to close things down. This part of it is frankly much more difficult, but that’s what we owe the people, I owe as governor, the people of the state of Ohio, is a thoughtful response in how we do that. I also owe them the truth and one things is I’ve been saying today is it will not be like it was. It will not be like it was until we get a vaccine. What we have to do is do the best we can.
We’ve seen some progress, even though 50 people died, 50 of our fellow citizens died within the last 24 hours. We have flattened this thing out it looks like. We’ve got in about a week, and we’ll see if this trend continues, and then what we hope is at some point we start going down and the number of people hospitalized go down eventually. The number of people who die is going down. It’s going down like that. I share their frustration. I share their anger, I get it, but it’s not going to do businesses any good. It’s not going to do employees any good if we get it wrong. If we get it wrong, we’re going to have a medical mess, at the same time, we’re going to continue to have a mess in the economy.
The best thing we can do is get this right layout, what our steps are. I’ve talked about some of the things today that every business has got to figure out, and we’ll help them. Our health department will help them, but figuring out all the things that you can do that make it safer for your employees. Because the truth is if employees don’t feel safe, they won’t want to come to work either. Everyone’s got to feel safe and we’ve got to work our way through this. I get it. We’re going to have to do what we think is right and we’re going to have to do it the right way.
Well, we hope not. Look, we know that, as they were saying, the stock market, this is deaths tragically are lagging. They lag. Your hospital admissions lags obviously from where the person got infected. But the hospital admissions are earlier in the process, and they’re probably a better indicator of what’s happening. We saw it go back up on deaths. I think the thing to focus on is your hospital admissions. See how those go.
Understanding that people are staying longer in hospital from COVID-19 than they are normally. It doesn’t mean your hospital capacity stays the same, that continues to change, but if you keep the same numbers, you’re going to have more people in there. But we’re seeing a flattening of that curve in regard to hospitalizations, which is a good thing. It’s like any data, it’s like looking at the stock market, or anything else you know, don’t look at one day. What you want to look at is a five day average or seven day average and just see, and that’s what we look at every day. We compare that. You’ll see one of the graphs up there, Dr. Acton has it tells you the data for that day, but then it’s got the last five days. That gives you the trend and that’s what we really think is the most important thing.
Okay. Dr Actton you have that one?
I will tell you, I get numbers, we get numbers late at night when I get the full numbers in, but those numbers actually switch at 11:00 AM, is that the reporting time? 11:00 AM. Sometimes I’ve come in here actually and been looking at yesterday’s number. I’m not saying that’s where this time, but I was looking … one time, I know I came in here and I was looking at the numbers I had that morning, but didn’t have the update as far as 11:00 AM. I don’t know how to explain this and we’ll figure it out for you.
Well, I’ll start on that. First of all, thank God the numbers are better than the modeling. That’s number one. Number two, modeling is what it is. It is an attempt at some prediction based on the information that they have at that time. If you look at some of the earlier models that had the highest numbers and the scariest numbers, it certainly scared me. The early ones were based on virtually no social distancing, basically doing nothing.
Every other model, when you drill down on it, they have to project what they think the social distancing cut will be. Is at 20% down? 40%? 60%? Wherever they set that, I’m not a modeler, but it does impact what the results are. At this point, what you look at is the real data day to day. That’s what I’m looking at every day. I’m looking at a five day average. I’m trying to see where it’s going. That’s what I’m dealing with.
I don’t know either one. I think I’ve said this before. I told our son Brian who runs a minor league baseball team in Asheville, North Carolina. I told him a month ago, I said if we’re playing ball in July, we’ll be lucky. But I don’t know. I don’t think anybody knows. I think baseball is going to … major league baseball is making decisions. I’ve read in the Dayton Daily News and other papers, your paper, Laura, about different proposals major league was having about playing in Arizona. Or playing in Florida, and trying to seal everybody off. All I know in regard to that as is what I read. I would say that as you look at any kind of coming back, that large gatherings of people are going to be the last thing that you check off the box and say, “Okay, we should be doing that.”
Again, I think that it’s not going to be what the States do only, it’s going to be what fans think is safe. What do restaurant customers think is safe? What do people go to bars think is safe? You go to a Reds game, you think that’s safe? That is our challenge, and the state’s challenge is to do everything we can possible to make people feel safe, and it be true that it be safer in regard to whatever activity they’re engaged in, whether that’s a business activity or whether that is, in going to a sporting event. I wish I knew the answer to your question. I don’t.
Lawyers have to be involved. I’m sorry to say, Randy.
Lawyers have to be involved unfortunately. We love lawyers. I am one.
We’ve also indicated that this is what people should be doing, and we fully expect they’re going to do it. Yes, that will be signed.
Well, we don’t have any formal plan, nor do we have any formal coalition. I have talked a lot to the governors of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan. Talked some to the governor of Pennsylvania, West Virginia. The States around us, we have a lot in common, and it just make sense for us to share information. It’s interesting you asked that because this morning the first thing I did on my conference call this morning was tell our team, make sure we’re reaching out to these different teams the governors have.
Dr Acton, is in touch with the health departments of those different States. I told my chief of staff, Laurel Dawson, I said, “Let’s make sure that we’re really … you guys at your level are doing it. We’re doing it the governor’s level, and we do it quite frequently.” I was on a call last night with Republican governors. I was on a call with the vice president with all the governors. Last Friday night I had a call with the governor of Kentucky and Indiana, the three of us got together on the phone. We’re doing that once a week. We’re always looking for good ideas and we’re always looking at how to share information.
Well, as we close, just a comment. Last summer I had the opportunity to attend the special Olympics. Jesse Owens, a stadium at Ohio State University. It was great to see the athletes. It was just a very, very inspiring time that I had there. Obviously, because of what we’re going through this year, unfortunately there will not be a summer games.
However, Special Olympics, Ohio has launched a virtual program that includes content such as fitness routines, resources for both physical and mental health, and nutrition information for the athletes. Lieutenant governor and I and Dr Acton received a special message from one of their athletes. I’d like to share it with you. This is from Jessica. Jessica, I’m going to butcher your last name, but it’s K-O-M-J-A-T-I. Jessica, thank you very, very much, and we’re going to share your message with everybody in Ohio.
Jessica, thank you very much and we look forward to seeing you compete next summer, and all the other special Olympics athletes. We’ll see you all at two o’clock tomorrow. Thank you.
"
Harry S. Truman,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress:
It is with a heavy heart that I stand before you, my friends and colleagues, in the Congress of the United States.
Only yesterday, we laid to rest the mortal remains of our beloved President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At a time like this, words are inadequate. The most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence.
Yet, in this decisive hour, when world events are moving so rapidly, our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemies.
In His infinite wisdom, Almighty God has seen fit to take from us a great man who loved, and was beloved by, all humanity.
No man could possibly fill the tremendous void left by the passing of that noble soul. No words can ease the aching hearts of untold millions of every race, creed and color. The world knows it has lost a heroic champion of justice and freedom.
Tragic fate has thrust upon us grave responsibilities. We must carry on. Our departed leader never looked backward. He looked forward and moved forward. That is what he would want us to do. That is what America will do.
So much blood has already been shed for the ideals which we cherish, and for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt lived and died, that we dare not permit even a momentary pause in the hard fight for victory.
Today, the entire world is looking to America for enlightened leadership to peace and progress. Such a leadership requires vision, courage and tolerance. It can be provided only by a united nation deeply devoted to the highest ideals.
With great humility I call upon all Americans to help me keep our nation united in defense of those ideals which have been so eloquently proclaimed by Franklin Roosevelt.
I want in turn to assure my fellow Americans and all of those who love peace and liberty throughout the world that I will support and defend those ideals with all my strength and all my heart. That is my duty and I shall not shirk it.
So that there can be no possible misunderstanding, both Germany and Japan can be certain, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that America will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance remains!
We are deeply conscious of the fact that much hard fighting is still ahead of us.
Having to pay such a heavy price to make complete victory certain, America will never become a party to any plan for partial victory!
To settle for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize the future security of all the world.
Our demand has been, and it remains -- Unconditional Surrender!
We will not traffic with the breakers of the peace on the terms of the peace.
The responsibility for making of the peace--and it is a very grave responsibility -- must rest with the defenders of the peace. We are not unconscious of the dictates of humanity. We do not wish to see unnecessary or unjustified suffering. But the laws of God and of man have been violated and the guilty must not go unpunished. Nothing shall shake our determination to punish the war criminals even though we must pursue them to the ends of the earth.
Lasting peace can never be secured if we permit our dangerous opponents to plot future wars with impunity at any mountain retreat -- however distant.
In this shrinking world, it is futile to seek safety behind geographical barriers. Real security will be found only in law and in justice.
Here in America, we have labored long and hard to achieve a social order worthy of our great heritage. In our time, tremendous progress has been made toward a really democratic way of life. Let me assure the forward-looking people of America that there will be no relaxation in our efforts to improve the lot of the common people.
In the difficult days ahead, unquestionably we shall face problems of staggering proportions. However, with the faith of our fathers in our hearts, we do not fear the future.
On the battlefields, we have frequently faced overwhelming odds -- and won! At home, Americans will not be less resolute!
We shall never cease our struggle to preserve and maintain our American way of life.
At this moment, America, along with her brave Allies, is paying again a heavy price for the defense of our freedom. With characteristic energy, we are assisting in the liberation of entire nations. Gradually, the shackles of slavery are being broken by the forces of freedom.
All of us are praying for a speedy victory. Every day peace is delayed costs a terrible toll.
The armies of liberation today are bringing to an end Hitler's ghastly threat to dominate the world. Tokyo rocks under the weight of our bombs.
The grand strategy of the United Nations' war has been determined -- due in no small measure to the vision of our departed Commander in Chief. We are now carrying out our part of that strategy under the able direction of Admiral Leahy, General Marshall, Admiral King, General Arnold, General Eisenhower, Admiral Nimitz and General MacArthur.
I want the entire world to know that this direction must and will remain -- unchanged and unhampered!
Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget their sacrifices. Because of these sacrifices, the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon.
Our forefathers came to our rugged shores in search of religious tolerance, political freedom and economic opportunity. For those fundamental rights, they risked their lives. We well know today that such rights can be preserved only by constant vigilance, the eternal price of liberty!
Within an hour after I took the oath of office, I announced that the San Francisco Conference would proceed. We will face the problems of peace with the same courage that we have faced and mastered the problems of war.
In the memory of those who have made the supreme sacrifice -- in the memory of our fallen President -- we shall not fail!
It is not enough to yearn for peace. We must work, and if necessary, fight for it. The task of creating a sound international organization is complicated and difficult. Yet, without such organization, the rights of man on earth cannot be protected. Machinery for the just settlement of international differences must be found. Without such machinery, the entire world will have to remain an armed camp. The world will be doomed to deadly conflict, devoid of hope for real peace.
Fortunately, people have retained hope for a durable peace. Thoughtful people have always had faith that ultimately justice must triumph. Past experience surely indicates that, without justice, an enduring peace becomes impossible.
In bitter despair, some people have come to believe that wars are inevitable. With tragic fatalism, they insist that wars have always been, of necessity, and of necessity wars always will be. To such defeatism, men and women of good will must not and can not yield. The outlook for humanity is not so hopeless.
During the dark hours of this horrible war, entire nations were kept going by something intangible -- hope! When warned that abject submission offered the only salvation against overwhelming power, hope showed the way to victory.
Hope has become the secret weapon of the forces of liberation!
Aggressors could not dominate the human mind. As long as hope remains, the spirit of man will never be crushed.
But hope alone was not and is not sufficient to avert war. We must not only have hope but we must have faith enough to work with other peace-loving nations to maintain the peace. Hope was not enough to beat back the aggressors as long as the peace-loving nations were unwilling to come to each other's defense. The aggressors were beaten back only when the peace-loving nations united to defend themselves.
If wars in the future are to be prevented the nations must be united in their determination to keep the peace under law.
Nothing is more essential to the future peace of the world than continued cooperation of the nations which had to muster the force necessary to defeat the conspiracy of the Axis powers to dominate the world.
While these great states have a special responsibility to enforce the peace, their responsibility is based upon the obligations resting upon all states, large and small, not to use force in international relations except in the defense of law. The responsibility of the great states is to serve and not to dominate the world.
To build a foundation of enduring peace we must not only work in harmony with our friends abroad, but we must have the united support of our own people.
Even the most experienced pilot cannot bring a ship safely into harbor, unless he has the full cooperation of the crew. For the benefit of all, every individual must do his duty.
I appeal to every American, regardless of party, race, creed, or color, to support our efforts to build a strong and lasting United Nations Organization.
You, the Members of the Congress, surely know how I feel. Only with your help can I hope to complete one of the greatest tasks ever assigned to a public servant. With Divine guidance, and your help, we will find the new passage to a far better world, a kindly and friendly world, with just and lasting peace.
With confidence, I am depending upon all of you.
To destroy greedy tyrants with dreams of world domination, we cannot continue in successive generations to sacrifice our finest youth.
In the name of human decency and civilization, a more rational method of deciding national differences must and will be found!
America must assist suffering humanity back along the path of peaceful progress. This will require time and tolerance. We shall need also an abiding faith in the people, the kind of faith and courage which Franklin Delano Roosevelt always had!
Today, America has become one of the most powerful forces for good on earth. We must keep it so. We have achieved a world leadership which does not depend solely upon our military and naval might.
We have learned to fight with other nations in common defense of our freedom. We must now learn to live with other nations for our mutual good. We must learn to trade more with other nations so that there may be for our mutual advantage -- increased production, increased employment and better standards of living throughout the world.
May we Americans all live up to our glorious heritage.
In that way, America may well lead the world to peace and prosperity.
At this moment, I have in my heart a prayer. As I have assumed my heavy duties, I humbly pray Almighty God, in the words of King Solomon:
""Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?""
I ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my Lord and my people.

Gregory Barker,"It was a real pleasure to welcome the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. David Cameron here and to hear his ringing endorsement of the UK Energy Efficiency Mission and I share his passion and commitment.
We want the UK to be the most energy efficient economy in Europe, not because it is nice to have but because it is an essential part of how the UK is going to compete in the global race, how we are going to have competitive onshore manufacturing and rebuild our industrial base.
This is all about competition. This is all about growing efficiency, not just in the energy sector but as part of a holistic approach to the efficiency of the wider economy.
But there is a problem that the Prime Minister put his finger on, and that we hope to deal with this afternoon. The fact of the matter is that we have a host of policies; arguably we even have too many policies dealing with energy efficiency. Yet despite that, historically, energy efficiency has been ignored, relegated to second tier status by successive governments for decades. And that has to change.
I am very proud that this Coalition Government has actually recognised that fact and one of the first things that I did coming into government was to ensure that energy efficiency was actually properly recognised in the architecture of the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change.
It was extraordinary to me to get there and find that we had an Office for the Deployment of Renewables; that there was an Office for New Nuclear; that there is obviously a big oil and gas office there. But energy efficiency was dispersed piecemeal throughout the Department and there was nobody actually at the top table speaking up for energy efficiency alongside the other key elements of energy policy and the energy future.
Now under David Purdy we have the Energy Efficiency Deployment Office, at last recognised within DECC as a vital part of our future policy framework. Within that I have also got to pay tribute to Tracy Vegro who has been responsible for deploying the Green Deal, the most transformational, consumer-facing energy efficiency policy we have ever tried and which will, unlike other markets in the past, be bringing in not a monopoly provider or a monopoly contract but a whole host of new market entrants; opening up choice not just to people with big wallets but to people in the lowest docile of the economy; bringing choice to the fuel poor; bringing much needed competition to the sector to drive down cost.
But there is more to energy efficiency than just the Green Deal, whether that is the Green Deal for consumers or businesses. If you look at the shopping list of our policies, as you will know, we also have the CRC, we have enhanced capital allowances, there are climate change agreements, and there is – although we still need to see a much stronger price signal – an emissions trading scheme at the EU level.
I have mentioned the Green Deal, I have also mentioned the £1.3 billion of subsidy which comes from the Energy Company Obligation – ECO – a vital partner to the Green Deal. There is the Smart Meters Programme which is going to transform the customer relationship with electricity.
We are absolutely determined that future energy markets will actually see energy efficiency recognised within EMR, we see energy efficiency always being the first policy call of choice when it is the cheapest option and we are proactively exploring the way which we can reflect that in the new architecture of the UK electricity market. That means not just electricity demand reduction, it also means demand response which will completely change the way that consumers will interact with their electricity provider.
We have issued strengthen guidance for local authorities under the Home Energy Conservation Act and we have of course our own commitments as a Government that is proud to be walking the walk. We met our 10% target on reducing the energy consumption of the central Government’s real estate – in fact we smashed through it and now we are on track to deliver a 25% cut by 2015 – a really big, meaningful reduction.
But exactly as the Prime Minister said, there is a recognition that the sum of the parts adds up to considerably more than the whole. And the idea for a National Energy Efficiency Mission, to pull all these strands together, to pull in all the key participants in the energy efficiency economy, was actually something that really came to me when I was having a discussion with Andrew Liveris, the global CEO of the Dow Chemical Company, at the Olympics business event.
I had been an admirer of Andrew’s for some time after reading his book, ‘Make it in America’. Where he says is that it is no coincidence that those countries which are resurgent in terms of manufacturing and are increasing their global share of manufactured goods worldwide, are also those countries with an increasing focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy. Actually, the two represent two sides of the same coin and that actually here is a pro business, pro-entrepreneurial, pro-innovation, pro-manufacturing, low carbon agenda which is a huge opportunity we simply cannot afford to miss.
I was discussing this with Andrew and in the course of our conversation, I went through that shopping list of efficiency policies which I previously mentioned and he had no idea. Not only did he not know about the Green Deal, he did not know about the Green Investment Bank, he did not know about the measures that we are putting in place to drive the ESCO market, he did not know about the priority that efficiency has in our ring-fenced science research and development programme, or the fantastic work that the TSB is doing.
There is so much to this ambitious, exciting agenda – but if we are honest, we are just not telling the story effectively. But in order to get it out there, in order to pull it together, we need that backing from the very top of Government and that is why it was absolutely essential that the Prime Minister was here, to launch that mission and articulate this ambition to make the UK the most energy efficiency economy in Europe and to make clear the absolute connection between reducing our carbon emissions and winning that global race that he so frequently refers to.
So we are unapologetic in saying that energy efficiency is a win-win agenda. There is a lot more we need to do to achieve our goals and over the course of the afternoon I hope we can explore in the working groups some new solutions of how we can pull this all together. I want to get maximum bang for British industry buck, maximum bang for the consumer, make sure that those benefits that come with energy efficiency actually cascade down, right the way through to peoples bills.
This is a bold, pro growth agenda and working together we can make it happen.
"
Barack Obama,"Hello, everybody. Hello, hello.
Hello, everybody. In a couple hours, I’ll be departing on my final foreign trip as President. And while we’re abroad, I’ll have a chance to take a few of your questions, but I figured why wait? I know that there’s a lot of domestic issues that people are thinking about, so I wanted to see if I could clear out some of the underbrush so that when we're overseas, and people are asking about foreign policy questions, people don't feel obliged to tack on three other questions to them.
Let me -- I know you still will. That I'm aware, but I'm trying something out here. First of all, let me mention three brief topics.
First of all, as I discussed with the President-elect on Thursday, my team stands ready to accelerate in the next steps that are required to ensure a smooth transition. And we are going to be staying in touch as we travel. I remember what it was like when I came in eight years ago. It is a big challenge. This office is bigger than any one person. And that’s why ensuring a smooth transition is so important.
It’s not something that the Constitution explicitly requires, but it is one of those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy -- similar to norms of civility and tolerance, and a commitment to reason and to facts and analysis. It's part of what makes this country work. And as long as I’m President, we are going to uphold those norms and cherish and uphold those ideals.
As I’ve told my staff, we should be very proud that their work has already ensured that when we turn over the keys the car is in pretty good shape. We are indisputably in a stronger position today than we were when I came in eight years ago. Jobs have been growing for 73 straight months. Incomes are rising. Poverty is falling. The uninsured rate is at the lowest level on record. Carbon emissions have come down without impinging on our growth.
And so my instructions to my team are that we run through the tape. We make sure that we finish what we started, that we don't let up in these last couple of months, because my goal is, on January 21st, America is in the strongest position possible and hopefully there’s an opportunity for the next President to build on that.
Number two, our work has also helped to stabilize the global economy. And because there is one President at a time, I’ll spend this week reinforcing America’s support for the approaches that we’ve taken to promote economic growth and global security on a range of issues.
I look forward to my first visit in Greece. And then, in Germany, I’ll visit with Chancellor Merkel, who’s probably been my closest international partner these past eight years. I’ll also signal our solidarity with our closest allies, and express our support for a strong, integrated, and united Europe. It’s essential to our national security and it's essential to global stability. And that’s why the Transatlantic Alliance and the NATO Alliance have endured for decades under Democratic and Republican Administrations.
Finally, in Peru, I’ll meet with the leaders of countries that have been the focus of our foreign policy through our rebalance in the Asia Pacific. This is a time of great change in the world. But America has always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe. And that’s what it must continue to be.
Finally, on a personal note, Michelle and I want to offer our deepest condolences to Gwen Ifill’s family and to all of you, her colleagues, on her passing. Gwen was a friend of ours. She was an extraordinary journalist. She always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession -- asking tough questions, holding people in power accountable, and defending a strong and free press that makes our democracy work.
I always appreciated Gwen’s reporting, even when I was at the receiving end of one of her tough and thorough interviews. Whether she reported from a convention floor or from the field, whether she sat at the debate moderator’s table or at the anchor desk, she not only informed today’s citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow’s journalists. She was an especially powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity, and her intellect -- and for whom she blazed a trail as one-half of the first all-female anchor team on network news.
So Gwen did her country a great service. Michelle and I join her family and her colleagues, and everybody else who loved her in remembering her fondly today.
So, with that, I'm going to take some questions. And because Josh Earnest has some pull around here, he just happened to put at the top of the list Colleen Nelson of the Wall Street Journal.
My understanding is, Colleen, that this is wrapping up your stint here and you're going to Kansas City.
In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship, and a recognition that those alliances aren’t just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.
With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated and it's hard and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.
The Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles; The belief that we should an economy that works for everybody, not just a few. The belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive. That we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race, or gender, or sexual orientation, or what zip code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn’t just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.
So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn’t be up for debate, should be our North Star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don’t matter if people don’t hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level -- something that's been a running thread in my career.
I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn’t expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.
And the challenge for a national party is how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for. And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press story. It’s increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.
And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up state parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you’re paying attention to, and state rep races and city council races -- that all I think will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.
And I’m optimistic that will happen. For Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I’ve been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And two years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and four years later, I was President of the United States.
Things change pretty rapidly. But they don’t change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy was supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.
Mark Knoller.
If you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis. Today, they’re seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing. There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today it does.
So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any Administration has to deal with today -- and respond to much more rapidly than ever before -- that makes it different. I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about two weeks before anybody reported on it. Imagine that. I think it’s fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they’ve got to figure out in about an hour what their response is.
So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I hope it was. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about. And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff -- particularly your chief of staff, your national security advisor, your White House counsel -- how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that ultimately the President is going to be the final decision-maker, that that’s something that has to be attended to right away.
I have been blessed by having -- and I admittedly am biased -- some of the smartest, hardest-working, good people in my Administration that I think any President has ever had. And as a consequence of that team, I’ve been able to make good decisions. And if you don’t have that around you, then you’ll get swamped. So I hope that he appreciated that advice.
What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election -- all those things are important and should be thought about. And I think it’s important to give him the room and the space to do that. It takes time to put that together.
But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he’s actually taken office.
So the good news is that in some ways my experience is atypical. It’s hard to find an analogous situation. By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years. We were in the midst of a free fall. The financial system was locking up. The auto industry was about to go belly up. The housing market had entirely collapsed. So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job. We just had to make a bunch of decisions.
In this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected -- otherwise, we wouldn’t have had the results that we had in the election. On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been in eight, nine years. Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two. We've got historically low uninsured rates. The financial systems are stable. The housing market has recovered.
We have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us. Our alliances are in strong shape. The progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth. And gas is two bucks a gallon.
So he will have time and space I think to make judicious decisions. The incoming Administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires. They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve. And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last eight years. I’m very proud of them for it.
Athena Jones.
And if I can do a compound question, the other one is you mentioned staffing and tone. What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I’m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor. What message does that send to the country, to the world?
Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn’t vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates.
When I won, there were a number of people who didn’t like me and didn’t like what I stood for. And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts. And so I don’t know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote. But it makes a difference.
So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him, and members of Congress, and reaching out to constituencies that didn’t vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see, and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in.
And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made.
And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that. I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward. And I don’t think any President ever comes in saying to themselves, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country. I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large. And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that.
But it's only been six days. And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve. There are certain things that make for good sound bites but don’t translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with.
I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns, and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that's something that he will want to do. But this is all happening real fast. He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those. And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out. But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that.
And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history -- those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people.
Scott Horsley.
And I think the American people are game for that. They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair. And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans’ attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade. But they’re concerned about whether or not trade is fair, and whether we’ve got the same access to other countries’ markets as they have with us; is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages, and so forth.
Now, I made an argument -- thus far, unsuccessfully -- that the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that, that it strengthened workers’ rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field and, as a consequences, would be good for American workers and American businesses. But that’s a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored.
So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described. And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair -- I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign.
As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy. It keeps this country young. It keeps it dynamic. We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks. And that’s part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful. It’s part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we got a younger population that’s more dynamic.
When it comes to trade, I think when you’re governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you’ve got a global supply chain. The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they’re bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico. And so it’s not as simple as it might have seemed.
That’s going to be our most important strategy. And I think we can successfully do that. People will still be looking to the United States. Our example will still carry great weight. And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past.
Martha Raddatz.
And what’s clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxiety, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive. And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff.
I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately he’s pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well, as long as he’s got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.
Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I’ve got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it’s an ocean liner -- as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes -- even in our first two years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office.
And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he’s really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out. I’ll use an obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act.
So obviously this has been the Holy Grail for Republicans over the last six, seven years -- was “we've got to kill Obamacare.” Now, that has been taken as an article of faith -- that this is terrible, it doesn’t work and we have to undo it.
But now that Republicans are in charge, they got to take a look and say, let's see, we got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn’t have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefitting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of -- everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms.
Now, it's one thing to characterize this thing as not working when it's just an abstraction. Now, suddenly, you're in charge and you're going to repeal it. Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off and suddenly they don’t have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job, and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular. How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they're 26? How are you going to approach all these issues?
Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first one to say, that's great -- congratulations.
If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage, and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way.
So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is now comes the hard part. Now is governance. We are going to be able to present to the incoming Administration a country that is stronger, a federal government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs.
And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse. And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick. And if things get better, then more power to him. And I'll be the first to congratulate him.
This may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper. I am not well organized in that way. And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system because I have bad filing, sorting and organizing habits. And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff. That seems trivial, but actually it ends up being a pretty big piece of business.
I think what will happen with the President-elect is there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them. Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States. Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move. National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes. And I think he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people.
All right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions and then I get out of here.
Nadia Bilbassy.
And on Syria, sir, the Syrian regime now is threatening Aleppo with massive destruction. You spoke passionately a few years back about Benghazi and you warned against the killing of civilians there. Many people criticized your Administration for the shortcoming of the Syria policy. Are you willing to admit any fault under your watch? And how do you act with President-elect Trump says that he won't support the Syrian opposition? Thank you.
At the time, the main argument against it was Iran wouldn’t abide by the deal, that they would cheat. We now have over a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement. That's not just my opinion, it's not just people in my Administration. That's the opinion of Israeli military and intelligence officers who are part of a government that vehemently opposed the deal.
So my suspicion is, is that when the President-elect comes in, and he’s consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts. Because to unravel a deal that's working and preventing Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon would be hard to explain -- particularly if the alternative were to have them freed from any obligations and go ahead and pursue a weapon.
And keep in mind this is not just an international agreement between us and the Iranians; this is between the P5+1, other countries, some of our closest allies. And for us to pull out would then require us to start sanctioning those other countries in Europe or China or Russia that were still abiding by the deal because, from their perspective, Iran had done what it was supposed to do.
So it becomes more difficult I think to undo something that’s working than undo something that isn’t working. And when you’re not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal. When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you’re more likely to look at the facts.
That is going to be true in other circumstances. For example, the Paris agreement. There’s been a lot of talk about the possibility of undoing this international agreement. Now, you’ve got 200 countries that have signed up to this thing. And the good news is that what we’ve been able to show over the last five, six, eight years is that it’s possible to grow the economy really fast and possible to bring down carbon emissions as well.
It’s not just a bunch of rules that we’ve set up. You’ve got utilities that are putting in solar panels and creating jobs. You’ve got the Big Three automakers who have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set. Turns out that people like not having to fill up as often and save money at the pump, even if it’s good for the environment.
You’ve got states like California that have been moving forward on a clean energy agenda separate and apart from any federal regulations that have been put forward. In fact, 40 percent of the country already lives under -- in states that are actively pursuing what’s embodied in the Paris agreement and the Clean Power Plan rule. And even states like Texas that politically tend to oppose me -- you’ve seen huge increases in wind power and solar power. And you’ve got some of the country’s biggest companies, like Google and Walmart, all pursuing energy efficiency because it’s good for their bottom line.
So what we’ve been able to do is to embed a lot of these practices into how our economy works. And it’s made our economy more efficient, it’s helped the bottom line of folks, and it’s cleaned up the environment.
What the Paris agreement now does is say to China and India and other countries that are potentially polluting, come onboard; let’s work together so you guys do the same thing.
And the biggest threat when it comes to climate change and pollution isn’t going to come from us -- because we only have 300 million people. It’s going to come from China, with over a billion people, and India, with over a billion people. And if they are pursuing the same kinds of strategies that we did before we became more aware of the environment, then our kids will be choked off.
And so, again, do I think that the new Administration will make some changes? Absolutely. But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across Administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they’re doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us.
Last question. Justin Sink.
With respect to Syria -- in Benghazi, we had an international mandate. We had a U.N. Security resolution. We had a broad-based coalition, and we were able to carry out a support mission that achieved the initial goal of preventing Benghazi from being slaughtered fairly quickly. It’s no secret -- you know this region well -- that Syria is a much more messy situation, with proxies coming from every direction.
And so I wish that I could bring this to a halt immediately. We have made every effort to try to bring about a political resolution to this challenge. John Kerry has spent an infinite amount of time trying to negotiate with Russians and Iranians and Gulf States and other parties to try to end the killing there. But if what you’re asking is do we have the capacity to carry out the same kinds of military actions in Syria that we did in Libya, the situation is obviously different. We don’t have that option easily available to us.
And so we’re going to have to continue to try to pursue, as best we can, a political solution and, in the interim, put as much pressure as we can on the parties to arrive at humanitarian safe spaces and ceasefires that at least alleviate the suffering that’s on the ground.
I recognize that that has not worked. And it is something that I continue to think about every day, and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end. But I think it’s not surprising to you, because you study this deeply, that if you have a Syrian military that is committed to killing its people indiscriminately, as necessary, and it is supported by Russia that now have substantial military assets on the ground and are actively supporting that regime, and Iran actively supporting that regime, and we are supporting what has to be our number-one national security priority, which is going after ISIL both in Mosul and ultimately in Raqqa -- that the situation is not the same as it was in Libya.
And obviously there are some who question the steps we took in Libya. I continue to believe that was the right thing to do, although, as I indicated before, in the aftermath of that campaign, I think the world community did not sufficiently support the need for some sort of security structures there and now is a situation that we have to get back into a better place.
I’ve given you -- last question is Justin Sink of Bloomberg.
And the second is, the Administration and you have long maintained that the legal constraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander-in-Chief. Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump Administration, is this now the time to sort of test that theory by moving the detainees and see where the chips will lie?
These are kids who were brought here by their parents. They did nothing wrong. They've gone to school. They have pledged allegiance to the flag. Some of them have joined the military. They've enrolled in school. By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character. And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again. And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at.
With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us. What is also true is we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than a hundred people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next two months.
There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States. But because of the nature of the evidence, in some cases, that evidence being compromised, it’s very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court. And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us. My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction. We’d do it a lot cheaper and just as safely.
Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does, as well. We will continue to explore options for doing that. But keep in mind that it’s not just a matter of what I’m willing to do. One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws, and you got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms. And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President.
I am very proud of the fact that we will -- knock on wood -- leave this Administration without significant scandal. We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this Administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms, and keeping trust with the American people -- I will put this Administration against any Administration in history.
And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers. And we had a strong White House Counsel’s Office. We had a strong Ethics Office. We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things. It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it’s supposed to -- because we got 2 million people working in the federal government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could. And that takes a lot of work.
And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously, as well. Again, you wouldn’t know this if you were listening to some news outlets, or some members of oversight committees in Congress. But if you actually look at the facts, it works.
And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the federal government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing. You look at VA. People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix. It was scandalous what happened. What people don’t remember is, is that we’ve brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren’t getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half. Just made the agency work better -- not work perfect, but work better.
And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good. Perfect is unattainable. Better is possible.
And so we will try to share the lessons that we’ve learned over these last eight years with the incoming President. And my hope is he makes things better. And if he does, we’ll all benefit from it.
All right? Thank you, everybody. You guys, some of you who are traveling, you’ll get a chance to ask more questions. All right?
Thank you.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Now you have to tell me something. Who told you I flirted?
I didn't know that I flirted.
I do... I do feel very strongly about the country. I love the country. But I think you're going to have probably George Bush as your next president. He's an excellent guy, an excellent man, he's a friend of mine and I'm here for that reason.
I think I'd have a very good chance. I mean, I like to win. When I do something, I like to win. I like to... I like to do well, and I think I probably would have a pretty good chance.
Well, I employ thousands and thousands of people that wouldn't have jobs if it weren't for things that I built. I mean, I employ probably 25 or 30,000 people, and that... these are things that I've done over the last four -or five-year period. And I think that a lot of people are very thankful for that. So I can't make any excuses. I'm very proud of it.
Well, everybody tells me I'm supposed to be honored by that. I'm not sure of it's an honor or not, but he said... I mean someday maybe he's going to be able to find another topic. But I certainly seem to be in a lot of his cartoons. I'm not sure if they're good, bad, or indifferent but I guess I'm supposed to be honored.
You have a good time.
"
Donald Trump,"Assembly Speaker Chung, distinguished members of this Assembly, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for the extraordinary privilege to speak in this great chamber and to address your people on behalf of the people of the United States of America.
In our short time in your country, Melania and I have been awed by its ancient and modern wonders, and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.
Last night, President and Mrs. Moon showed us incredible hospitality in a beautiful reception at the Blue House. We had productive discussions on increasing military cooperation and improving the trade relationship between our nations on the principle of fairness and reciprocity.
Through this entire visit, it has been both our pleasure and our honor to create and celebrate a long friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea.
This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war, and strengthened by the trials of history. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean soldiers have fought together, sacrificed together, and triumphed together.
Almost 67 years ago, in the spring of 1951, they recaptured what remained of this city where we are gathered so proudly today. It was the second time in a year that our combined forces took on steep casualties to retake this capital from the communists.
Over the next weeks and months, the men soldiered through steep mountains and bloody, bloody battles. Driven back at times, they willed their way north to form the line that today divides the oppressed and the free. And there, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
By the time the armistice was signed in 1953, more than 36,000 Americans had died in the Korean War, with more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. They are heroes, and we honor them. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of your country paid for their freedom. You lost hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
Much of this great city of Seoul was reduced to rubble. Large portions of the country were scarred -- severely, severely hurt -- by this horrible war. The economy of this nation was demolished.
But as the entire world knows, over the next two generations something miraculous happened on the southern half of this peninsula. Family by family, city by city, the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the great nations of the world. And I congratulate you.
Today, your economy is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. Trade has increased 1,900 times. Life expectancy has risen from just 53 years to more than 82 years today.
Like Korea, and since my election exactly one year ago today, I celebrate with you. Our stock market is at an all-time high. Unemployment is at a 17-year low. We are defeating ISIS. We are strengthening our judiciary, including a brilliant Supreme Court justice, and on, and on, and on.
Currently stationed in the vicinity of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. In addition, we have nuclear submarines appropriately positioned.
The United States, under my administration, is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world being built, right now. I want peace through strength.
We are helping the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. And, in the end, we will work things out far better than anybody understands or can even appreciate. I know that the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a faithful ally of the United States very long into the future.
What you have built is truly an inspiration. Your economic transformation was linked to a political one. The proud, sovereign, and independent people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. You secured free parliamentary elections in 1988, the same year you hosted your first Olympics.
Soon after, you elected your first civilian president in more than three decades. And when the Republic you won faced financial crisis, you lined up by the millions to give your most prized possessions -- your wedding rings, heirlooms, and gold “luck keys” -- to restore the promise of a better future for your children.
Your wealth is measured in more than money -- it is measured in achievements of the mind and achievements of spirit. Over the last several decades, your scientists of engineers -- have engineered so many magnificent things. You've pushed the boundaries of technology, pioneered miraculous medical treatments, and emerged as leaders in unlocking the mysteries of our universe.
Korean authors penned roughly 40,000 books this year. Korean musicians fill concert halls all around the world. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates of any country. And Korean golfers are some of the best on Earth.
In fact -- and you know what I'm going to say -- the Women's U.S. Open was held this year at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and it just happened to be won by a great Korean golfer, Sung-hyun Park. An eighth of the top 10 players were from Korea. And the top four golfers -- one, two, three, four -- the top four were from Korea. Congratulations. And that's something. That is really something.
Here in Seoul, architectural wonders like the Sixty-Three Building and the Lotte World Tower -- very beautiful -- grace the sky and house the workers of many growing industries.
Your citizens now help to feed the hungry, fight terrorism, and solve problems all over the world. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. Good luck.
The Korean miracle extends exactly as far as the armies of free nations advanced in 1953 -- 24 miles to the north. There, it stops; it all comes to an end. Dead stop. The flourishing ends, and the prison state of North Korea sadly begins.
Workers in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. Recently, the entire working population was ordered to work for 70 days straight, or else pay for a day of rest.
Families live in homes without plumbing, and fewer than half have electricity. Parents bribe teachers in hopes of saving their sons and daughters from forced labor. More than a million North Koreans died of famine in the 1990s, and more continue to die of hunger today.
Among children under the age of five, nearly 30 percent of afflicted -- and are afflicted by stunted growth due to malnutrition. And yet, in 2012 and 2013, the regime spent an estimated $200 million -- or almost half the money that it allocated to improve living standards for its people -- to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
What remains of the meager harvest of the North Korean economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime. Far from valuing its people as equal citizens, this cruel dictatorship measures them, scores them, and ranks them based on the most arbitrary indications of their allegiance to the state. Those who score the highest in loyalty may live in the capital city. Those who score the lowest starve. A small infraction by one citizen, such as accidently staining a picture of the tyrant printed in a discarded newspaper, can wreck the social credit rank of his entire family for many decades.
An estimated 100,000 North Koreans suffer in gulags, toiling in forced labor, and enduring torture, starvation, rape, and murder on a constant basis.
In one known instance, a 9-year-old boy was imprisoned for 10 years because his grandfather was accused of treason. In another, a student was beaten in school for forgetting a single detail about the life of Kim Jong-un.
Soldiers have kidnapped foreigners and forced them to work as language tutors for North Korean spies.
In the part of Korea that was a stronghold for Christianity before the war, Christians and other people of faith who are found praying or holding a religious book of any kind are now detained, tortured, and in many cases, even executed.
North Korean women are forced to abort babies that are considered ethnically inferior. And if these babies are born, the newborns are murdered.
One woman’s baby born to a Chinese father was taken away in a bucket. The guards said it did not “deserve to live because it was impure.”
So why would China feel an obligation to help North Korea?
The horror of life in North Korea is so complete that citizens pay bribes to government officials to have themselves exported aboard as slaves. They would rather be slaves than live in North Korea.
To attempt to flee is a crime punishable by death. One person who escaped remarked, ""When I think about it now
And so, on this peninsula, we have watched the results of a tragic experiment in a laboratory of history. It is a tale of one people, but two Koreas. One Korea in which the people took control of their lives and their country, and chose a future of freedom and justice, of civilization, and incredible achievement. And another Korea in which leaders imprison their people under the banner of tyranny, fascism, and oppression. The result of this experiment are in, and they are totally conclusive.
When the Korean War began in 1950, the two Koreas were approximately equal in GDP per capita. But by the 1990s, South Korea’s wealth had surpassed North Korea's by more than 10 times. And today, the South’s economy is over 40 times larger. You started the same a short while ago, and now you're 40 times larger. You're doing something right.
Considering the misery wrought by the North Korean dictatorship, it is no surprise that it has been forced to take increasingly desperate measures to prevent its people from understanding this brutal contrast.
Because the regime fears the truth above all else, it forbids virtually all contact with the outside world. Not just my speech today, but even the most commonplace facts of South Korean life are forbidden knowledge to the North Korean people.
Western and South Korean music is banned. Possession of foreign media is a crime punishable by death. Citizens spy on fellow citizens, their homes are subject to search at any time, and their every action is subject to surveillance. In place of a vibrant society, the people of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day.
North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. At the center of this military cult is a deranged belief in the leader’s destiny to rule as parent protector over a conquered Korean Peninsula and an enslaved Korean people.
The more successful South Korea becomes, the more decisively you discredit the dark fantasy at the heart of the Kim regime.
In this way, the very existence of a thriving South Korean republic threatens the very survival of the North Korean dictatorship.
This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and independent Korea not only can, but does stand strong, sovereign, and proud among the nations of the world.
Here, the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a tyrant. It comes from the true and powerful glory of a strong and great people -- the people of the Republic of Korea -- a Korean people who are free to live, to flourish, to worship, to love, to build, and to grow their own destiny.
In this Republic, the people have done what no dictator ever could -- you took, with the help of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. You had a dream -- a Korean dream -- and you built that dream into a great reality.
In so doing, you performed the miracle on the Hahn that we see all around us, from the stunning skyline of Seoul to the plains and peaks of this beautiful landscape. You have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it in your own very beautiful way.
This reality -- this wonderful place -- your success is the greatest cause of anxiety, alarm, and even panic to the North Korean regime. That is why the Kim regime seeks conflict abroad -- to distract from total failure that they suffer at home.
Since the so-called armistice, there have been hundreds of North Korean attacks on Americans and South Koreans.S. surveillance plane that killed 31 American servicemen. The regime has made numerous lethal incursions in South Korea, attempted to assassinate senior leaders, attacked South Korean ships, and tortured Otto Warmbier, ultimately leading to that fine young man's death.
All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with the deluded hope that it could blackmail its way to the ultimate objective. And that objective we are not going to let it have. We are not going to let it have. All of Korea is under that spell, divided in half. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to continue to happen.
The North Korean regime has pursued its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance, agreement, and commitment it has made to the United States and its allies. It's broken all of those commitments.
In 2005, after years of diplomacy, the dictatorship agreed to ultimately abandon its nuclear programs and return to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation. But it never did. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to give up.
In 2009, the United States gave negotiations yet another chance, and offered North Korea the open hand of engagement. The regime responded by sinking a South Korean Navy ship, killing 46 Korean sailors. To this day, it continues to launch missiles over the sovereign territory of Japan and all other neighbors, test nuclear devices, and develop ICBMs to threaten the United States itself.
The regime has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation. This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past.
Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not underestimate us, and do not try us. We will defend our common security, our shared prosperity, and our sacred liberty.
. But here it was drawn, and here it remains to this day.
It is the line between peace and war, between decency and depravity, between law and tyranny, between hope and total despair. It is a line that has been drawn many times, in many places, throughout history. To hold that line is a choice free nations have always had to make. We have learned together the high cost of weakness and the high stakes of its defense.
America’s men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, Communism and terrorism.
America does not seek conflict or confrontation, but we will never run from it. History is filled with discarded regimes that have foolishly tested America’s resolve.
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. We will not permit America or our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated. And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground, we fought and died so hard to secure.
That is why I have come here, to the heart of a free and flourishing Korea, with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world: The time for excuses is over. Now is the time for strength. If you want peace, you must stand strong at all times.
All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea -- to deny it and any form -- any form of it. You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. We call on every nation, including China and Russia, to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions, downgrade diplomatic relations with the regime, and sever all ties of trade and technology.
It is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together -- because the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become.
I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean dictatorship: The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger. Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.
North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. It is a hell that no person deserves. Yet, despite every crime you have committed against God and man, you are ready to offer, and we will do that -- we will offer a path to a much better future. It begins with an end to the aggression of your regime, a stop to your development of ballistic missiles, and complete, verifiable, and total denuclearization.
A sky-top view of this peninsula shows a nation of dazzling light in the South and a mass of impenetrable darkness in the North. We seek a future of light, prosperity, and peace. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea if its leaders cease their threats and dismantle their nuclear program.
The sinister regime of North Korea is right about only one thing: The Korean people do have a glorious destiny, but they could not be more wrong about what that destiny looks like. The destiny of the Korean people is not to suffer in the bondage of oppression, but to thrive in the glory of freedom.
What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a victory for your nation. It is a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. And it is our hope that, someday soon, all of your brothers and sisters of the North will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
Your republic shows us all of what is possible. In just a few decades, with only the hard work, courage, and talents of your people, you turned this war-torn land into a nation blessed with wealth, rich in culture, and deep in spirit. You built a home where all families can flourish and where all children can shine and be happy.
This Korea stands strong and tall among the great community of independent, confident, and peace-loving nations. We are nations that respect our citizens, cherish our liberty, treasure our sovereignty, and control our own destiny. We affirm the dignity of every person and embrace the full potential of every soul. And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.
Together, we dream of a Korea that is free, a peninsula that is safe, and families that are reunited once again. We dream of highways connecting North and South, of cousins embracing cousins, and this nuclear nightmare replaced with the beautiful promise of peace.
Until that day comes, we stand strong and alert. Our eyes are fixed to the North, and our hearts praying for the day when all Koreans can live in freedom.
Thank you. God Bless the Korean people. Thank you very much. Thank you.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
History has shown that the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes. For this reason, upon taking office, I've ordered a complete strategic review of our policy toward the rogue regime in Iran. That review is now complete.
Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regimeÕs hostile actions and to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and all around the world.
Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worldÕs oldest and most vibrant nations, and spread death, destruction, and chaos all around the globe.
Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. The Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah twice bombed our embassy in Lebanon -- once in 1983 and again in 1984. Another Iranian-supported bombing killed 241 Americans -- service members they were, in their barracks in Beirut in 1983.
In 1996, the regime directed another bombing of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
Iranian proxies provided training to operatives who were later involved in al QaedaÕs bombing of the American embassies in Kenya, Tanzania, and two years later, killing 224 people, and wounding more than 4,000 others.
The regime harbored high-level terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, including Osama bin LadenÕs son. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military personnel.
The Iranian dictatorshipÕs aggression continues to this day. The regime remains the worldÕs leading state sponsor of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist networks. It develops, deploys, and proliferates missiles that threaten American troops and our allies.
It harasses American ships and threatens freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf and in the Red Sea. It imprisons Americans on false charges. And it launches cyberattacks against our critical infrastructure, financial system, and military.
The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorshipÕs long campaign of bloodshed. The regime violently suppresses its own citizens; it shot unarmed student protestors in the street during the Green Revolution.
This regime has fueled sectarian violence in Iraq, and vicious civil wars in Yemen and Syria. In Syria, the Iranian regime has supported the atrocities of Bashar al-AssadÕs regime and condoned AssadÕs use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children.
Given the regimeÕs murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future. The regimeÕs two favorite chants are ÒDeath to AmericaÓ and ÒDeath to Israel.Ó
Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States and the United Nations Security Council sought, over many years, to stop IranÕs pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
But the previous administration lifted these sanctions, just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. This deal is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.
As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for years of terrible trade deals that have sacrificed so many millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries. We need negotiators who will much more strongly represent AmericaÕs interest.
The nuclear deal threw IranÕs dictatorship a political and economic lifeline, providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created. It also gave the regime an immediate financial boost and over $100 billion dollars its government could use to fund terrorism.
The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, a large portion of which was physically loaded onto an airplane and flown into Iran. Just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the Iranians waiting at the airport for the cash. I wonder where all that money went.
Worst of all, the deal allows Iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear program. And importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear, Iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in IranÕs path to nuclear weapons.
What is the purpose of a deal that, at best, only delays IranÕs nuclear capability for a short period of time? This, as President of the United States, is unacceptable. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years at a time.
The saddest part of the deal for the United States is that all of the money was paid up front, which is unheard of, rather than at the end of the deal when they have shown theyÕve played by the rules. But whatÕs done is done, and that's why we are where we are.
The Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water. Until recently, the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges.
The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites, even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of IranÕs clandestine nuclear weapons program.
There are also many people who believe that Iran is dealing with North Korea. I am going to instruct our intelligence agencies to do a thorough analysis and report back their findings beyond what they have already reviewed.
By its own terms, the Iran Deal was supposed to contribute to Òregional and international peace and security.Ó And yet, while the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and beyond. Importantly, Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.
So today, in recognition of the increasing menace posed by Iran, and after extensive consultations with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of IranÕs destructive actions.
First, we will work with our allies to counter the regimeÕs destabilizing activity and support for terrorist proxies in the region.
Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.
Third, we will address the regimeÕs proliferation of missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
And finally, we will deny the regime all paths to a nuclear weapon.
Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
The execution of our strategy begins with the long-overdue step of imposing tough sanctions on IranÕs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Revolutionary Guard is the Iranian Supreme LeaderÕs corrupt personal terror force and militia.
It has hijacked large portions of IranÕs economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in Washington, D.C.
I am authorizing the Treasury Department to further sanction the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its support for terrorism and to apply sanctions to its officials, agents, and affiliates.
I urge our allies to join us in taking strong actions to curb Iran's continued dangerous and destabilizing behavior, including thorough sanctions outside the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
Finally, on the grave matter of IranÕs nuclear program: Since the signing of the nuclear agreement, the regime's dangerous aggression has only escalated. At the same time, it has received massive sanctions relief while continuing to develop its missiles program. Iran has also entered into lucrative business contracts with other parties to the agreement.
When the agreement was finalized in 2015, Congress passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to ensure that CongressÕs voice would be heard on the deal.
Among other conditions, this law requires the President, or his designee, to certify that the suspension of sanctions under the deal is Òappropriate and proportionateÓ to measure -- and other measures taken by Iran to terminate its illicit nuclear program. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.
We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of IranÕs nuclear breakout.
That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the dealÕs many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. These include the dealÕs sunset clauses that, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on IranÕs nuclear program.
The flaws in the deal also include insufficient enforcement and near total silence on IranÕs missile programs. Congress has already begun the work to address these problems.
Key House and Senate leaders are drafting legislation that would amend the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to strengthen enforcement, prevent Iran from developing an inter- -- this is so totally important -- an intercontinental ballistic missile, and make all restrictions on IranÕs nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. So important. I support these initiatives.
However, in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. It is under continuous review, and our participation can be cancelled by me, as President, at any time.
As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the worse that threat becomes. It is why we are determined that the worldÕs leading sponsor of terrorism will never obtain nuclear weapons.
In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regimeÕs longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders.
The Iranian people long to -- and they just are longing, to reclaim their countryÕs proud history, its culture, its civilization, its cooperation with its neighbors.
We hope that these new measures directed at the Iranian dictatorship will compel the government to reevaluate its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.
We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East Ð- a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own citizens.
We pray for a future where young children -- American and Iranian, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish -- can grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.
And, until that blessed day comes, we will do what we must to keep America safe.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you.
"
Nick Gibb,"I can confirm that the Department for Education has today published on www.gov.​
The EYFS statutory framework sets the standards that all schools and early years providers must meet to ensure that children from birth to age five learn and develop well and are kept healthy and safe.
Last October, the Government published a consultation on reforms of the EYFS, following a year-long pilot of the proposed reforms. The objectives of our reforms are twofold. First, we want to raise education standards in the early years through improving early years outcomes for all children, particularly disadvantaged children. Secondly, we want to reduce teacher workload so that teachers can spend more time interacting with and supporting children through rich curriculum activities.
The consultation received 2,452 responses prior to the deadline on 31 January 2020. The areas consulted on and the Government’s response to this are as follows:
The framework also sets out high level educational programmes for each area of learning, summarising curriculum activities for all children from birth to five years old. The consultation indicated broad agreement that the proposed educational programmes support children’s overall learning and development with some suggested changes which were considered as part of the final proposals. The consultation also indicated broad agreement with the Early Learning Goals with some suggested areas for clarification which have been reflected in the final proposals.
Although there was mixed support for this, with the common view from respondents being in favour of retaining moderation, we know from the EYFSP pilot evaluation findings that in the absence of external moderation and associated evidence gathering and paperwork, teachers found that their workload had been reduced, allowing them to focus on teaching. Government will therefore proceed with the proposal to remove statutory local authority moderation.
Removing the “exceeding” criteria from the EYFSP: the consultation indicated broad support for this proposal and our response confirms our intention to proceed with this proposal.
Changes to the safeguarding and welfare requirements as set out in the EYFS framework: we consulted on one minor change, namely to explicitly include “oral health” in the current requirement to “promote the good health of children” in the EYFS framework. The consultation indicated strong support for this proposal and the response confirms the Government’s intention to proceed.
We recognise the impact the covid-19 outbreak has had on the early years sector and schools, particularly in terms of the impact on children’s learning and development as a result of closures.
The EYFS reforms outlined in this response provide a strong basis to support children who may have missed critical months of early education.
A copy of the Government’s response will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

Justin Trudeau,"Good morning, everyone.
I am pleased to be here with the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, Catherine McKenna, and the Chair of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Michael Sabia. 
Before making today’s announcement, I would like to take a moment for a COVID-19 update.
In the last few days, COVID-19 cases have continued to rise across the country.  
Ontario has seen its highest ever daily number of cases.
Montréal and Quebec City are at their top level of alert.
And everywhere, this virus remains a threat.
Last spring, we worked together to flatten the curve. I know we can do that again this fall.
So please, keep following public health instructions: Wear a mask, wash your hands, and keep your distance.
And, if you haven’t already, download the COVID Alert app from the App Store or Google Play.
It’s free, it protects your privacy, and it’s another way to keep yourself and others safe.
As of this morning, Manitoba has now brought the app fully online, joining Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan.
And in the coming days, we’re looking forward to even more provinces following their lead. So, download the app today.
For our part, the government is continuing to work with the provinces and territories to keep you safe.
Earlier this week, I called Premier Ford and Premier Legault to offer my full support, as we face this second wave together.
We talked about what more our government could do, especially in terms of screening, and support for small and medium-sized businesses.
Later today, we will hold our nineteenth meeting with Canada’s premiers.
I am thinking of the Safe Restart Agreement and the Safe Return to Class Fund.
These are federal investments that help with all kinds of measures, including personal protective equipment, and the protection of children and school staff.
The priority, right now, is to help Canadians weather the storm.
Last Wednesday, in the Speech from the Throne, we announced our plan to support Canadians through this crisis, as long as it takes, whatever it takes.
Job one remains keeping people safe.
And as we do that, we’re also going to fight for the livelihoods of every single worker.
This spring was tough for a lot of people who either lost their jobs, or saw their hours cut.
And while many Canadians are back at work, many others are still looking.
As a government, there are ways we can help by building on what we’ve done so far.
In the Throne Speech, we announced a plan to create over a million jobs for Canadians.
We’ll make this happen by extending the wage subsidy and investing in youth employment.
And we’ll also look at opportunities in growing sectors, which is what I want to talk about today.
This morning, our government is launching a $10-billion infrastructure plan to build stronger, healthier communities while helping Canadians get back to work.
In fact, this plan alone will create about 60,000 jobs right across the country.
Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, this three-year Growth Plan will invest in everything from clean power, zero-emission buses and home retrofits, to broadband and irrigation infrastructure for farmers.
This is a win-win.
With smart, targeted investments, we can get people back on the job and grow the economy, while building a healthy, sustainable future for everyone.
As we work to build a stronger country, we must ensure that no one is left behind.
The past six months have been difficult for everyone, but especially for many of our seniors.
Seniors: you worked hard your entire lives and now it’s our turn to work hard to give you the best support possible.
Our government will continue to listen, and we will stay on the lookout, to ensure you have everything you need.
As we announced in the Speech from the Throne, we will continue to take steps to protect people in long-term care facilities, while helping seniors to stay in their homes longer and increasing benefits.
Our communities—just like our families—are stronger because of the contributions of seniors.
On National Seniors Day, and every day, let’s recognize the people in our lives who helped raise us, and who made this country what it is.
Finally, I want to end today by recognizing some important news out of the House of Commons.
Earlier this morning, our government introduced a Bill to end conversion therapy in Canada.
It’s past time to put a stop to this unacceptable, discredited practice that has hurt far too many LGBTQ2 Canadians.
Conversion therapy is harmful, degrading, and has no place in Canada.
I hope all parties step up, come together, and support this Bill.
Thank you.
"
Ulysses S. Grant,"To the Senate of the United States:
Senate bill No. 1044, ""to provide for the resumption of specie payments,"" is before me, and this day receives my signature of approval.
I venture upon this unusual method of conveying the notice of approval to the ""House in which the measure originated"" because of its great importance to the country at large and in order to suggest further legislation which seems to me essential to make this law effective.
It is a subject of congratulation that a measure has become law which fixes a date when specie resumption shall commence and implies an obligation on the part of Congress, if in its power, to give such legislation as may prove necessary to redeem this promise.
To this end I respectfully call your attention to a few suggestions:
First. The necessity of an increased revenue to carry out the obligation of adding to the sinking fund annually 1 per cent of the public debt, amounting now to about $34,000,000 per annum, and to carry out the promises of this measure to redeem, under certain contingencies, eighty millions of the present legal-tenders, and, without contingency, the fractional currency now in circulation.
How to increase the surplus revenue is for Congress to devise, but I will venture to suggest that the duty on tea and coffee might be restored without permanently enhancing the cost to the consumers, and that the 10 per cent horizontal reduction of the tariff on articles specified in the law of June 6, 1872, be repealed. The supply of tea and coffee already on hand in the United States would in all probability be advanced in price by adopting this measure. But it is known that the adoption of free entry to those articles of necessity did not cheapen them, but merely added to the profits of the countries producing them, or of the middlemen in those countries, who have the exclusive trade in them.
Second. The first section of the bill now under consideration provides that the fractional currency shall be redeemed in silver coin as rapidly as practicable. There is no provision preventing the fluctuation in the value of the paper currency. With gold at a premium of anything over 10 per cent above the currency in use, it is probable, almost certain, that silver would be bought up for exportation as fast as it was put out, or until change would become so scarce as to make the premium on it equal to the premium on gold, or sufficiently high to make it no longer profitable to buy for export, thereby causing a direct loss to the community at large and great embarrassment to trade.
As the present law commands final resumption on the 1st day of January, 1879, and as the gold receipts by the Treasury are larger than the gold payments and the currency receipts are smaller than the currency payments, thereby making monthly sales of gold necessary to meet current currency expenses, it occurs to me that these difficulties might be remedied by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem legal-tender notes, whenever presented in sums of not less than $100 and multiples thereof, at a premium for gold of 10 per cent, less interest at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent per annum from the 1st day of January, 1875, to the date of putting this law into operation, and diminishing this premium at the same rate until final resumption, changing the rate of premium demanded from time to time as the interest amounts to one-quarter of 1 per cent. I suggest this rate of interest because it would bring currency at par with gold at the date fixed by law for final resumption. I suggest 10 per cent as the demand premium at the beginning because I believe this rate would insure the retention of silver in the country for change.
The provisions of the third section of the act will prevent combinations being made to exhaust the Treasury of coin.
With such a law it is presumable that no gold would be called for not required for legitimate business purposes. When large amounts of coin should be drawn from the Treasury, correspondingly large amounts of currency would be withdrawn from circulation, thus causing a sufficient stringency in currency to stop the outward flow of coin.
The advantages of a currency of a fixed known value would also be reached. In my opinion, by the enactment of such a law business and industries would revive and the beginning of prosperity on a firm basis would be reached.
Other means of increasing revenue than those suggested should probably be devised, and also other legislation.
In fact, to carry out the first section of the act another mint becomes a necessity. With the present facilities for coinage, it would take a period probably beyond that fixed by law for final specie resumption to coin the silver necessary to transact the business of the country.
There are now smelting furnaces, for extracting the silver and gold from the ores brought from the mountain territories, in Chicago, St. Louis, and Omaha--three in the former city--and as much of the change required will be wanted in the Mississippi Valley States, and as the metals to be coined come from west of those States, and, as I understand, the charges for transportation of bullion from either of the cities named to the mint in Philadelphia or to New York City amount to $4 for each $1,000 worth, with an equal expense for transportation back, it would seem a fair argument in favor of adopting one or more of those cities as the place or places for the establishment of new coining facilities.
I have ventured upon this subject with great diffidence, because it is so unusual to approve a measure--as I most heartily do this, even if no further legislation is attainable at this time--and to announce the fact by message. But I do so because I feel that it is a subject of such vital importance to the whole country that it should receive the attention of and be discussed by Congress and the people through the press, and in every way, to the end that the best and most satisfactory course may be reached of executing what I deem most beneficial legislation on a most vital question to the interests and prosperity of the nation.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. You just want massive tax cuts. That's what you want. That's the only reason you're going so wild. What a place.
. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it.
I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well. We appreciate it.
Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane. I mean, their island was virtually destroyed. Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible.
Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly.
I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms. We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done. It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico.
And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis. It's something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that.
And I'm very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected. And many of their policemen -- in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it's been a tough go. But we are -- we're going to get it back.
Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county's history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare. We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy. But with the rules of reconciliation, we're up against a deadline of Friday -- two days.
That's just two days. And yes-vote senator -- we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator -- who is a yes vote, but he's home recovering from a pretty tough situation. And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent.
It's going to be better managed for the people that it serves. Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C. Not even a contest.
And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly. But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote. So we're getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare.
And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I'd come in and sign. But it didn't work that way. There were a couple of people that -- I won't say anything. And we're going to be able to get that through, and I think we'll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier.
But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve. By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won't for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one. And most of you know exactly what I'm talking about.
We're here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People.
This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it's probably something I can say that I'm very good at. I've been waiting for this for a long time. We're going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country -- and most people thought left our country for good.
We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American.
Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens. This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation -- and are we cutting regulation.
And businesses all across the country have taken notice. In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states. Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed -- meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.
All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again. They chose, and their choice was so important.
It's time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana. We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them. That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office. That is what I talked about on the campaign trail.
Already, we're seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first. Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium. It's really a fantastic thing to see.
Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs. GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time. But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better.
Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country.
America is back on the right track. And I see so many red hats -- Make America Great Again. That's what we're doing -- Make America Great Again. It's a relic. We've got to change it. We have to compete -- compete with other countries.
The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America's economic comeback because it can be far greater than it's ever been. But we're going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally -- and want and deserve.
For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform. Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families -- for the working man and woman -- and for businesses of all sizes.
I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people. These tax cuts are significant. There's never been tax cuts like what we're talking about.
Our framework is based on four key ideas: First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans -- the people that work so long, so hard, and they've been forgotten. But they're not forgotten anymore. I think we proved that on November 8th.
. So, a married couple -- up to $24,000 -- can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do. So much better.
In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero.
Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today. Where are they? Oh, hello, Jonathan. How are you.
Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company. Together they're raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000. Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more. And that's just on federal taxes. So they would have saved at least $1,000.
Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for. Greatly expanded.
We're also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children.
In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved -- and we love these people, but we're caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents -- will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit.
We're doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family. By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners.
Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected. They can call me all they want. It's not going to help. I'm doing the right thing, and it's not good for me. Believe me.
But what is good for me -- not only as President and legacy -- what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years. That's good for me. That's good for everyone.
In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. We've also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people.
Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally.
Americans waste money. Americans waste so much money -- billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code. More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes. Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper.
We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. About time.
The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts. You're all familiar with it. Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with. We are making our taxes simple again. We are simplifying our tax system.
To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax.
That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you'll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won't have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax -- lose the business, ends up going out of business. All of those jobs are lost. The farmers in particular are affected.
They have wonderful farms, but they can't pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm. The people that buy it don't run it with love. They can't run it the same way, and it goes out. So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers. And we're getting rid of it.
Now if you don't like your family, it won't matter, okay.
With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg -- Where's Kip? Go ahead, Kip. How long, Kip? A hundred and eighty-seven years -- that's peanuts, Kip.
Wow. That's a long time. But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family. We're not going to let that happen.
We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today.
We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans. Okay.
Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.
In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers. Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations. And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways. They say they're friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals.
And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines -- Dakota Access. You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved. So we're letting that happen.
But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more. And it was a beautiful sight to behold.
Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did. And I shouldn't say even better because we didn't run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out. And we're stopping that, and you see it right here what we've done.
Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world. That's not good. We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we're not surrendering anymore. We're not surrendering anymore.
Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again. That.
This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven't seen in many years.
When our companies move to other countries, it's our loyal American workers who get hurt. And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it's our wonderful workers who reap the rewards.
And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they're going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States -- between increasing and new -- five.
And I said thank you very much, and he said, ""you know what? It's starting to happen in the United States. It's starting to happen."""" So I just wanted to let you know that. I promised I wouldn't say who. I'll keep my word. Okay. [Laughter
Members of both parties -- it happens to be in the automobile industry. That's a good industry.
And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent -- much lower. Big difference.
To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off -- listen to this -- the cost of equipment in the year they buy it. That is big.
And that's instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time. Now that's called incentive. That's called incentive.
Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis. John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary. Congratulations, John.
And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I'm just thinking -- I have to mention this -- you know, we have a fence around the White House. And I figured, you know -- I'm pretty good at construction -- I figured, I don't know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half. And this has been taking place over a long period of time -- previous administrations.
So I said, ""how much is the fence you're talking around the White House?"""" """"Sir
We're going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million. Now, I assume it's a strong fence. So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million? I think he could take $49 off right now and he'd have plenty of profit. Right? Right, John? It's crazy. Never understand it, but we're working on it.
John says that a tax cut like we're proposing will make his business more competitive, allowing him to expand, hire more workers, and raise wages for his current employees. Right, John?
Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology. Where's Aaron? Hello, Aaron. Hi.
Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high -- and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas. You've been watching it, Aaron. Right? All over. Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States.
We're going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America. You're going to be in a much different position. Okay. Tremendous incentives.
We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. Right.
Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas. And by the way, for years I've been hearing it's 2.5 trillion. So I've been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it's much more. Right? But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it.
For years -- who doesn't want to do it? They want to bring -- but they can't do it because it's so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous. So they can't do it. So the money stays in other countries, and it's invested in other countries. We want to bring it back.
But think of it, it's one of the few things -- Democrats want it and Republicans want it. So they both want it, and yet for years they haven't been able to do it. Now we're doing it. We're doing things.
You know, it's one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there's a dispute. But here's something everybody wants and they can't do it. So you can tell you, there's a broken system in D.C., but we're getting it fixed rather -- I think -- rather rapidly. You'll be seeing that over the next few months.
Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country. We're punishing them for bringing the money back in.
As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether. And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas -- so much, it's an incredible amount -- that they move the company to get their money. We're going to let them bring the money back home.
Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States. We're punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States. We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work.
The framework I've just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America's competitive edge. Finally.
And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews. And if Senator Donnelly doesn't approve it, because you know he's on the other side, we will come here. We will campaign against him like you wouldn't believe.
I think they're going to approve it. I think we'll have -- actually, I think we'll have numerous Democrats come across because it's the right thing to do.
These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates. It's what we can't do. Our competitors have much lower tax rates. But no longer. My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model. It's called -- the American model.
Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country. That's what we want. We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana. Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they're incentivized to leave. But now they're going to be incentivized to stay. And if that doesn't work, then we'll get even tougher than that. Okay?
We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns. We want it to happen here.
Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today. I really believe we're going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it's the right thing to do.
I believe that it's the right thing to do, and I know many of them. And they're telling me it is the right thing to do. President Reagan's tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker -- Tip O'Neill.
Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment. As President Kennedy very wisely said, ""The single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time"""" -- at the right time
My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time. Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle -- it's called a middle-class miracle, once again. It's also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person.
I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country. Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first. And that's what we're doing.
History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people. That is why today I am asking all Americans -- Republican, Democrat, independent -- to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again.
Call your congressmen. Call your senators. Let them know you're watching. Let them know you're waiting. Tell them that today is the day for decision. That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound. And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us.
If you demand it, the politicians will listen. They will answer, and they will act. And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride.
With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Donald Trump,"Well, thank you all very much. we're at the SAFE station, which has become -- all over the country, people are coming here to see what they're doing here in New Hampshire, and we're talking today about drug addiction and drugs and opioids and all of the problems, and I think what I'm going to do is ask the chief, who has done an incredible job. He was here before the election. I said I was going to come back, and I came back.
So I'm going to ask chief just to say a few words about it, because it's really quite incredible.
Thank you very much
I also want to thank the governor and the mayor for being here and, perhaps, Governor Sununu, you'd say a few words.
As you know we are getting a big response in Congress for helping with opioid and drug use that's literally taking place as we speak. So a lot of money's coming in and unfortunately, it's more than just the money, it's competence and some of the things they do.
So I just want to thank you there and... and governor and chief and everybody that's here, maybe especially these incredible people that are working here and seeing, every day you see.. every you see some pretty tough things, right folks? Anybody wanted to say a little bit about what you do here? Go ahead.
And you save a lot of lives. I've been reading a lot about it. You save a lot of lives. So a lot of people coming from all over the country to check out exactly what you're doing Chief.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.

Jeremy Corbyn,"Labour Party members have a right to accountability and transparency of decisions taken in their name, and an effective commitment from the party to combat antisemitism and racism in all their forms.
The Party’s decision to apologise today and make substantial payments to former staff who sued the party in relation to last year’s Panorama programme is a political decision, not a legal one.
Our legal advice was that the party had a strong defence, and the evidence in the leaked Labour report that is now the subject of an NEC inquiry led by Martin Forde QC strengthened concerns about the role played by some of those who took part in the programme.
The decision to settle these claims in this way is disappointing, and risks giving credibility to misleading and inaccurate allegations about action taken to tackle antisemitism in the Labour Party in recent years.
To give our members the answers and justice they deserve, the inquiry led by Martin Forde must now fully address the evidence the internal report uncovered of racism, sexism, factionalism and obstruction of Labour’s 2017 General Election campaign.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.
And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.
When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It's hard to believe. Inconceivable.
You say who's making these deals? We're going the make great deals. We're going to have a strong border. We're going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.
But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It's called make America great again.
No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.
You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.
And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what's going on.
Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.
And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.
And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe. We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now. People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.
We're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again. And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.
Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.
And that's what I want to talk about.
Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.
It's just words, folks. It's just words. Those words, I've been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.
I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I'm going to help the African-Americans. I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.
She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...
So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?
Sounds fair.
It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I'm not proud of it. But that was something that happened.
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.
So don't tell me about words. I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.
Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.
Number two, Michelle Obama. I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.
So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.
But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.
And I'll tell you what. I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.
When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.
So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Oh, really?
Because you'd be in jail.
And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document. Right? She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.
You know, it's amazing. I'm watching Hillary go over facts. And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don't think so.
She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.
And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn't before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.
Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
You did that. Wait a minute. One second.
If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
Oh, you didn't delete them?
Oh, 33,000? Yeah.
Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?
Because you have nothing to say.
Get off this question.
Let's see what happens...
I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails? I'd like to know. Why aren't you bringing...
No, it hasn't. It hasn't. And it hasn't been finished at all.
It's nice to -- one on three.
No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.
It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.
It's only getting worse. In '17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.
Obamacare will never work. It's very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.
We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.
You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It's catastrophic in certain ways.
But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.
It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.
Well, I just want -- just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.
By the way...
We're going to be able to. You're going to have plans...
Well, I'll tell you what it means. You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...
President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.
But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.
And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We're going to block grant into the states. We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...
... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.
As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They'll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.
And, you know, there's always a reason for everything. If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.
And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism."" Now
First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me. Excuse me..
Why don't you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.
Why don't you interrupt her?
It's called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.
We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.
That's not been debunked.
That has not been debunked.
I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn't have. Well, I just want to say...
Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
Could I just respond to this, please?
Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them. In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don't want them.
And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country. Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country. They're murderers and some very bad people.
And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen. We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.
ICE just endorsed me. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn't. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It's a horrible thing she's doing. She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.
Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous. Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That's one that I haven't...
OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That's the good thing. That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That's a big, big difference. We're talking about some difference.
But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don't know Putin.
But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.
I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.
Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.
I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great.
Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.
She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn't she change it? Why didn't you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.
But -- and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. I wish you would have done this."" But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.""""ut -- and I say that about a lot of things. You know
We're getting rid of carried interest provisions. I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form. We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.
But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.
And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She's raising your taxes really high. And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There's no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down at 1 percent. And that's, like, no growth. And we're going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.
Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.
A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That's why.
See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president. Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving. Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.
But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous. So we won't make them famous.
No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she's given it to us.
Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn't she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn't she do something about it? She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it's all talk and no action.
And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.
Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it?
Oh, really?
You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.
She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...
Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.
First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...
OK. But you were in contact -- excuse me. You were...
You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.
Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.
Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We're tired. We're exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.
Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn't even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi's out. It's a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I'm sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone's all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.
But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There's only one problem. You don't even know who the rebels are. So what's the purpose?
And one thing I have to say.
I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.
OK. He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.
I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.
I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn't.
I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.
I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.
Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can't they do it quietly? Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying? How stupid is our country?
I can't think of any. I can't think of any. And I'm pretty good at it.
And we have General Flynn. And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How -- why would these people stay there? I've been reading now...
... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore. They're gone. Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.
Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.
Everything.
You know what's funny? She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her. When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.
It's really -- it's really very interesting.
Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.
Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she's lied about a lot of things.
I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what's happening to our inner cities. She's been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn't get it done.
Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don't get it done. You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.
I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing's going to ever happen.
Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen. It's just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She's not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.
But I will tell you, she's all talk. It doesn't get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.
It turned out to be a disaster.
... but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.
We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.
We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.
She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.
No, there wasn't check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.
By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...
... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that. But she said she'll be awake. Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.
Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It's a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.
I'm shocked to hear that.
We have the slowest growth since 1929.
It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.
Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.
But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.
Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing. What I ask is this.
So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.
I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?
It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren't you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign? I'm just curious.
Absolutely. I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.
We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.
And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.
I will bring our energy companies back. They'll be able to compete. They'll make money. They'll pay off our national debt. They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.
You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.
The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It's a disgrace.
It's an absolute disgrace.
Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children. And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.
I will say this about Hillary. She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.

Thangam Debbonaire,"This raises serious questions about the Government’s strategy on rough sleeping.
This chaotic Government has no plan to avoid a self-made homelessness crisis this winter. They need to extend the ban on evictions, and come forward with a credible plan to keep their promise that no renter will lose their home because of Coronavirus.

John F. Kennedy,"Good evening, my fellow citizens: I returned this morning from a week-long trip to Europe and I want to report to you on that trip in full. It was in every sense an unforgettable experience. The people of Paris, of Vienna, of London, were generous in their greeting. They were heartwarming in their hospitality, and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated. We knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented, which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom. Equally memorable was the pageantry of European history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception, to lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe, to dine at Versailles, and Schonbrunn Palace, and with the Queen of England. These are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come. Each of the three cities that we visited--Paris, Vienna, and London--have existed for many centuries, and each serves as a reminder that the Western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years, and has defended itself over many centuries. But this was not a ceremonial trip. Two aims of American foreign policy, above all others, were the reason for the trip: the unity of the free world, whose strength is the security of us all, and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace. My trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims. To strengthen the unity of the West, our journey opened in Paris and closed in London. My talks with General de Gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me. Certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom. Our alliance, I believe, became more secure; the friendship of our nation, I hope--with theirs--became firmer; and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer, and I hope were marked by confidence. I found General de Gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position, whether or not it was his own, than in appearing to agree with him when we do not. But he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance. He is after all the only major leader of World War II who still occupies a position of great responsibility. His life has been one of unusual dedication; he is a man of extraordinary personal character, symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of France. Throughout our discussions he took the long view of France and the world at large. I found him a wise counselor for the future, and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make. Thus we had a valuable meeting. I believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time--I believe were removed on both sides. Problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away. No question, however sensitive, was avoided. No area of interest was ignored, and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future--in our agreement on defending Berlin, on working to improve the defenses of Europe, on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world, including Latin America, on spurring European economic unity, on concluding successfully the conference on Laos, and on closer consultations and solidarity in the Western alliance. General de Gaulle could not have been more cordial, and I could not have more confidence in any man. In addition to his individual strength of character, the French people as a whole showed vitality and energy which were both impressive and gratifying. Their recovery from the postwar period is dramatic, their productivity is increasing, and they are steadily building their stature in both Europe and Africa, and thus, I left Paris for Vienna with increased confidence in Western unity and strength. The people of Vienna know what it is to live under occupation, and they know what it is to live in freedom. Their welcome to me as President of this country should be heartwarming to us all. I went to Vienna to meet the leader of the Soviet Union, Mr. Khrushchev. For 2 days we met in sober, intensive conversation, and I believe it is my obligation to the people, to the Congress, and to our allies to report on those conversations candidly and publicly. Mr. Khrushchev and I had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries. I will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days. There was no discourtesy, no loss of tempers, no threats or ultimatums by either side; no advantage or concession was either gained or given; no major decision was either planned or taken; no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended. This kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full-fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers, where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought, but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting, nor did we plan any future summit meetings at Vienna. But I found this meeting with Chairman Khrushchev, as somber as it was, to be immensely useful. I had read his speeches and of his policies. I had been advised on his views. I had been told by other leaders of the West, General de Gaulle, Chancellor Adenauer, Prime Minister Macmillan, what manner of man he was. But I bear the responsibility of the Presidency of the United States, and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me. It is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible, that they are based on as much direct, firsthand knowledge as possible. I therefore thought it was of immense importance that I know Mr. Khrushchev, that I gain as much insight and understanding as I could on his present and future policies. At the same time, I wanted to make certain Mr. Khrushchev knew this country and its policies, that he understood our strength and our determination, and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind. I wanted to present our views to him directly, precisely, realistically, and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification. This was done. No new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side. The gap between us was not, in such a short period, materially reduced, but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully, at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less, and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact. This is important, for neither of us tried to merely please the other, to agree merely to be agreeable, to say what the other wanted to hear. And just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross-examination, instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper, so, too, was this direct give-and-take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital, for the facts of the matter are that the Soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words--war, peace, democracy, and popular will. We have wholly different views of right and wrong, of what is an internal affair and what is aggression, and, above all, we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going. Only by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that Mr. Khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future. Our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood. Neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests. But both of us were there, I think, because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other, that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible, since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine, and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued. We believe in a system of national freedom and independence. He believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism, and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends. However difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests, I think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort. That is why I considered the Vienna talks to be useful. The somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation, nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear. It simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as Americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty. The one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was Laos. Both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation. Both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent Laos, much in the manner of Burma or Cambodia. Of critical importance to the current conference on Laos in Geneva, both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease-fire. It is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at Geneva, enabling the International Control Commission to do its duty, to make certain that a cease-fire is enforced and maintained. I am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at Geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere. No such hope emerged, however with respect to the other deadlocked Geneva conference, seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests. Mr. Khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator--in his opinion because no one was truly neutral; that a Soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement; that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage, in the absence of total disarmament; and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile. In short, our hopes for an end to nuclear tests, for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons, and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow. Nevertheless, the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at Geneva. But our most somber talks were on the subject of Germany and Berlin. I made it clear to Mr. Khrushchev that the security of Western Europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to West Berlin, that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance, and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk, and thus meet our obligation to the people of West Berlin, and their right to choose their own future. Mr. Khrushchev, in turn, presented his views in detail, and his presentation will be the subject of further communications. But we are not seeking to change the present situation. A binding German peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with Germany, and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of West Berlin. Generally, Mr. Khrushchev did not talk in terms of war. He believes the world will move his way without resort to force. He spoke of his nation's achievements in space. He stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production, to out-trade us, to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours. Most of all, he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries. He was certain that the tide there was moving his way, that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a Communist revolution, and that the so-called wars of liberation, supported by the Kremlin, would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion. In the 1940's and early fifties, the great danger was from Communist armies marching across free borders, which we saw in Korea. Our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas. Now we face a new and different threat. We no longer have a nuclear monopoly. Their missiles, they believe, will hold off our missiles, and their troops can match our troops should we intervene in these so-called wars of liberation. Thus, the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrillas or insurgents or subversion. A small group of disciplined Communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be $60 or $70 a year, and seize control, therefore, of an entire country without Communist troops ever crossing any international frontier. This is the Communist theory. But I believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong, that liberty and independence and self-determination--not communism-is the future of man, and that free men have the will and the resources to win the struggle for freedom. But it is clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poorer nations will be a continuing crisis of this decade. Mr. Khrushchev made one point which I wish to pass on. He said there are many disorders throughout the world, and he should not be blamed for them all. He is quite right. It is easy to dismiss as Communist-inspired every anti-government or anti-American riot, every overthrow of a corrupt regime, or every mass protest against misery and despair. These are not all Communist-inspired. The Communists move in to exploit them, to infiltrate their leadership, to ride their crest to victory. But the Communists did not create the conditions which caused them. In short, the hopes for freedom in these areas which see so much poverty and illiteracy, so many children who are sick, so many children-who die in the first year, so many families without homes, so many families without hope--the future for freedom in these areas rests with the local peoples and their governments. If they have the will to determine their own future, if their governments have the support of their own people, if their honest and progressive measures--helping their people--have inspired confidence and zeal, then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed. But where those conditions do not exist, a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offers little protection against internal decay. Yet all this does not mean that our Nation and the West and the free world can only sit by. On the contrary, we have an historic opportunity to help these countries build their societies until they are so strong and broadly based that only an outside invasion could topple them, and that threat, we know, can be stopped. We can train and equip their forces to resist Communist-supplied insurrections. We can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standards can be built. We can encourage better administration and better education and better tax and land distribution and a better life for the people. All this and more we can do because we have the talent and the resources to do it, if we will only use and share them. I know that there is a great deal of feeling in the United States that we have carried the burden of economic assistance long enough, but these countries that we are now supporting-stretching all the way along from the top of Europe through the Middle East, down through Saigon--are now subject to great efforts internally, in many of them, to seize control. If we're not prepared to assist them in making a better life for their people, then I believe that the prospects for freedom in those areas are uncertain. We must, I believe, assist them if we are determined to meet with commitments of assistance our words against the Communist advance. The burden is heavy; we have carried it for many years. But I believe that this fight is not over. This battle goes on, and we have to play our part in it. And therefore I hope again that we will assist these people so that they can remain free. It was fitting that Congress opened its hearings on our new foreign military and economic aid programs in Washington at the very time that Mr. Khrushchev's words in Vienna were demonstrating as nothing else could the need for that very program. It should be well run, effectively administered, but I believe we must do it, and I hope that you, the American people, will support it again, because I think it's vitally important to the security of these areas. There is no use talking against the Communist advance unless we're willing to meet our responsibilities, however burdensome they may be. I do not justify this aid merely on the grounds of anti-Communism. It is a recognition of our opportunity and obligation to help these people be free, and we are not alone. I found that the people of France, for example, were doing far more in Africa in the way of aiding independent nations than our own country was. But I know that foreign aid is a burden that is keenly felt and I can only say that we have no more crucial obligation now. My stay in England was short but the visit gave me a chance to confer privately again with Prime Minister Macmillan, just as others of our party in Vienna were conferring yesterday with General de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer. We all agreed that there is work to be done in the West and from our conversations have come agreed steps to get on with that work. Our day in London, capped by a meeting with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip was a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the West remains united in its determination to hold to its standards. May I conclude by saying simply that I am glad to be home. We have on this trip admired splendid places and seen stirring sights, but we are glad to be home. No demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which you, the American people, have so generously given to our country. With that support I am not fearful of the future. We must be patient. We must be determined. We must be courageous. We must accept both risks and burdens, but with the will and the work freedom will prevail. Good night, and thank you very much. Good evening, my fellow citizens: I returned this morning from a week-long trip to Europe and I want to report to you on that trip in full. It was in every sense an unforgettable experience. The people of Paris, of Vienna, of London, were generous in their greeting. They were heartwarming in their hospitality, and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated. We knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented, which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom. Equally memorable was the pageantry of European history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception, to lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe, to dine at Versailles, and Schonbrunn Palace, and with the Queen of England. These are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come. Each of the three cities that we visited--Paris, Vienna, and London--have existed for many centuries, and each serves as a reminder that the Western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years, and has defended itself over many centuries. But this was not a ceremonial trip. Two aims of American foreign policy, above all others, were the reason for the trip: the unity of the free world, whose strength is the security of us all, and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace. My trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims. To strengthen the unity of the West, our journey opened in Paris and closed in London. My talks with General de Gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me. Certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom. Our alliance, I believe, became more secure; the friendship of our nation, I hope--with theirs--became firmer; and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer, and I hope were marked by confidence. I found General de Gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position, whether or not it was his own, than in appearing to agree with him when we do not. But he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance. He is after all the only major leader of World War II who still occupies a position of great responsibility. His life has been one of unusual dedication; he is a man of extraordinary personal character, symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of France. Throughout our discussions he took the long view of France and the world at large. I found him a wise counselor for the future, and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make. Thus we had a valuable meeting. I believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time--I believe were removed on both sides. Problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away. No question, however sensitive, was avoided. No area of interest was ignored, and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future--in our agreement on defending Berlin, on working to improve the defenses of Europe, on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world, including Latin America, on spurring European economic unity, on concluding successfully the conference on Laos, and on closer consultations and solidarity in the Western alliance. General de Gaulle could not have been more cordial, and I could not have more confidence in any man. In addition to his individual strength of character, the French people as a whole showed vitality and energy which were both impressive and gratifying. Their recovery from the postwar period is dramatic, their productivity is increasing, and they are steadily building their stature in both Europe and Africa, and thus, I left Paris for Vienna with increased confidence in Western unity and strength. The people of Vienna know what it is to live under occupation, and they know what it is to live in freedom. Their welcome to me as President of this country should be heartwarming to us all. I went to Vienna to meet the leader of the Soviet Union, Mr. Khrushchev. For 2 days we met in sober, intensive conversation, and I believe it is my obligation to the people, to the Congress, and to our allies to report on those conversations candidly and publicly. Mr. Khrushchev and I had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries. I will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days. There was no discourtesy, no loss of tempers, no threats or ultimatums by either side; no advantage or concession was either gained or given; no major decision was either planned or taken; no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended. This kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full-fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers, where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought, but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting, nor did we plan any future summit meetings at Vienna. But I found this meeting with Chairman Khrushchev, as somber as it was, to be immensely useful. I had read his speeches and of his policies. I had been advised on his views. I had been told by other leaders of the West, General de Gaulle, Chancellor Adenauer, Prime Minister Macmillan, what manner of man he was. But I bear the responsibility of the Presidency of the United States, and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me. It is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible, that they are based on as much direct, firsthand knowledge as possible. I therefore thought it was of immense importance that I know Mr. Khrushchev, that I gain as much insight and understanding as I could on his present and future policies. At the same time, I wanted to make certain Mr. Khrushchev knew this country and its policies, that he understood our strength and our determination, and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind. I wanted to present our views to him directly, precisely, realistically, and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification. This was done. No new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side. The gap between us was not, in such a short period, materially reduced, but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully, at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less, and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact. This is important, for neither of us tried to merely please the other, to agree merely to be agreeable, to say what the other wanted to hear. And just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross-examination, instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper, so, too, was this direct give-and-take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital, for the facts of the matter are that the Soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words--war, peace, democracy, and popular will. We have wholly different views of right and wrong, of what is an internal affair and what is aggression, and, above all, we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going. Only by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that Mr. Khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future. Our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood. Neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests. But both of us were there, I think, because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other, that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible, since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine, and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued. We believe in a system of national freedom and independence. He believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism, and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends. However difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests, I think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort. That is why I considered the Vienna talks to be useful. The somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation, nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear. It simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as Americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty. The one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was Laos. Both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation. Both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent Laos, much in the manner of Burma or Cambodia. Of critical importance to the current conference on Laos in Geneva, both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease-fire. It is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at Geneva, enabling the International Control Commission to do its duty, to make certain that a cease-fire is enforced and maintained. I am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at Geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere. No such hope emerged, however with respect to the other deadlocked Geneva conference, seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests. Mr. Khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator--in his opinion because no one was truly neutral; that a Soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement; that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage, in the absence of total disarmament; and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile. In short, our hopes for an end to nuclear tests, for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons, and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow. Nevertheless, the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at Geneva. But our most somber talks were on the subject of Germany and Berlin. I made it clear to Mr. Khrushchev that the security of Western Europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to West Berlin, that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance, and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk, and thus meet our obligation to the people of West Berlin, and their right to choose their own future. Mr. Khrushchev, in turn, presented his views in detail, and his presentation will be the subject of further communications. But we are not seeking to change the present situation. A binding German peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with Germany, and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of West Berlin. Generally, Mr. Khrushchev did not talk in terms of war. He believes the world will move his way without resort to force. He spoke of his nation's achievements in space. He stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production, to out-trade us, to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours. Most of all, he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries. He was certain that the tide there was moving his way, that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a Communist revolution, and that the so-called wars of liberation, supported by the Kremlin, would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion. In the 1940's and early fifties, the great danger was from Communist armies marching across free borders, which we saw in Korea. Our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas. Now we face a new and different threat. We no longer have a nuclear monopoly. Their missiles, they believe, will hold off our missiles, and their troops can match our troops should we intervene in these so-called wars of liberation. Thus, the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrillas or insurgents or subversion. A small group of disciplined Communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be $60 or $70 a year, and seize control, therefore, of an entire country without Communist troops ever crossing any international frontier. This is the Communist theory. But I believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong, that liberty and independence and self-determination--not communism-is the future of man, and that free men have the will and the resources to win the struggle for freedom. But it is clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poorer nations will be a continuing crisis of this decade. Mr. Khrushchev made one point which I wish to pass on. He said there are many disorders throughout the world, and he should not be blamed for them all. He is quite right.

Theresa Villiers,"The cross-party talks that ran from 8 September to 17 November last year, which culminated in the Fresh Start agreement, brought us closer than ever before to consensus on the best way to deal with Northern Ireland’s past. While we established much common ground, it was not possible to reach agreement on all issues. I am committed to working with the Northern Ireland parties, with the Irish Government as appropriate, and with representatives of victims and survivors, to build on the progress made during the talks. The UK Government is determined to resolve the outstanding issues that are preventing the establishment of the legacy institutions set out in the Stormont House Agreement.
This will be an independent body designed to enable victims and survivors privately to receive information about the Troubles-related deaths of their next of kin. As set out in the Stormont House Agreement, and building on the precedent of the Independent Commission on the Location of Victims’ Remains, the ICIR will be an international body. To that end, the UK and Irish Governments have signed an international agreement to enable the establishment of the ICIR and to set out its functions. Today I have placed a copy of this treaty in the libraries of both Houses.
The ICIR will be an important institution which will help victims and survivors to seek information which it has not been possible to obtain by other means. Engagement by families with the ICIR will be entirely voluntary. Information provided to the ICIR about deaths within its remit will not be admissible in court, something which families will always be told in advance. The ICIR will not, however, provide any form of amnesty or immunity from prosecution.
This Government believes in the rule of law and would not countenance such a step. As the Stormont House Agreement set out, information provided to the ICIR will be protected but no individual will be protected from prosecution if evidence is obtained by other means. It is the Government’s intention that the legislation needed to implement the ICIR will contain provisions clearly setting this out.
It had been our aim to lay the treaty before Parliament at the same time as introducing the legislation required to establish the legacy bodies. However, as agreement has not yet been reached on this legislation, this is not possible. Once any treaty is formally laid, Parliament has a period of 21 sitting days, in which it can resolve that the treaty should not be ratified, in accordance with the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. I believe that it would be best if this consideration took place alongside the legislation, which will contain more detail about how the ICIR will function. I propose therefore formally to lay the treaty once we are able also to introduce legislation. These particular circumstances mean that placing a copy of the treaty in the libraries of both Houses is an appropriate way to ensure that Parliament is aware of the text of the treaty, without instigating the formal process of consideration.
In addition to the ICIR, the Stormont House Agreement envisaged the establishment of the Historical Investigations Unit, the Oral History Archive and the Implementation and Reconciliation Group. Together, this set of institutions provides the best opportunity to help Northern Ireland deal with its past and provide better outcomes for victims and survivors, the people who we must never forget suffered more than anyone else as a result of the Troubles. The Government is committed to implementing the Stormont House Agreement and to establishing the legacy bodies it contains. I will continue to meet victims’ representatives and others over the coming days and weeks to discuss these matters and to build support for the new institutions.

Mary Creagh,"Conference, in 2010 no-one knew what a foodbank was.
Well we do now.
I have spent the last nine months visiting foodbanks, where people collect and distribute food to families who cannot afford to feed themselves.
In 2012.
In Britain.
In Norwich, organiser Grant Habershon told me how demand at his foodbank had risen by 50 per cent compared to last year as more parents struggled to feed their children during the school holidays.
In Bradford, I packed a food parcel for a mum who skipped meals so her children could eat –dry toast with no jam.
In Harlow, in Skelmersdale, Halesowen, Dorset, the story was the same.
Cuts to lunch clubs, breakfast clubs, changes to tax credits and housing benefit are all forcing proud parents to rely on charity.
I saw the daily struggle of families to put a hot meal on the table.
And I learned about the work of churches, and charities like the Trussell Trust, FoodCycle and Fareshare.
The Trussell Trust will feed 200,000 people this year.
FareShare feeds 36,000 people a day through their network of 700 charities.
We are the seventh richest nation in the world yet we face an epidemic of hidden hunger, particularly in children.
Working families relying on charity for a daily meal.
But there is more than enough food to go round. Food is not the problem. The problem is a Tory-led Government making the wrong political and economic choices.
A Government so out of touch that their farming minister didn’t even know the price of a pint of milk.
A cost of living crisis.
But what is the cost of hunger?
Hunger costs millions in poorer educational results for children too hungry to concentrate in class.
Hunger costs millions in lost productivity.
This is the poverty trap. This is the real cost of hunger.
Last year, Conference, I asked you to join ‘Back the Apple’, our campaign to save the Agricultural Wages Board, to protect the pay and conditions of rural workers in England and Wales.
I am pleased to say that, despite the Tories and Liberal Democrats, voting to abolish the AWB, thanks to our campaign alongside Labour MPs, Unite the Union and the Welsh Assembly Government, the Government has not managed to get rid of it.
Today, 1 October, what may be the last Agricultural Wages Order comes into force. Today over one hundred and fifty two thousand farmworkers, fruit pickers, food packers will get a pay rise – thanks to you.
Next year, if the Tories have their way, they won’t.
But I will be working with my Shadow team to expose how out of touch the Tories and Lib Dems are with rural areas.
I want to thank my fantastic shadow Ministers Huw Irranca-Davies, Gavin Shuker, Tom Harris, in the Commons; Jim Knight and our very own dairy farmer John Grantchester in the Lords; our whip Susan Elan Jones; team PPS Chris Evans; and Fiona O’Donnell and Heidi Alexander who have now left the team.
And what have the Tories been doing in rural areas?
Youth unemployment rose faster in rural areas than in cities in the first two years of this Government.
Decimated rural bus services.
Delayed the roll out of universal broadband.
Making it harder to start and grow a business in the countryside.
So what can Labour do to tackle this cost of living crisis and create green jobs?
We have focussed on three big areas.
First, people are struggling to pay their water bills.
Bad debt adds £15 a year to everyone’s bill.
We want water companies to cut that bad debt by taking tough action on those who won’t pay in order to help those who can’t pay.
A Labour Government would force all water companies to offer social tariffs to help those most in need. But this Government wants to leave it to water companies to decide for themselves.
Second, we want the food industry to create the new green jobs that Britain needs.
The food industry is our largest manufacturing sector. It turns over £76 billion a year, with export earnings worth £12 billion pounds.
Big numbers, big opportunities.
The world will need to feed an extra billion people by 2025.
We need food security here at home and to export more to a world hungry for Great British food.
We want a fair deal on food.
That means a fair price for the milk that dairy farmers produce and a Groceries Code Adjudicator with real teeth.
Labour have been working alongside the Consumer Association for clearer pricing in supermarkets to ensure special offers really do offer a good deal.
Third, our strategy for new green jobs means we’ve got to stop talking about waste and start talking about natural resources.
Businesses need a secure supply of raw materials. They are struggling to source those materials in the UK as we export so much of our waste.
When we export waste, we export jobs. If we keep it here we keep those jobs in the UK.
We will raise our recycling targets and give waste processors the certainty they need to invest in new facilities and create new green jobs.
And in a world where food prices are rising and people are going hungry we think it is wrong that edible food goes to landfill.
We can create low carbon jobs collecting that food and getting it to people who need it.
But this Government just doesn’t have a plan.
Conference, families need a Labour Government that is on their side.
But even in opposition we can do our bit.
This Saturday, 6 October, I will be standing outside a supermarket in Wakefield with the whole Labour team asking people to donate one food item to FareShare’s Million Meal appeal.
You can join us by going to fareshare.org.uk. The twitter hashtag is #MealAppeal.
Across the country, hundreds of Labour MPs, councillors and party members will be doing the same.
Sign up to stand up at fareshare.org.uk.
We may not make the rules in government but we can still make the change we need on the ground.
Conference, Labour has changed.
Let’s show people we are the change the country needs.
"
Franklin Pierce,"To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith reports of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Attorney-General, in reply to a resolution of the Senate of the 24th of March last, and also to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 8th of May instant, both having reference to the routes of transit between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Republics of New Granada and Nicaragua and to the condition of affairs in Central America.
These documents relate to questions of the highest importance and interest to the people of the United States.
The narrow isthmus which connects the continents of North and South America, by the facilities it affords for easy transit between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, rendered the countries of Central America an object of special consideration to all maritime nations, which has been greatly augmented in modern times by the operation of changes in commercial relations, especially those produced by the general use of steam as a motive power by land and sea. To us, on account of its geographical position and of our political interest as an American State of primary magnitude, that isthmus is of peculiar importance, just as the Isthmus of Suez is, for corresponding reasons, to the maritime powers of Europe. But above all, the importance to the United States of securing free transit across the American isthmus has rendered it of paramount interest to us since the settlement of the Territories of Oregon and Washington and the accession of California to the Union.
Impelled by these considerations, the United States took steps at an early day to assure suitable means of commercial transit by canal railway, or otherwise across this isthmus.
We concluded, in the first place, a treaty of peace, amity, navigation, and commerce with the Republic of New Granada, among the conditions of which was a stipulation on the part of New Granada guaranteeing to the United States the right of way or transit across that part of the Isthmus which lies in the territory of New Granada, in consideration of which the United States guaranteed in respect of the same territory the rights of sovereignty and property of New Granada.
The effect of this treaty was to afford to the people of the United States facilities for at once opening a common road from Chagres to Panama and for at length constructing a railway in the same direction, to connect regularly with steamships, for the transportation of mails, specie, and passengers to and fro between the Atlantic and Pacific States and Territories of the United States.
The United States also endeavored, but unsuccessfully, to obtain from the Mexican Republic the cession of the right of way at the northern extremity of the Isthmus by Tehuantepec, and that line of communication continues to be an object of solicitude to the people of this Republic.
In the meantime, intervening between the Republic of New Granada and the Mexican Republic lie the States of Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, the several members of the former Republic of Central America. Here, in the territory of the Central American States, is the narrowest part of the Isthmus, and hither, of course, public attention has been directed as the most inviting field for enterprises of interoceanic communication between the opposite shores of America, and more especially to the territory of the States of Nicaragua and Honduras.
Paramount to that of any European State, as was the interest of the United States in the security and freedom of projected lines of travel across the Isthmus by the way of Nicaragua and Honduras, still we did not yield in this respect to any suggestions of territorial aggrandizement, or even of exclusive advantage, either of communication or of commerce. Opportunities had not been wanting to the United States to procure such advantage by peaceful means and with full and free assent of those who alone had any legitimate authority in the matter. We disregarded those opportunities from considerations alike of domestic and foreign policy, just as, even to the present day, we have persevered in a system of justice and respect for the rights and interests of others as well as our own in regard to each and all of the States of Central America.
It was with surprise and regret, therefore, that the United States learned a few days after the conclusion of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, by which the United States became, with the consent of the Mexican Republic, the rightful owners of California, and thus invested with augmented special interest in the political condition of Central America, that a military expedition, under the authority of the British Government, had landed at San Juan del Norte, in the State of Nicaragua, and taken forcible possession of that port, the necessary terminus of any canal or railway across the Isthmus within the territories of Nicaragua.
It did not diminish the unwelcomeness to us of this act on the part of Great Britain to find that she assumed to justify it on the ground of an alleged protectorship of a small and obscure band of uncivilized Indians, whose proper name had even become lost to history, who did not constitute a state capable of territorial sovereignty either in fact or of right, and all political interest in whom and in the territory they occupied Great Britain had previously renounced by successive treaties with Spain when Spain was sovereign to the country and subsequently with independent Spanish America.
Nevertheless, and injuriously affected as the United States conceived themselves to have been by this act of the British Government and by its occupation about the same time of insular and of continental portions of the territory of the State of Honduras, we remembered the many and powerful ties and mutual interests by which Great Britain and the United States are associated, and we proceeded in earnest good faith and with a sincere desire to do whatever might strengthen the bonds of peace between us to negotiate with Great Britain a convention to assure the perfect neutrality of all interoceanic communications across the Isthmus and, as the indispensable condition of such neutrality, the absolute independence of the States of Central America and their complete sovereignty within the limits of their own territory as well against Great Britain as against the United States. We supposed we had accomplished that object by the convention of April 19, 1850, which would never have been signed nor ratified on the part of the United States but for the conviction that in virtue of its provisions neither Great Britain nor the United States was thereafter to exercise any territorial sovereignty in fact or in name in any part of Central America, however or whensoever acquired, either before or afterwards. The essential object of the convention--the neutralization of the Isthmus--would, of course, become a nullity if either Great Britain or the United States were to continue to hold exclusively islands or mainland of the Isthmus, and more especially if, under any claim of protectorship of Indians, either Government were to remain forever sovereign in fact of the Atlantic shores of the three States of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras.
I have already communicated to the two Houses of Congress full information of the protracted and hitherto fruitless efforts which the United States have made to arrange this international question with Great Britain. It is referred to on the present occasion only because of its intimate connection with the special object now to be brought to the attention of Congress.
The unsettled political condition of some of the Spanish American Republics has never ceased to be regarded by this Government with solicitude and regret on their own account, while it has been the source of continual embarrassment in our public and private relations with them. In the midst of the violent revolutions and the wars by which they are continually agitated, their public authorities are unable to afford due protection to foreigners and to foreign interests within their territory, or even to defend their own soil against individual aggressors, foreign or domestic, the burden of the inconveniences and losses of which therefore devolves in no inconsiderable degree upon the foreign states associated with them in close relations of geographical vicinity or of commercial intercourse.
Such is more emphatically the situation of the United States with respect to the Republics of Mexico and of Central America. Notwithstanding, however, the relative remoteness of the European States from America, facts of the same order have not failed to appear conspicuously in their intercourse with Spanish American Republics. Great Britain has repeatedly been constrained to recur to measures of force for the protection of British interests in those countries. France found it necessary to attack the castle of San Juan de Uloa and even to debark troops at Vera Cruz in order to obtain redress of wrongs done to Frenchmen in Mexico.
What is memorable in this respect in the conduct and policy of the United States is that while it would be as easy for us to annex and absorb new territories in America as it is for European States to do this in Asia or Africa, and while if done by us it might be justified as well on the alleged ground of the advantage which would accrue therefrom to the territories annexed and absorbed, yet we have abstained from doing it, in obedience to considerations of right not less than of policy; and that while the courageous and self-reliant spirit of our people prompts them to hardy enterprises, and they occasionally yield to the temptation of taking part in the troubles of countries near at hand, where they know how potential their influence, moral and material, must be, the American Government has uniformly and steadily resisted all attempts of individuals in the United States to undertake armed aggression against friendly Spanish American Republics.
While the present incumbent of the executive office has been in discharge of its duties he has never failed to exert all the authority in him vested to repress such enterprises, because they are in violation of the law of the land, which the Constitution requires him to execute faithfully; because they are contrary to the policy of the Government, and because to permit them would be a departure from good faith toward those American Republics in amity with us, which are entitled to, and will never cease to enjoy, in their calamities the cordial sympathy, and in their prosperity the efficient good will, of the Government and of the people of the United States.
To say that our laws in this respect are sometimes violated or successfully evaded is only to say what is true of all laws in all countries, but not more so in the United States than in any one whatever of the countries of Europe. Suffice it to repeat that the laws of the United States prohibiting all foreign military enlistments or expeditions within our territory have been executed with impartial good faith, and, so far as the nature of things permits, as well in repression of private persons as of the official agents of other Governments, both of Europe and America.
Among the Central American Republics to which modern events have imparted most prominence is that of Nicaragua, by reason of its particular position on the Isthmus. Citizens of the United States have established in its territory a regular interoceanic transit route, second only in utility and value to the one previously established in the territory of New Granada. The condition of Nicaragua would, it is believed, have been much more prosperous than it has been but for the occupation of its only Atlantic port by a foreign power, and of the disturbing authority set up and sustained by the same power in a portion of its territory, by means of which its domestic sovereignty was impaired, its public lands were withheld from settlement, and it was deprived of all the maritime revenue which it would otherwise collect on imported merchandise at San Juan del Norte.
In these circumstances of the political debility of the Republic of Nicaragua, and when its inhabitants were exhausted by long-continued civil war between parties neither of them strong enough to overcome the other or permanently maintain internal tranquillity, one of the contending factions of the Republic invited the assistance and cooperation of a small body of citizens of the United States from the State of California, whose presence, as it appears, put an end at once to civil war and restored apparent order throughout the territory of Nicaragua, with a new administration, having at its head a distinguished individual, by birth a citizen of the Republic, D. Patricio Rivas, as its provisional President.
It is the established policy of the United States to recognize all governments without question of their source or their organization, or of the means by which the governing persons attain their power, provided there be a government de facto accepted by the people of the country, and with reserve only of the time as to the recognition of revolutionary governments arising out of the subdivision of parent states with which we are in relations of amity. We do not go behind the fact of a foreign government exercising actual power to investigate questions of legitimacy; we do not inquire into the causes which may have led to a change of government. To us it is indifferent whether a successful revolution has been aided by foreign intervention or not; whether insurrection has overthrown existing government, and another has been established in its place according to preexisting forms or in a manner adopted for the occasion by those whom we may find in the actual possession of power. All these matters we leave to the people and public authorities of the particular country to determine; and their determination, whether it be by positive action or by ascertained acquiescence, is to us a sufficient warranty of the legitimacy of the new government.
During the sixty-seven years which have elapsed since the establishment of the existing Government of the United States, in all which time this Union has maintained undisturbed domestic tranquillity, we have had occasion to recognize governments de facto, founded either by domestic revolution or by military invasion from abroad, in many of the Governments of Europe.
It is the more imperatively necessary to apply this rule to the Spanish American Republics, in consideration of the frequent and not seldom anomalous changes of organization or administration which they undergo and the revolutionary nature of most of these changes, of which the recent series of revolutions in the Mexican Republic is an example, where five successive revolutionary governments have made their appearance in the course of a few months and been recognized successively, each as the political power of that country, by the United States.
When, therefore, some time since, a new minister from the Republic of Nicaragua presented himself, bearing the commission of President Rivas, he must and would have been received as such, unless he was found on inquiry subject to personal exception, but for the absence of satisfactory information upon the question whether President Rivas was in fact the head of an established Government of the Republic of Nicaragua, doubt as to which arose not only from the circumstances of his avowed association with armed emigrants recently from the United States, but that the proposed minister himself was of that class of persons, and not otherwise or previously a citizen of Nicaragua.
Another minister from the Republic of Nicaragua has now presented himself, and has been received as such, satisfactory evidence appearing that he represents the Government de facto and, so far as such exists, the Government de jure of that Republic.
That reception, while in accordance with the established policy of the United States, was likewise called for by the most imperative special exigencies, which require that this Government shall enter at once into diplomatic relations with that of Nicaragua. In the first place, a difference has occurred between the Government of President Rivas and the Nicaragua Transit Company, which involves the necessity of inquiry into rights of citizens of the United States, who allege that they have been aggrieved by the acts of the former and claim protection and redress at the hands of their Government. In the second place, the interoceanic communication by the way of Nicaragua is effectually interrupted, and the persons and property of unoffending private citizens of the United States in that country require the attention of their Government. Neither of these objects can receive due consideration without resumption of diplomatic intercourse with the Government of Nicaragua.
Further than this, the documents communicated show that while the interoceanic transit by the way of Nicaragua is cut off, disturbances at Panama have occurred to obstruct, temporarily at least, that by the way of New Granada, involving the sacrifice of the lives and property of citizens of the United States. A special commissioner has been dispatched to Panama to investigate the facts of this occurrence with a view particularly to the redress of parties aggrieved. But measures of another class will be demanded for the future security of interoceanic communication by this as by the other routes of the Isthmus.
It would be difficult to suggest a single object of interest, external or internal, more important to the United States than the maintenance of the communication, by land and sea, between the Atlantic and Pacific States and Territories of the Union. It is a material element of the national integrity and sovereignty.
I have adopted such precautionary measures and have taken such action for the purpose of affording security to the several transit routes of Central America and to the persons and property of citizens of the United States connected with or using the same as are within my constitutional power and as existing circumstances have seemed to demand. Should these measures prove inadequate to the object, that fact will be communicated to Congress with such recommendations as the exigency of the case may indicate.

Joe Biden,"You have to fight the cancer of corruption.
Said, “No.” I said, “We’re not going to give you the billion dollars.” They said, “You have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said” … I said, “Call him.” I said, “I’m telling you you’re not getting the billion dollars.” I said, “You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here.” And I think it was what, six hours? I looked at … I said, “I’m leaving at six hours. If the prosecutor’s not fired, you’re not getting the money.” Well, son of a bitch got fired, and they put in place someone who was solid at the time.
"
Donald Trump,"Yes. And he's a great gentleman. He was a great mayor, one of the greatest, maybe the greatest mayor in the history of New York. He was a fantastic prosecutor. I know nothing about him being under investigation. Somebody said -- I heard a report today. I don't -- I can't imagine it. He's a man that looks for corruption.
And whatever he does, I really believe he's a totally -- I mean, I know, he's an honorable man. You know him very well, too, Jeanine.
Well, I just don't know if there is an investigation. I've just heard it.
A lot of things -- I find a lot of things that you hear, they should look at other people. They shouldn't be looking at -- they should be looking at really bad people doing really bad things to our country. So, no, I stand behind Rudy Giuliani, absolutely. He was...
Again, he was a crime-fighter from day one.
Well, I don't know who they are. I mean, I guess maybe I met them or maybe I took pictures with them, because I saw there was a picture of me with them and others. But I take pictures with a lot of people. I don't know them. I don't know who they are, Jeanine. But you will have to figure that one out for yourself, I guess.
I know they are donors, because they made donations -- political donations to a lot of different people, a lot of different politicians, I guess, over the years. So they are donors. But I have many donors, thousands and thousands of donors.
Well, I don't know exactly the status. I don't know what she said because the Democrats keep that very much under the vest. It's very interesting how they don't tell us anything. We literally have no rights on the other side. We have no rights, we have no anything. And it's a very unfair situation, I think.
But I don't know very much about her. I know that supposedly she was very partisan and she was a Clinton-type person. But whether or not she keeps the job, I'd leave that up to Mike Pompeo.
I do.
It's absolutely my choice. And, again, she may be a very fine person. I just don't know. But even if you listen to the very good conversation that I had, a very, very good, no-pressure, congenial conversation with the new president of Ukraine, he had some things that were not flattering to say about her.
And that came out of the blue. So, you know, it would be nice to have somebody that he liked because he's going -- the person will have to deal with the president of Ukraine. But she may be very good. I just don't know much about her. I don't think I've ever met her.
Well, you know, they just -- if you take a look at it where Adam Schiff made up a phony, fraudulent statement, and he read it as though I said it, because my phone call was a perfect call with the president of Ukraine. It was congenial. It was friendly. It was no pressure. It was no blackmail, as he said.
There was no pressure, no blackmail, no nothing. They don't even understand what the question is. And people that read it don't know what the problem is, because there was no problem. What the problem is though, that Adam Schiff didn't read that. He read something that was -- he made up something, fraudulently made up a conversation.
And he read it to Congress. And he read it to the American people. And it was horrible. But it was a fraudulent thing that he just -- out of thin air he made up, Jeanine. It was a terrible thing that he was allowed to do that. And that's where we are right now. And very strong action should be taken against this guy because I've never even heard of a thing like that.
Now, where we really upset the apple cart, they didn't think we'd do this, I released the conversation.
You had stenographers. It was a call that was taken, very accurately taken. When I released the call, that really turned things over because now they saw that it was a perfectly fine call. It was a very standard, very nice call. And that's the way it is, Jeanine. And it was -- it's a fraud that's being perpetrated on the American people by Adam Schiff, by Nancy Pelosi.
She was on George Stephanopoulos the other day. And she tried to say that I made that call. And I -- in other words, the way Schiff had it.
And even Stephanopoulos, I respect him for what he said, no, no, he didn't say that, that was made up by Adam Schiff. It was all made up.
The whole thing is a hoax. It's a terrible thing. But it's a fraud on our country. And it's so bad for our country.
Right. That's probably why she...
-- is not calling it. She maybe -- she can't get the votes because we're doing so well now. I'm -- you know, on Thursday, I was in Minnesota. We had an arena the size of Madison Square Garden that was packed.
And we could have sold it out many times. Last night, I was in Louisiana. We had a fantastic arena. We could have sold it out many times. It was packed. It was also broadcast, I guess, on FOX and other networks. We've never had a level of enthusiasm. I was called by the great pastors of this country in a call about a week ago.
And they said they have never seen electricity in the air, enthusiasm in the air. Churches are joining. People are joining the church. They have never seen anything like what's happening. That's because everybody knows the Russian witch hunt was a faux, phony fraud. And we got rid of that. And then they came up with this Ukrainian story that was made up by Adam Schiff.
You know, I guess he was a screenwriter or something, failed. But that's what it is. He made up my conversation. How can you be worse than that? And then they say he has immunity from prosecution because he delivered it in Congress.
Well, I don't think he should have immunity for that. I've never heard of a fraud like that.
Well, it's incredible, the way the media sticks up for him. They say it's unsubstantiated. And yet it's not. He walked away. And I guess the new number is 168,000 a month into -- between him and his friend, like 168,000 a month. But whether it's that or 50,000 a month, also I hear there was a payment of $3 million.
And he knows nothing about energy. He knows nothing about oil. Nothing. Zero. You know more than he does. And he walked away with millions of dollars, because of what? It's just illegal. You can't do it. And then he goes into China. And I just finished a great negotiation --
Hopefully it gets papered down.
But one of the --
-- great negotiations for our farmers and bankers and everybody. But the farmers, it's so incredible. I dealt with very powerful people in China, great negotiators, very tough people. They don't give you a billion-five for nothing. He walked out with $1.5 billion out of China. I said, these are not the same people that I've been dealing with.
So he goes into China, takes $1.5 billion, and Wall Streeters, I've asked the biggest people on Wall Street, is that possible? They all said, no, it's not possible. It's a payoff.
It's a total payoff. And the press doesn't want to pick it up --
-- just like the most -- and then you have Joe Biden on television -- I can't imagine why he said this, talking about how he got rid of the prosecutor, that they didn't get rid of the prosecutor, that they weren't going to get this vast amount of money, large amount of money. And he said, boom, the prosecutor was gone.
That is called quid pro quo.
I think he's hiding.
I think he knows all about it. And we are talking about investigate the investigators. We're talking about the beginning. And it was really before I took office. It was -- if you look at the insurance policy with Strzok and Page, just in case she should lose, we've got an insurance policy. That's what all this stuff has been about, the insurance policy.
These are bad people. These are evil people. And this was the insurance policy. The two lovers, Strzok and Page. Two beauties.
And it's a terrible thing, what they do to this country. Terrible. But we are winning. And we're winning big. And the American public knows it. And that's why I think they want to stay away. But they can do whatever they want. But they want to stay away. If you look at what's happening, Jeanine, if you take a look, the electricity for the Republican Party, they are so angry at what has taken place.
Because, as an example, everybody knows that Schiff -- we call him ""shifty Schiff"" -- he made up the story. He made up my phone call.
And based on that phone call, this is what this whole thing is about. It's all about a phone call. And the call is perfect. I have given that call to everybody to read it. In fact, Lindsey Graham made a statement. He said, I never knew you were so nice.
I'd tell you, I think they are more honest, if you want to know the truth.
I think that they don't stick together as well. And I think -- you know, I have a 94, 95 percent approval rating with the Republican Party. We have great, great relationships with the people in the Republican Party. But they don't fight dirty. As an example, with subpoenas -- you take a look at Paul Ryan when he was speaker.
He wouldn't give them.
I'm not even knocking him for that. He wouldn't give them. He said it was inappropriate to give them. Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, all of the guys wanted, Gaetz, all of them, Matt Gaetz. I mean, I could name 25 incredible -- these are incredible people. They wanted subpoenas to investigate all of the corruption that they found, horrible, horrible corruption.
Paul Ryan would say, well, wait a minute, slow down, let's come back next week. They come back, they wouldn't get it. She hands them out like it's cookies.
It's maybe a difference in philosophy? Maybe they don't do it because they think it's bad for the country. Because what she is doing is very bad for the country. They've committed a fraud. They made up a phony conversation. They got caught. And the reason they got caught is because they never thought I would release the transcript of my conversation with the president of Ukraine.
They never thought -- because --
-- it's something you don't want to do. We actually called up Ukraine, Mike Pompeo, called up Ukraine to get permission to do it. They thought it was an unusual request, but they said sure. It was a very fine conversation. There was no problem. But if you want to use that, you can. They probably look at us, they say, what's going on? What is that all about?
But we actually -- because I would have to do that. Not legally have to. But I would feel badly doing it. You know how bad that is? Everybody that speaks now to the president of the United States is going to say --
-- I wonder if I'm going to be broadcast all over the world, my little conversation about something.
It's so bad.
I know all about it. I have known about it for a long time. I know the subject better than anybody.
And a lot of people disagree, but in the end, I'll be right. And, you know, the Kurds have been fighting with Turkey for a long time. The Kurds are some very good people, some very bad people, some -- if you look at PKK, they are among the -- you know, a tough, tough group of people, let me put it that way.
And I didn't fight. I told them, I won't get involved. When Iraq -- about a year and a half ago, you remember, was going to fight against the Kurds, and I said, wait a minute, we've spent all of these trillions of dollars, we fight with Iraq, should have never been in the Middle East, by the way, and I always said it, it was a mistake to be in.
There were no weapons of mass destruction. But Iraq was going to fight the Kurds. And I said, nope, we are not going to take either side, because we had just been fighting for Iraq and now they want to us fight against Iraq and fight for the Kurds -- and you know what, the Kurds left. They never took up the fight.
Then they left a second time. They never took up the fight. And it looks like now, they may leave a third time and that's OK. Maybe they will get somebody else to go in and fight with them. If they want to get somebody else to go fight with them, that would be fine. It would OK with me. But we want to get out of the endless wars.
We'll be stuck there forever, Jeanine, forever. We have to get out of the endless wars. They say I'm a disrupter, let me disrupt.
We have to get out of the endless wars. I see our incredible soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital. I gave out Purple Hearts on Friday to people that were decimated. I speak to parents that have lost their children. I give letters to -- it's time. It's 7,000 miles away from the United States. I want to protect our borders.
I want to protect our borders, Jeanine.
It had nothing to do with it. He was going to go in anyway. Jeanine --
-- they've been fighting the Kurds for 200 years.
He was going in anyway. The U.S. -- it wasn't the 50 troops. And, we basically -- those troops were going anyway. We have nobody there. We defeated ISIS. We did a favor. And then I said to Europe, take your ISIS fighters back, Germany, France, U.K., all of them. They didn't want to take them back. I said, well, we're not going to hold them.
But they are so used to treating the United States so badly. I said, take your fighters back. We did you a big favor. We captured them, take them back. They didn't want to take them back. So I said, well, you know, somebody is going to have to take them, because we are not bringing them back to Guantanamo Bay.
We are not going to bring them back. We're not going to take them. We did everyone a great favor. We took 100 percent -- we defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. And if I didn't do it, if I -- believe me, it was a mess when I took over.
I also rebuilt our military. But we are not going to stay in these areas forever. You know, we were supposed to be in -- we were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was 10 years ago.
We are bringing our soldiers back home.
And if somebody else wants to fight with the Kurds against Turkey, or if the Kurds want to move a little bit, move around. Right now, they are doing what they did with Iraq. And Turkey wants to create a border. Now, Turkey also knows, because I got back Pastor Brunson, you remember that.
I did a lot of damage to their currency in order to get him back. If we have to do something, if Turkey is out of line in what they are doing, really out of line, I will do something because our economy is so powerful now. When I took over this country two and a half years ago, almost three years ago, we would have been second to China in a very short period of time.
Now, we are so far ahead of China, you wouldn't believe. We picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in worth and China has gone down many trillions of dollars in worth.
We're way ahead.
And we will use our economic force, if we have to, against Turkey.
OK. That's a good question. I'll tell you where the other NATO countries are. They're not paying their bills, that's where they are. So out of 28 countries, 20 of them are delinquent. They don't pay their bills. I got them to pay $100 billion more. Secretary General Stoltenberg said -- he is my biggest fan in the whole world.
He said, until I came along, they weren't paying their bills. The United States was paying for NATO. And NATO protects Europe. And say what you want, NATO protects Europe. Maybe it's a little bit good for us, but we pay 4.3 percent and Germany pays one percent. And Germany is supposed to be paying two percent.
And we protect all of these countries in Europe, and on top of everything else, they are delinquent. And on top of that, they don't want to take back the ISIS fighters that we captured.
Yes, a number of days ago.
And I know he has been building up for a year on his border. They have a tremendous unlimited amount of soldiers because, you know, Turkey is right there. It's their border. And they have been fighting with the Kurds for many years, for centuries, they've been fighting with the Kurds. And it's like some people go to lunch, that's what they do, they fight with the Kurds.
It's time for us to leave. We're going to leave. And you know what, if the Kurds can find somebody else or if the Kurds move around, look, with Iraq, everybody wanted me to fight with the Kurds against Iraq. I said, wait a minute, we just won -- we just had a war where we spent all of this money on Iraq, in my opinion largely wasted, because there were no weapons of mass destruction, et cetera, et cetera.
But now we are supposed to fight against them? I said, no, we're going to stand aside, let them fight. Well, the Kurds left, they didn't fight. And then they left a second time. I made a good decision. I got no credit for it and that's fine. Well, now I'm making a similar decision. And, frankly --
-- we've spent a lot of money on the Kurds. We have given them --
-- tremendous weapons. We've given them ammunition. But it's time for to us go home. We want to defend our country. We also have to be --
-- very strong. We'll have a good relationship with Russia. We'll have a good relationship with China. You see the trade deal, that's an indication. We made a great deal for our farmers and others.
But you know what? We have to be prepared for that, the bigger picture. We have to.
We are rebuilding our military, Jeanine. I spent $2.5 trillion on rebuilding. When I came in, we had no ammunition two and a half years ago.
The general told me, sir, I'm sorry, we have no ammunition. And no president should ever be in that position.
Well, I think it's a hoax. And I think if they do, they're going to suffer at the ballot box, because the only thing impeachable is the fraud --
- that Adam Schiff committed on the American people...
-- because he made up a conversation. He made a conversation that didn't exist.
He never thought in a million years that I was going to release the real conversation. And when it did, the whistleblower turned out to be totally inaccurate, meaning you can make your own determination. They say a lot of things about the whistleblower. They protect him. I think we have to find out who the whistleblower is that would give all this false information.
And also --
-- Adam Schiff, something has to be done. How can somebody stand up before Congress and make a speech about my conversation --
-- word-for-word reading my conversation? And it's a fraud. He made it up himself.
Yes.
No, but, you know, I just enjoy doing it. We are doing so great for the American people. We have the strongest economy we've ever had. Even China, when they came in on Friday, I met with the vice premier, he said congratulations on the incredible job you have done with the economy. I'm telling you, Jeanine, China was going to catch us in a very short period of time.
And now, we are so far ahead of China. And he knows it and he respects it, frankly. They respect it. It's one of those things.
But we've rebuilt our military. We've cut everybody's taxes. Our vets are happy now. We got them choice. We got them accountability where you can now fire people that mistreat them.
These are things that couldn't be gotten for five decades. They could never be gotten, I got them all. Nobody has done what I have done and yet I've had this horrible cloud where these people, these horrible people, these really dishonest people that have to hate our country, they have to hate our country, because the Russian witch hunt was a hoax.
-- and the Ukraine thing is a hoax.
And what they have done to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace. They want to impeach him. And they have nothing. These people, they just want to influence him. They don't want to impeach him. They want to influence him. So I'm energized by it, Jeanine, that's it.
I mean, I have no choice because I have to do it for the country.
Thank you very much, Jeanine, thank you.
"
Donald Trump,"Hi, Greta.
Well, I got a call from the people at Newsmax, which is a great group, and the Ion folks, who I guess they reach 100 million people, a very large television network. And they came to see me and asked whether or not I'd be willing to do it. And it is a little bit of a change and a little bit of something different for me. And I said, yes, I would do it. I want to see what's going on. I mean, we want to get the right person in there.
There's no question about that. So I agreed to do it.
He has no chance of winning anyway so that's good because we can have more time for the people who are a serious candidates. And the other thing is Governor Huntsman called my office asking for a meeting and I didn't call him back, which I could have and should have. But he called my office asking for a meeting, and I'm sure, being a Mormon, he will absolutely confirm that.
So that's one of those things. I don't know about the other candidates, but I think most of them would want to do it. I think it would get high ratings and we have some very serious questions.
I don't know Governor Huntsman. I like him. He seems to be a nice man. I just don't know him. And frankly I don't like his policy on China because he wants to us roll over. His policy on China is so weak I couldn't possibly endorse him. So he would be one of the people I would have been able to endorse under any circumstances.
It's sometime after the debate. Newt is coming up to see me on Monday morning. But I won't be doing an endorsement before the debate, but after the debate, sometime after the debate, I would be certainly going to do that.
I really think we should stop with all the formalities. I watch the different moderators get up and explain what the debate is about. It's a waste of time. A debate is a debate. We'll have a debate on the issues. We'll be talking about things like, as an example, OPEC, where nobody is talking about OPEC at the debates, or very little.
China. India, other countries that are just taking our lurch right out of our mouths, and it's a terrible thing that's happening to this country. So we'll be talking about very important issues and talking about social issues and environmental issues maybe to a lesser extent, but we'll be talking about environmental issues and talking about lots of different things.
But one of the big things I believe and one of the big reasons that everybody comes up to my office is because I do have millions of people that agree with me, that the rest of the world -- you know, it used to be the opposite. But now the rest of the world is just absolutely taking advantage of the United States, and that should not be happening.
It sounds like it would be on the way. There is no question about that. No, look, News Max is a very powerful organization. Ion is I think the number one private television network and reach over 100 million people. I think it will do very well. I can understand why Jon Huntsman won't partake. I have been a little harsh on him, harsh on his views on China.
I heard him two weeks ago during one of your debates talking about China and it was like a total rollover. And that's not what we need because they're taking the money right out our pockets. And we can't allow that to happen. So it's possible that others might not do it, but it's also possible that everybody will.
We'll probably have a very large audience.
I don't think he would say no. He is a very smart man. He knows, and whether people like it or not, I get very high ratings on television. That's why I have had a show so successful for 12 seasons.
I think they'll show up. They're smart and know we have a huge audience and will show up. This is a serious debate. Some said, this will be ""The Apprentice."" The fact is this is a serious debate, and a lot of people will be watching and I do believe they will mostly show up.
Well, I think they're going to like it. I think they're going to watch it. I think we're going to ask some questions that haven't been asked, some important question. Little credence has been given to the outside world and what the outside world is doing to this country and to our great country. And I think that's going to be a big part of the debate.
There will be other issues we discuss and we'll discuss all the main issues. But I think we're going to have a large audience and some very good questions.
Absolutely. I wrote beautifully about your in my book, so I have no choice.
I reveal one thing right now. I speak very well of Greta, OK? That one thing I can reveal. I have just broken something. The publisher must be furious. I say great things about you, and I mean it.
Thank you, Greta.
"
Margaret Beckett,"By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone”
Those words from the Party’s membership card have been coming into my head all week since I saw in a recent newspaper article the reported comments of a pensioner. Asked what she wanted from this Labour Government – what kind of future she sought, she called for a better quality of life – greater security, good healthcare, safer streets, less vandalism.
It’s what she wanted for herself. It’s what we want for every citizen because that is only fair – fair and right and just.
As that pensioners comments revealed, the public face of public services for the great majority of Britons starts at their front door. That public face may not be of our schools, unless there are school age children in the family. For the majority it may not immediately be healthcare unless there is a current experience of ill-health. But for each and all of us it is the condition of our streets, and open spaces. It’s litter, graffiti, abandoned cars or even discarded chewing gum. It’s vandalism experienced or even just feared.
These are the things that blight all of our daily lives, which make us feel more insecure. Yet we know that all of these things are beyond the reach of any of us as an individual. They require that common endeavour.
Government’s role is to provide local authorities and others with powers and funding to help address these problems in the communities where they occur, working with those closest to them, community groups, the police, youth services and local businesses.
We cannot just will this change from Whitehall but the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill, for example, will give local authorities new powers to tackle fly-tipping, graffiti and noise.
If we are to meet the challenge set for us not only by that pensioner but by the millions of our fellow citizens at home and across the world who share her ambitions for their own lives, we must strive to overcome the divisions which beset our communities.
Above all, we must achieve this in international climate change negotiations. I believe this to be the predominant challenge of our time – the challenge that dominates our future, no matter what else may befall. And though that challenge will affect us all, it will affect first and most the most poor and the most vulnerable. Even if we act now, with as much boldness and effectiveness as we can summon, the science tells us that, for example, by the end of this century 20 million more people are likely to be affected by flooding every year- most of them in developing countries. If we do not act that figure will be at least 90 million.
We and other developed countries accept that while everybody has a part to play and must find ways of playing that part, we the developed countries have a duty to act earlier, to make a greater contribution, to shoulder a larger part of the responsibility – because we can. That is fairness. It is also international solidarity in practice.
The contribution of Britain’s scientists and the lead taken by our government as well as personally by the Prime Minister has brought us huge international respect.
But none of us have taken more than the very first steps on a long long road. Agreeing the Kyoto Protocol and its legal framework laid the foundation but there is much much more to do to match the scale of the challenge we face.
President Putin acknowledged that challenge today. We are in no doubt that it is in the interests of the whole world, Russia included, for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force with Russian ratification. It is also strongly in Russia’s economic interest.
But as I say we must do more. That is why in our Energy White Paper this year we set out on a long-term path for Britain – we set the goal of reducing our carbon emissions – the main source of climate change – by around 60% by the year 2050 – the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. It is at the heart of our pursuit of a low carbon economy. In Britain we have already shown that economic growth and emission reduction can be achieved side by side. We do not need to choose between them. Carbon emissions fell 13% between 1990 and 1999, while the economy grew by 28%. In fact in many cases environmental gain can bring economic benefits. Companies and individuals saving carbon are companies and individuals saving money.
There is one other area I want to raise, which people do not often mention when you ask them about their quality of life, perhaps because wrongly we take it too much for granted. That is the way Britain looks and is. Our landscape. Our forests. Our rural environment. And what that means to all of us in terms of leisure opportunities and tourism.
The creation of DEFRA strengthens the link, between the quality of our landscape and our quality of life. We are developing agri-environment schemes for farmers which reward them for improving landscape and biodiversity. We’re considering the creation of two new National Parks in the New Forest and South Downs. River water quality is at an all-time high. Wild bird populations are at their highest level since 1990. And there are more trees in England than there have been for 100 years.
And this is just the beginning. For decades the structure of the Common Agriculture Policy with its powerful and direct links between levels of production and subsidy was providing a perverse incentive to undermine much of what we most value, about what is after all a managed landscape – 70% of it farmed.
Incidentally it was the perverse incentive to overproduction which also led to us dumping our surpluses on world markets, undermining the prosperity of farmers in many developing countries.
The dramatic changes which we can make as a result of the recent historic agreement on CAP reform stem from breaking that fundamental link between production and subsidy levels. They offer us an opportunity to work towards the goals set for us by the Curry Commission at the beginning of this Parliament – a more sustainable agriculture which is better for consumers, taxpayers and farmers – as well as being better for our environment.
That reform deal formed the basis for our approach to the recent WTO talks in Mexico, where for the first time the world community as a whole sought trade deals whose over-riding purpose was to improve the long-term prospects for developing countries.
At those talks there was the opportunity to maintain the momentum created by the Millennium Development goals, the Monterrey finance agreement the Johannesburg Summit and the many practical partnerships for development that it launched.
Sadly, in Mexico that opportunity was not seized. I am well aware that many who passionately support the cause of development believe that this is for the best. I hope more than I can say that their tactics and their optimism prove to be justified. What I profoundly fear is that we are in danger of irrevocably damaging the prospects for sustainable development which will be of most worth to those who need it most. There is a terrible risk that major players in many different parts of the world will judge that country to country deals could serve them almost as well. Yet it is only through multilateral processes that we stand any chance of protecting the interests of the smallest and the most weak.
So it is internationally as well as at home that we must all strive for real improvement in the quality of life for all.
The issues brought to mind by that phrase are fundamental to our well-being. Few of them are easy to tackle or to overcome. But real benefit to human health and happiness follow from addressing them successfully. And as I said at the outset that can only be a common endeavour. Perhaps after all it’s not “the economy stupid”. It is the quality of life.

Justin Trudeau,"Hello everyone,  
Before we get started, I want to touch briefly on the unfolding events in Portapique, Nova Scotia.
I know we’ve all been watching this on the news.
My heart goes out to everyone affected, in what is a terrible situation.
I want to thank the police for their hard work, and people for cooperating with authorities.
I want to wish a happy Orthodox Easter to everyone who is celebrating today.
Even if it’s just over Skype, I hope you can spend this special day with family and friends.
Although this pandemic has affected everyone, some people have been hit especially hard.
Right now, too many Canadians are facing some really difficult situations.
If you live with a disability, I don’t have to tell you what this can look like.
You might be worried about whether your support worker will be able to keep coming.
You might be concerned about getting groceries or about your finances.
And if you’re caring for someone with a disability, you’re probably anxious about getting support, too.
Your voice matters.
Your experience is important.
And our government is listening.
If this crisis has laid bare the gaps that still exist for far too many Canadians, it has also given us an opportunity to address them.
It has encouraged us to have even more meaningful conversations about how we make our country a more inclusive, and a more equitable place.
Last week, Minister Qualtrough launched a COVID-19 Disability Advisory Group as part of our plan to keep all Canadians healthy, informed, and safe.
We’re addressing key issues like equal access to healthcare and information, as well as support on jobs and income.
And we’re doing all of this work with you at the table.
On that note, I want to recognize the outstanding organizations right across the country, like the Rick Hansen Foundation, that are bringing these issues to the fore.
You are doing incredible work, and we are proud to be your partner.
In response to the pandemic, we have developed a three-point economic plan to help Canadians get through this tough time.
We introduced the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to help people who’ve lost their wages, we brought in new loans for businesses, and we introduced the wage subsidy.
But there is still work to do.
There are still people to reach.
That’s why, this past week, we expanded the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to include workers making up to $1,000 a month, seasonal workers, and those whose EI regular benefits have recently run out.
It’s why we put in place new measures to support people in the energy industry, which is suffering right now.
And we also brought in support for people who continue to do incredible work in the arts, culture, and sports communities.
And it’s why we have kept making progress with the provinces and territories on increasing wages for essential workers who need it.
Now, things are tough for employers, too.
So we brought in a whole range of additional support, on loans and credit, and for Indigenous businesses and businesses in the North.
And for communities that need extra support, we approved requests to have the Canadian Armed Forces assist in Quebec long-term care facilities, as well as in Nunavik and in Basse-Côte-Nord.
Today, I can announce that we have also approved the extension of a request from the Government of Quebec, for the Canadian Rangers to help NEW-tash-kwan and Eh-KWAN-eh-chit First Nations near Basse-Côte-Nord.
All these measures we’ve brought in are about helping you do the things that will get us through this.
And it’s working.
We’re seeing the numbers trend in the right direction.
So we need to keep doing what we’re doing, and keep being extremely careful.
And we will get through this together.
That said, although we’re seeing encouraging trends, we need to be realists.
Across the country, thousands of families are living through dreadful situations and having heart-wrenching moments because of this pandemic.
I would like to take this time to express my condolences to those who are in mourning.
Every Canadian shares your sorrow and stands with you through this terrible hardship.
Know that the government is there for you, and we will get through these difficult moments together.
It’s hard to watch the news without thinking about these seniors in their homes who can’t see their children or their grandchildren, except through FaceTime, and who are afraid.   
Who see the news about the situation in seniors’ centres across the province, across the country. They are worried and left wondering whether they’ll ever see their children and grandchildren some day.
It is extremely difficult and we must do everything for them by working together, and also by emphasizing that we must continue to stay home, we must continue to stop the spread of this virus, and together we’ll get through it.  
And because it’s Sunday, I want to end again by talking directly to all the kids who might be watching.
This week is National Volunteer Week.
That means we say thank you to everyone around us doing things like helping seniors get groceries, or putting in a shift at a foodbank.
You can join in from home too.
Ask your parents if you can help them make dinner and do extra cleaning around the house.
Help your brother or sister with schoolwork.
Say hi – over FaceTime – to your grandparents, who I know are missing you.
Young, and young at heart, we can all make a real difference.
I heard a great story the other day about a restaurant in Nova Scotia, The Canteen.
They’ve turned their restaurant into a community kitchen, where people pitch in and get meals to those in need. 
And there have been thousands of Canadians who have already signed up through our National COVID-19 Volunteer Recruitment Campaign, to lighten the load on our frontline workers.
Everyone can help out. Everyone can help us get through this.
And right now, as we face a challenge like none we’ve ever known, we all have a chance to contribute.
And I know that we will all continue to do our part.
Thank you very much.

Theresa May,"It is great to be able to welcome you here to Downing Street this evening for Burns Supper, this is the second one I have had the pleasure of hosting.
This house of course, has been the home of Prime Ministers of Great Britain and then of the United Kingdom since 1732, 25 years after the Acts of Union that created that single kingdom of Great Britain. So from the start, this house has been symbolic of that union.
It is important to me in everything we do here, and indeed in everything we do as a government, that we reflect the fact that the United Kingdom is a union of four nations. Our country has great diversity within it and we rightly celebrate that diversity. What we actually do in coming together is combine to make something greater than the sum of its parts and it is something that is unique and inspiring.
Of course, Scotland is an absolutely integral part of our United Kingdom – economically, socially and culturally.
Tonight of course in Robert Burns, we are celebrating a Scottish and British cultural icon, one of the finest poets in any language. It is a chance to celebrate a great poet, a great nation and an enduring union. Have a really good evening.
"
Chester Arthur,"To the House of Representatives:
Having watched with much interest the progress of House bill No. 6242, entitled ""An act making appropriations for the construction, repair, and preservation of certain works on rivers and harbors, and for other purposes,"" and having since it was received carefully examined it, after mature consideration I am constrained to return it herewith to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, without my signature and with my objections to its passage.
Many of the appropriations in the bill are clearly for the general welfare and most beneficent in their character. Two of the objects for which provision is made were by me considered so important that I felt it my duty to direct to them the attention of Congress. In my annual message in December last I urged the vital importance of legislation for the reclamation of the marshes and for the establishment of the harbor lines along the Potomac front. In April last, by special message, I recommended an appropriation for the improvement of the Mississippi River. It is not necessary that I say that when my signature would make the bill appropriating for these and other valuable national objects a law it is with great reluctance and only under a sense of duty that I withhold it.
My principal objection to the bill is that it contains appropriations for purposes not for the common defense or general welfare, and which do not promote commerce among the States. These provisions, on the contrary, are entirely for the benefit of the particular localities in which it is proposed to make the improvements. I regard such appropriation of the public money as beyond the powers given by the Constitution to Congress and the President.
I feel the more bound to withhold my signature from the bill because of the peculiar evils which manifestly result from this infraction of the Constitution. Appropriations of this nature, to be devoted purely to local objects, tend to an increase in number and in amount. As the citizens of one State find that money, to raise which they in common with the whole country are taxed, is to be expended for local improvements in another State, they demand similar benefits for themselves, and it is not unnatural that they should seek to indemnify themselves for such use of the public funds by securing appropriations for similar improvements in their own neighborhood. Thus as the bill becomes more objectionable it secures more support. This result is invariable and necessarily follows a neglect to observe the constitutional limitations imposed upon the lawmaking power.
While feeling every disposition to leave to the Legislature the responsibility of determining what amount should be appropriated for the purposes of the bill, so long as the appropriations are confined to objects indicated by the grant of power, I can not escape the conclusion that, as a part of the lawmaking power of the Government, the duty devolves upon me to withhold my signature from a bill containing appropriations which in my opinion greatly exceed in amount the needs of the country for the present fiscal year. It being the usage to provide money for these purposes by annual appropriation bills, the President is in effect directed to expend so large an amount of money within so brief a period that the expenditure can not be made economically and advantageously.
The extravagant expenditure of public money is an evil not to be measured by the value of that money to the people who are taxed for it. They sustain a greater injury in the demoralizing effect produced upon those who are intrusted with official duty through all the ramifications of government.
These objections could be removed and every constitutional purpose readily attained should Congress enact that one-half only of the aggregate amount provided for in the bill be appropriated for expenditure during the fiscal year, and that the sum so appropriated be expended only for such objects named in the bill as the Secretary of War, under the direction of the President, shall determine; provided that in no case shall the expenditure for any one purpose exceed the sum now designated by the bill for that purpose.
I feel authorized to make this suggestion because of the duty imposed upon the President by the Constitution ""to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient,"" and because it is my earnest desire that the public works which are in progress shall suffer no injury. Congress will also convene again in four months, when this whole subject will be open for their consideration.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's so nice. Isn't he a great guy? He doesn't get a fair press. He doesn't get it. It's just not fair. And I have to tell you, I'm here and very strongly here because I have great respect for Steve King. I have great respect, likewise, for Citizens United and David and everybody, and tremendous respect for the Tea Party.
Also -- also, the people of Iowa. They all have something in common, hard working people. They want to work. They want to make the country great. I love the people of Iowa. So that's the way it is, very simple. With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a President who is doing an absolutely terrible job.
The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems, we've caused. Our President is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible. In any event, Washington is broken and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray.
Very simple. Politicians are all talk, no action. They're all talk and no action. And it's constant. It never ends. And I'm a conservative -- actually, very conservative and I'm a Republican, and I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians because they let the President get away with absolute murder.
You see always, ""We're going to do this, we're going to--"" Nothing ever happens. Nothing ever happens. You look at Obamacare, a total catastrophe. By the way, it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster. People are closing up shop. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.
He said, ""I have more accountants than I have patients."" And he needs because it's so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before, and he's going to close up his business. And he was, you know, very successful guy. And it's happening more and more. But you look at Obamacare with a five billion dollar website.
I have many websites, many, many websites. They're all over the place. It's like for $10. OK? Now, everything about Obamacare was a lie. It was a filthy lie. And when you think about it, lies, I mean, are they prosecuted? Does anybody do anything? And what do the Republican politicians knowing about it? He lied about the doctor, he lied about every single aspect.
You can keep your plan, and you've all heard that hundreds of times. That's like the state -- the -- the real estate, location. Look, I don't even say it anymore because everyone goes location, location. But you have heard this about Obamacare and it's disgraceful. It's a big, fat, horrible lie. Your deductibles are going through the roof.
You're not going to get -- unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage. And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore. So it's a real, real disaster. And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare, and they have to do it fast and not just talk about it. Now, we have to build a fence, and it's got to be a beauty.
Who can build better than Trump? I build. It's what I do. I build. I build nice fences, but I build great buildings. Fences are easy, believe me. I saw the other day on television, people just walking across the border, they're walking. The military is standing there, holding guns, and people just walking right in front, coming into our country.
It is so terrible, it is so unfair, it is so incompetent, and we don't have the best coming in. We have people that are criminals. We have people that are crooks. You can certainly have terrorists. You can certainly have Islamic terrorists. You can have anything coming across the border. We don't do anything about it. So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border.
Again, the politicians talk about it. They do nothing about it. Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi, everything is Benghazi. What happens? Nothing. IRS, e-mails, I get sued all the time. OK? I run a big business. You know, I've always said, it's very, very hard for a person that's very successful -- I've done so many deals, almost all of them have been tremendously successful.
You'll see that when I file my statements. I mean, you will see. You'll be very proud of me, OK? But I've always said and I've said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone President because you've done so much.
You've beaten so many people. You've created so many -- and look, Obama, what did he do? No deal. He never did a deal. He did one deal, a house. And if you did that house, you'd be in jail right now, OK? He got away with murder. But I can tell you, e-mails, IRS, the e-mails, thousands of them. They were lost.
They were lost. If you were in my world, you would know e-mails can't be lost. They can't be lost. So why aren't our Republican politicians finding out where those e-mails are? They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about, well, we have to stop the border. That's the end of it. Believe me, if I did something, you would have a border that would be great.
But they talk about it and then you have a President that does an executive order. Nobody even heard of an executive order. He doesn't exempt to let people come in, and nobody does anything about executive orders. Why didn't they go to court and ask for a declaratory judgment, which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing.
And he's been saying it for a long time. He said, ""I'm going to approve this and that."" Why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts, because you could have started the process six months earlier. Instead, they have a very weak lawsuit that probably by the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now, everyone's going to forget about it. We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.
So we have to do something. Jobs, China, I mean, I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese. One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese. And they respect me for it. And I know them. And they say, ""We can't believe what we're getting away with. We can't believe how stupid your leaders are."" They -- they told me that.
Now, they don't know I'm going to go on to make a speech about it, but why not? But they tell me that. And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much goods, I mean, you -- the goods you sell are incredible. I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries in the euro.
. I never thought they'd have the guts to do what they're doing. They are devaluing down to nothing. And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product. It's going to make it impossible for you to compete. And they're getting away with it. And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it. But you watch, this devaluation of all of it. I mean, the euro, China, Mexico, everybody is devaluing.
And when you hear the dollar's getting stronger, it sounds good. You know, it's one of those things, sounds good, be very careful. Be very careful. Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing. They have it set. Don't forget, another thing, China became the number one economic power a year ago.
That was unthinkable. To think that that was going to happen. It was absolutely unthinkable. So it happened and it's very, very sad. Now, we've spent two trillion dollars in Iraq. We got nothing. They don't even respect us. They don't even care about us. Until they started getting their ass kicked, then they call, ""Please come back and help us."" We want you out.
We want you out. Then all of a sudden, a new group forms, ISIS. By the way, you know how they form? They took the oil. And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump, there are some of you, have I been saying for four years, ""Keep the oil.
So we get nothing. We have two trillion dollars and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands. And we have -- what do we have? I mean, I -- I walked down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people. And we have to help those people. We have to help our vets. We have to help our military.
We have to build our military. But -- and we have to do it fast. We have to do it fast. We have incompetent people. They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing. It needs money. We have to make our country rich again so we can do that so we can save Social Security because I'm not a cutter.
I'll probably be the only Republican that doesn't want to cut Social Security. I'm not a cutter of Social Security. I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded and Medicare and Medicaid. Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud. But you deserve your Social Security. You've been paying your Social Security.
And -- like I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about, you know, cutting Social Security. And by the way, the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue. It's an issue that you're not going to win. You've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military and all of the other things.
Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons. We really do have to get strong and we have to get strong fast. We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon. We can't do it. Can't do it. We cannot let that happen. You know, in the old days, I would have said, 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, ""Pull out.
Let them fight each other."" Here we are in Syria, we're fighting people that want to overturn Syria. Think of this, we're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government. Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, OK? But think of it. No, think of it. ISIS is fighting them and we're bombing the hell out of them.
But we want Syria to fall. There's so many things -- there's so many things. But the one game changer that we have to be careful with that we never really had to think about too much before other than a certain number of years ago is the nuclear. Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniform shooting rifles.
You can take out the east coast of this country. You can take out large sections of the Midwest. You can take out things that were unthinkable, the power. And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever happens. We've never had this before. We have a situation in Afghanistan. We're spending tremendous amounts of money there.
We're trying to do the right thing. We have a leadership. Again, no leadership respects us. You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, OK? That's one thing you're going to fuck. The same thing is happening there. And I never knew that Afghanistan, until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals.
Different, not the oil, but minerals. And we're fighting here. And on the other side of the mountain, China is taking out all the minerals. They're taking it out, trillions of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals. So we're fighting here and they're taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much, sucker.
It's really, really crazy. So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country. If we don't -- the other day, in Ohio, a bridge collapsed. Bridges are collapsing all over the country. The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable. What's happening with our infrastructure? I go to Saudi Arabia.
I go to Dubai. I'm doing big jobs in Dubai. I go to various different places. I go to China. They're building a bridge on every corner. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff. They're building the most incredible things you've ever seen. They're building airports in Qatar which they like to say cutter, but I've always said Qatar.
So I'll keep it Qatar, what the hell. But they're building -- they're building an airport and have just completed an airport, the likes of which you've never seen. In Dubai, an airport the likes of which you've never seen. And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes. The place is falling apart.
You go into the main terminal and they have a terrazzo floor that's so old, it's falling apart and they have a hole in it and they replace it with asphalt. So you have a white terrazzo floor and they put asphalt all over the place. This is inside, not outside. And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.
In fact, my pilot said, ""Mr. Trump, this is such an honor."" I said, ""It's not an honor. They're just smart."" But you look at LAX and you look at Kennedy Airport and you look at our airports, generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling. You look at all of the things that are bad. I'll give you an example.
And this is in part of what I was going to say. But I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guardrails, you know, the guardrails, the ones that sort of go like this that are always bent, rusted, and horrible. Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes, and they've been selling this thing for 25 years.
Why isn't somebody stop them and get something that works because they don't know -- they don't know what's happening. Somebody made a lot of money on that. They don't know what's happening. So we have to make our country great again. We have to rebuild our country and we have a long way to go. We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.
Now, we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it. We owe it to other countries. They're the ones that hold the debt, and then we give them money. We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies. I just ordered thousands of television sets, and between LG and Samsung, and I mean, you know, no American company comes to see and comes to bid.
It's South Korea. Now, whenever they have a problem with North Korea, we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes. We're going to protect them. What are we doing? Why aren't they paying us? Why aren't they paying us? What are we doing? I ordered thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason, South Korea.
You know, whether it's China, South Korea, but, in this case, televisions, South Korea. And why aren't they doing something to justify what's going on? Now, we have a very important election coming up. We have a presidential election coming up and we have some good people. Nobody like Trump, of course, but these are minor details.
We have some good people. It can't be Mitt. Because Mitt ran and failed. He failed. Man, I liked him. Look, like him, dislike him, the 47% statement that he made, that's not going away. The Romneycare from Massachusetts is not going away. What do you think? They're going to say, ""We won't bring that up this time.
It's not fair because it was a long --"" That doesn't work. But more importantly, he choked, something happened to him in the last month. He had that election won. And let me tell you something, that election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close a deal. I know many of those guys."" And -- or a golfer that can't sink the three footer to win the tournament.
And there are many of them. Most people are like that. I mean, most people are like that. You can't give somebody another chance because, actually, I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president. I really do. I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true.
So you can't have Romney. He choked. You can't have Bush. Now, I made that statement very strongly and now everyone says the last thing, you know, they copied it and then, you know, I. I. But I said it. I was the one that said it first, and I mean it. The last thing we need is another Bush.
Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core. That's a disaster. It's bad. It should be local and all of it. But he's totally in favor of Common Core. He's very, very weak on immigration. Don't forget, remember statement, they come for love. I say what? Come for love. You got these people coming, half of them are criminals.
I mean, they're coming for love? They come in for a lot of other reason and it's not love. And when he runs, you got to remember, his brother really gave us Obama. I was never a big fan. But his brother gave us Obama because Abraham Lincoln coming back from the dead couldn't have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months.
And then he appointed Justice Roberts, and Jeb wanted Justice Roberts, and Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes. So you can't have Jeb Bush, and he's going to lose. Aside from that, he's not going to win. So Mitt -- and -- and you just can't have those two.
. It's so simple. So just in summing up, and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important and I watch these teleprompters, and by the way, I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter.
Because we got one that uses teleprompters and people say, ""He's so quick on his feet."" He's reading it. I mean, give me a break. Everything's read. You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk, and that's what we ended up getting, the king of teleprompters.
But -- so when I look at these things here, I say, ""You know what, it's so much easier. No problems. Get off stage. Everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that. But we -- we have to do something about these teleprompters. But in -- in looking at the insi -- the situation, I built an incredible company, and you'll see that.
An incredible company, a wonderful company. I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing. And in the certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and it would be so easy to fix. We have such great potential. So if I run for President and if I win, I would totally succeed in creating jobs, defeating ISIS, and stopping the Islamic terrorists.
And you have to do that. Reducing the budget deficit, so important, have to do it. Securing our southern border, and I mean seriously securing. Stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere. Saving Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people.
And it's not fair to future people coming up. And we can do it. Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country. And believe me, there are plans that are so much better for everybody and everybody can be covered.
I'm not saying leave 50% of the people out. Everybody can be cove -- this plan is just a basic disaster, nobody knows. As bad as the website was, that's how bad the plan itself is. Fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports, and that I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump.
I just got best hotel in North America. I'm building, which is sort of interesting. Think of this one. I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress, right on Pen -- the Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama.
You believe that? And everybody wanted it, so I can't believe it myself, but it's going to be fantastic. And so many other things. I know what needs to be done to make America great again. We can make this country great again. The potential is enormous. And I am seriously thinking of running for President because I can do the job.
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Beautiful. Thank you.

Chris Skidmore,"The Government have repeatedly made it clear that we absolutely value international exchange and collaboration in education and training as part of our vision for a global Britain. We believe that the UK and European countries should continue to give young people and students the chance to benefit from each other’s world-leading universities post exit.
Over the weekend, the media reported on a leaked Cabinet document discussing Government policy on EU student access to finance products for the 2020-21 academic year and beyond. At this time, I want to tell the House that no decision has yet been made on the continued access to student finance for EU students. Discussions at Cabinet level are ongoing and should remain confidential. I will make no comment on this apparent leak, which is deeply regrettable.
Students from the EU make a vital contribution to the university sector. It is testament to the quality and reputation of our higher education system that so many students from abroad choose to come and study here. As I stated earlier, since 2017 EU student numbers are up 3.8% and non-EU student numbers are up by 4.9%. In July 2018, we announced that students from the European Union starting courses in England in the 2019-20 academic year will continue to be eligible for home fees status, which means that they will be charged the same tuition fees as UK students and have access to tuition fee loans for the duration of their studies. Applications for students studying in academic year 2020-21 open in September 2019 and the Government will provide sufficient notice for prospective EU students and the wider higher education sector on fee arrangements ahead of the 2020-21 academic year and the subsequent years, which, as I have just stated, will obviously reflect our future relationship with European Union and the negotiations on that going forward.
"
Gordon Brown,"The times we’re in make this one of the most important conferences the Confederation of British Industry has convened.
So let me first of all thank you for your contribution to British business and the British economy.
Your dynamism, your resolution and your resilience – the hallmarks of your success – have never been needed more.
Together we can take the British economy through difficult times and equip ourselves for our global future.
Let’s just remind ourselves of the scale and speed of what’s been happening. $25 trillion dollars erased from global share values, world oil prices, having peaked at nearly $150 dollars a barrel, sinking by two-thirds, and reflecting big forces at work – the rise of Asia, a global capital market, the global sourcing of goods and services.
Quite simply: we are making the transition from the old world of sheltered national economies to the new world of a fully open global economy.
And the challenge is for each of us, in the spheres of influence we have, to surmount the risks and insecurities – and manage the teething troubles – of this new global age, while not losing sight of the vastly increased opportunities it brings.
Let’s name one of the great challenges: the global financial system. Even if there had been no systemic banking crisis, we have come to a time when the global flows of capital need to be complemented by a global — not just a nationally-based — framework of supervision.
Challenge number two is that of finite global resources: even if there had been no oil spike, our over-dependence on oil, the problem of climate change and indeed global food shortages would have to be addressed by new policies.
Challenge number three is global restructuring and global inequalities: even if there had been no cyclical rise in unemployment, all of us would have to deal with the consequences of a more specialist international division of labour and the resulting restructuring of jobs, and for Britain that means investing in the new talents and skills required for the technological and creative industries.
Some might want to take a narrow and insular view of today’s global crisis – some would say that the best we can do is to let the recession take its course, and that there is no alternative but to muddle through.
But there is another way of looking at it:
– whatever the troubles of this year and next, we are in the midst of a transition to a truly global economy which in twenty years is likely to double in size.
– with 1 billion or so new skilled jobs being created, we want to attract our share of that flow of new jobs.
– together we must ensure that British companies will benefit from the new opportunities as Asia becomes a market not just of millions of producers — but of millions of consumers too.
Whatever else we do – as everyone here will know – we have to prepare and equip ourselves for what the world is becoming. investing in our talent and skills, in our technological infrastructure and in our capacity for innovation. the high value-added products and services – that are Britain’s best guarantee of a successful global future.
And yes, the transition is difficult, but the prize for Britain is great – provided we can meet and master the challenges we face as we adjust to these new worldwide forces.
And I believe we are well-placed:
– we are a free trade country
– we have the most open economy in the world
– we have a global reach greater than any other country on earth
We understand that protectionism does not work – for economies or for workers: that better than simply protecting people in their last job, is helping people into their next job.
And so to all those who try to prove, by pointing to this crisis, that globalisation and global markets do not work our answer is very clear:
– the route to prosperity is not protectionism but an open, free-trading,
– flexible globalisation which must also be inclusive and sustainable.
So I am here to speak up for open economies
Our task is not to reject global markets but to repair and strengthen them for the future.  Not to condone excessive and irresponsible behaviour, but to reward hard work, enterprise and responsible risk taking.
But extraordinary times require extraordinary action. If we have learnt anything in these last tumultuous and unprecedented months, it is that this is not the time to become prisoners of the old dogmas of the past. All over the world, policy makers are leaving behind the orthodoxies of yesterday so — just as we set aside conventional thinking to invest directly but temporarily in the banking system — we now face the same challenge in monetary and fiscal policy – and for two reasons.
Worldwide, the orthodoxy of the last few decades, has been that monetary policy is the only effective instrument for economic management. But the financial system that is a key channel of monetary policy has been damaged. So monetary policy cannot be our only tool. Monetary policy must play its essential role, but it would be a mistake to rely entirely upon it to pull the economy quickly out of this downturn.
And there is a second reason for the urgent action we propose. ever since the second world war, one of our greatest problems —and our greatest constraints on policy —–has been the risk or reality of high inflation.  every framework for British economic policy has had to be focussed on the containment of inflation.
But now after many years of inflationary pressures – this last year with sharp rises in global commodity prices – we face today the opposite threat: the prospect of rapidly declining inflation.
So, as the chancellor will set out later today – and indeed as the leaders of the g20 countries agreed last weekend in America – a new approach to macroeconomic management is now needed if we are to get through this unprecedented global financial recession with minimum damage to our long term economic prospects:
An approach which combines the use of monetary policy with proactive fiscal policy to support economic activity
An approach which because of our low public debt supports demand in the economy with all of the instruments at our disposal while maintaining – not cutting – our programme of investment and reform for long-term benefit.
Richard, in your letter you argue – rightly in my view – for a substantial time limited fiscal injection into the economy. And as you say in your pre budget report submission, it is right to promote action now that can prevent permanent damage tomorrow.
Simply letting the recession run its course, to say there is no alternative, is not an option.
We have seen in previous recessions how a failure to take action at the start of the downturn has increased both the length and depth of the recession.
That was the mistake made in the recessions of the 8os and early 90s. the mistake made by the Japanese and the mistake made in the Asian crisis.
To fail to act now would be not only a failure of economic policy but a failure of leadership.
Doing ‘too little too late’ would mean more damage, more deterioration – the loss of vital businesses – a weaker economy, lower growth, eventually greater fiscal problems and in that event, higher interest rates and higher taxes.
The best way for taxes to be low in the long-term is for us to ensure that the downturn is as limited in length and scope as possible. And that means help when help is needed. Not when it is too late. A boost to the economy to sustain growth that will help to keep businesses open and protect people’s jobs and homes.
And a temporary fiscal stimulus is just that – temporary.
But to act now means we also have a duty to set out what we will do later. by showing we will take the necessary decisions in the medium term to guarantee stability, we can act today in a strong, decisive and fair way.
And we must ensure that we get the greatest value for every pound we spend. I would like to thank four senior business leaders – Gerry Grimstone, Patrick Carter, Martin Read and Martin Jay – who have in the last five months used all their business expertise and experience to leave no stone in Whitehall unturned – as we demand further ambitious improvements in government efficiency. the chancellor said in the budget that we must go beyond the 30 billions of efficiency savings already budgeted and that is why we will be announcing further improvements in efficiency.
For it is a broadly based economic recovery, combined with prudent tax, spending, and asset sale plans over the medium term, that will help us bring the government borrowing back down over the coming years.
Other countries too have agreed or are preparing to agree a fiscal stimulus, including America where debt is already higher than ours and where the deficit is already rising to high levels.
And just as coordinated international action is necessary to address climate change, energy security and global poverty, so too it is essential to co-ordinate interest rate cuts and fiscal policy, magnifying their impact, as called for by the G20 leaders.
So coordinated action on economic recovery will benefit Britain. And a coordinated approach in Europe, our largest trading partner, would be of most benefit. That is why I have been discussing with other European leaders how we can best work together.
But I also believe that – while the downturn may be difficult and especially difficult for countries which have large financial sectors, like ourselves – our economy today is better equipped to weather any global economic storm than it was in the 1970s, 80s or early 90s:
Because – with your productivity growth, your resilience, and your success, British business has achieved the fastest growth in average productivity in the past decade across the whole of the G7.
And we will continue to make the changes in regulation and laws necessary to have the best environment to do business.
And we are better equipped today also:
Because of Bank of England independence and now falling interest rates;
Because of the most flexible labour market in Europe – and because we are now making further changes to make it a condition for people on benefits to seek not just work but the skills for work;
And because – vital to our ability to invest publicly now – our national debt is considerably lower than a decade ago; and lower than all the G7 countries except Canada – so there is scope for the government to increase borrowing at the right time to support the economy.
And I believe we are also making the right long term decisions for our economy- not shirking the difficult decisions in planning, skills, flexibility, infrastructure and transport.
For the way forward is not just one isolated initiative or one individual measure, not even a set of measures for a few months. It is a concerted and comprehensive plan that will give real help to businesses and families while at the same time preparing our economy for the future.
We now have a unique opportunity to do – in a twenty-first century way — what was done in the twentieth century by the new deal. As they built roads and bridges to create the infrastructure for the years ahead; we can use this period of adjustment to build both the technological base and human capital to equip us for the opportunities ahead.
So let me assure you that we will continue our programme of investment in the technological revolution ahead, in the talent revolution; and in the environmental revolution.
Now, at the very moment of an economic downturn is precisely when we need to step up our welfare reform and invest in our human capital – as many of you who recently put your names to the statement in the newspapers would agree.
Investment in intangible and knowledge assets – in ideas, brands, and research and development – all areas dependent on technology and innovation; all areas dependent on high value-added talent and skills. These will be a vital force in building Britain’s future high value-added competitiveness in the global economy.
And to ensure Britain can make the most of the opportunities in the environmental revolution, we will support investment in the low carbon economy. A worldwide market that could by 2050 be worth as much as $3 trillion per year. And which could employ more than 25 million people. Because I want Britain to benefit from these new jobs – with at least 1 million jobs in the green economy by 2030.
So we are taking action to respond to the immediate financial crisis; and we are putting in place reforms and investment to benefit from the longer term opportunities – so we are optimistic about the future of Britain.
For this is a time for resolution; and for solidity in responding to a unique financial crisis.
A time for powerful action to equip us for globalisation’s challenges – and in due course to reap its rewards
And a time for confidence that as real incomes pick up again next year and national and international  policies work through the economy, so we in Britain have the strength  — and everything it takes — to face the global storm — and emerge stronger.

Tessa Jowell,"When I ask my South London constituents what would improve the quality of their lives their list is long and varied.
They talk to me about jobs and pensions, freedom from fear, safer streets, more for young people to do.
But perhaps most touching of all is the young mum I know who is just starting a college access course so that her young daughter could have greater ambitions than she had ever had for herself.
So that her dreams can be within her reach, as they have never been for her mother.
Perhaps the greatest gift we can give to those who dream is the confidence and the means to have a go.
Achieving your best is intensely personal, but you cannot achieve it on your own.
Each of us, according to our own tastes, enriches our own life, with music, drama, art, books and sport.
And we do that with our families, teachers, coaches, friends, the community around us, to help us learn and understand.
So, when we talk about the importance of culture, we must also accept the responsibility to give everyone the opportunities that the few take for granted.
And when we talk of achievement, when we think of dreams coming true, nothing beats the Olympic Games.
Earlier this year we decided to bid for the Olympics and Para-Olympics to come to London in 2012, so let’s just pause to look at a few of the reasons why……
And one of those stars Steve Cram, is with us today and will address Conference in a few minutes.
We are bidding for the Olympics because they will showcase Britain as a can-do nation.
They will galvanise the regeneration of London’s East End.
They will give sport in Britain its biggest ever boost.
That’s why our Labour Government – with the support of the other political parties – has joined with the Mayor of London and the British Olympic Association to make this Bid.
Barbara Cassani, the Chair of the Bid, now has her team assembled and things are really moving.
This will be a bid to rival the best.  And we are backing it 100%.
Young people starting in secondary school now can aspire to be champions in 2012.
But we want everyone to feel that sport can be a vital part of their lives, regardless of their talent.
To enjoy sport for its own sake.
To compete and to excel.
And because a good sport policy is also a good education policy, a good health policy and good anti-crime policy.
This is not just talk.
We are putting in place the foundations in schools and communities, and building the ladder of opportunity to take the talented, whatever their background, as high as they can go:
– Reviving school sport, with 400 specialist sport colleges, and 3,000 sport co-ordinators, bringing competitive sport back into our schools.
– Boosting grassroots sport, first with £750 million of Lottery money for school and community facilities announced by Tony Blair three years ago, then with a further £100m for community sport halls announced this summer, and just three weeks ago the decision to give community amateur sports clubs mandatory rate relief.
– Bringing the best artists and creative talents into some of the most deprived schools in the country in our Creative Partnerships.
– Developing summer play schemes, with sport, music, dance and theatre helping our young people feel the pride that comes from learning new skills.
I’m proud that we brought back free entry to our museums, that the National Theatre and the Royal Opera House have brought in new audiences by cutting their ticket prices.
The Baltic Gallery in Gateshead packs in local people and tourists alike, free to all.
But as we know, equality of opportunity is a fine phrase for those who already have the will to succeed.
But for many, success in any field remains just a dream.
Our mission is to enable those who today can only dream, to have the chance to achieve their very best tomorrow.
To feel they were given a chance and the means to grab it.
Of course our Party exists to deliver prosperity, education, and good health for the many and not just the few, but we also exist to feed the imagination of the many as well.
It’s only fair that everyone gets the chance to enjoy the finest of music, of theatre, of dance, of film.
It’s only fair that everyone gets the opportunity to enjoy the sports of their choice.
Throughout Britain our towns and cities are increasingly recognising just what the arts and sport can do for their people, for their environments and for their economies.
Great cities, like Newcastle, Glasgow, Gateshead, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Cardiff, Leeds.
Wonderful cities, finding the vigour of their 19th Century boom years in the 21st Century’s creative industries.
Liverpool will buzz with excitement and its economy will get a terrific lift as European Capital of Culture.
Because cities that embrace the arts, sports, fine buildings, libraries and galleries, and yes, bars and clubs and sports venues, are cities worth living in.
And worth businesses moving to.
And in every part of Britain the Lottery is the cultural and sporting venture capital of our communities.
– The Eden Centre, transforming the Cornish economy.
– The Commonwealth Games legacy transforming East Manchester.
– The Laban Centre in Deptford.
– The Ikon Gallery in Birmingham.
Every constituency has received at least 50 Lottery awards.
From Village Halls to the Deep in Hull.
From play for children to plays at the National Theatre, the Lottery touches every community, every age group, every culture in the country.
This work goes on.
Take just one example, I’ve asked the New Opportunities Fund to talk to War Veterans groups about how their members might want to mark the 60th Anniversary of the most remarkable 12 months in our history, from D-Day to the Fall of Berlin.
I want to ask them how they would like their history remembered.
Projects that make their memories available to today’s young people.
That help us understand how today’s world was created by the sacrifices of a generation now in their 80s.
This is the Lottery people love.  They know that Lottery money is the people’s money, not politicians’ money.
That investment is building communities, changing lives, respecting differences, opening new doors.
There are many dividing lines between this Labour Government and the Tory alternative.
Under the Tories the Lottery neglected the most deprived areas and the most desperate communities.  We changed that.
The Tories cut investment in sport and the arts.  We changed that.
The Tories forced the sale of school playing fields.  We changed that too.
Because markets fulfil the demand of those who can pay, not the needs of those who can only dream.
Because equality of opportunity without a place for those who have never dared to aspire, is just a highway for the privileged.
Opening that highway to all is the task before us: it’s not only in health, education, transport and welfare that we must rise to the challenge of change, but in bringing real opportunity to those with talent wherever they may be.
And finally there is another message from the Olympic debate.
When we asked people whether they wanted us to bid, they made one thing very clear, they wanted us to give it a go.
They would forgive us for trying even if we didn’t win.
They understand the challenge.
But people want the best for Britain, and the best for their families.
They expect us to set the toughest targets and do our damndest to reach them.
But they won’t forgive us if we won’t even try.
"
Joe Biden,"Hey everybody. I have to tell y’all, it’s great to see you.
Hello Cleveland. Don’t jump. Folks, I was reminiscing as we drove to the station, I spent the bulk of my adult life driving to an Amtrak station. I commuted every day from Wilmington, Delaware to Washington DC when I got elected as a young Senator, right after my wife and daughter were killed, and I didn’t plan on staying in the Senate, but I agreed I’d stay for six months, a long time ago, and I started commuting and the fact is they tell me I’ve logged more than 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. So it’s good to be here. It’s not as fast as the helicopter, but I made a lot of family and friends on Amtrak. So I’m looking forward to getting on the train with you guys.
I want to start off by saying that it’s great to be in Ohio and with my so many friends, members of Congress, local elected officials. It’s an honor to be here with Tiffany. I know how hard it is for her. And I say I know, I was in the position of her children. My dad went through the same thing, Mr. Mayor. Back in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he lost his job. And I remember him walking up the stairs, making what I call that longest walk a parent has to make to tell a child that he’s going to have to leave. My dad didn’t have an eight hour ride. He only had a three hour ride, three and a half hour ride. He moved to Wilmington, Delaware. Took a couple of years before he could bring us back down to Delaware, come home every weekend, but to make sure that we’re all together again. It’s a hard slog. A lot of people have made that. And Tiffany, you’re a wonderful, wonderful mother, teacher, and the way you talk about your husband, he and I have something in common. We both married way up. I want to say that my dad, when he was, I apologize to Congressman Lamb, he’s heard me say this a lot, but my dad, when we moved back to Delaware, moved to Delaware, would say all the time to his children, my siblings and I, he’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s being able to look your child in the eye and say, it’s going to be okay. That’s what a job is about.” And Tiffany, when I think about your husband taking that job eight hours away, although it’s a hundred years ago, I think about my dad, and I imagine your husband has the same stamina, and you do, as my mom and dad did.
The fact is that last night’s debate, and this election, is supposed to be about you, Tiffany, about you and all the people I grew up with in Scranton, and people in Youngstown, and Claymont, Delaware, and all the people who make a difference. Does any President, does your President understand at all what you’re going through, what so many other people are going through? Question is does he see you where you are and where you want to be? Does he care? As he tried to walk in your shoes, to understand what’s going on in your life? Or does he just ignore you and all the folks all over America who are in a similar situation? I think he’s more than ignoring us. I look at things from Scranton’s perspective, he looks at from Park Avenue. I think he basically looks down on us. He judges us.
The fact is that I think that when he called our military, and I see we got some veterans here too, thank you for your service man, but when he called our veterans who lost their lives and served suckers and losers, I thought it was one of the most despicable things that I’ve ever heard a President say. Guys you are soldiers or a veteran, you served your country, like you did, like you did Connor, like my son did. What he does, he lies to you. He lies to you about exactly what’s happened. Does he lie to you when, like this president did to your husband, that all the workers at GM plant in Lordstown were going to be in good shape. You remember what he said?
And you said it to me, he said, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house because no Ohio factory will shut down in Donald Trump’s America.” He doesn’t pay his fair share, don’t worry about that. He doesn’t pay his fair share in taxes. He says that makes him smart. What does that do? What does that make you, Tiffany, make me, and millions of other hard working Americans, decent people who pay our taxes? Are we the suckers? Are we stupid because we go by the rules? He’s too weak to beat the pandemic. Cost him more than 200,000 American lives. That’s upended every part of our lives and hit working people particularly hard. Your businesses are closed and schools aren’t back to normal because Donald Trump hasn’t done his job.
He hasn’t pulled Congress together to provide real relief for working people, moms, and dads, and business owners. The fact is Congress has passed a significant recovery bill, but he’s too busy being in a bunker, or in his golf course to call them into the White House to work out an agreement. He told FEMA to cut off funding for school PPE, masks, and protective gear, because it’s not a national emergency. His response during the deadly pandemic is to try to take your healthcare away by asking the Supreme Court to strike the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. Wipe it out.
… the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, wipe it out, taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny you coverage for preexisting conditions. Now, because of COVID, lung scarring or heart problems is a consequence of having survived COVID. That could be the next pre-existing conditions affecting millions of people. Taking away Medicare benefits for seniors. Throw your adult kids off your healthcare insurance.
Think about his plan for your social security. The social security actuary said that if he follows through on his plan for social security, social security will be quote, “Bankrupt by 2023.” It clear that he not only cares about Wall Street and the super wealthy and the Fortune 500, he thinks they built this country. That’s why he wants another $30 billion tax cut for the hundred wealthiest billionaires in the country, who have already made $ 30 billion during this pandemic. So they’ll pay a lower tax rate than you do as a teacher, a factory worker, a firefighter, a nurse. He gave a tax giveaway for corporations and they moved jobs overseas to sell goods back to the United States. Here comes the train that he tried to make sure didn’t continue to run.
That’s the commuter. All right. But folks, look, he let big corporation jump in front of the line to get the recovery aid that Congress had passed while small businesses are struggling to say open. In the end, his measure of economic health is the stock market. In four years as president, he’s broken his promise, he’s forgotten the forgotten Americans he said he was always going to fight for.
Well, I never will forget. I know the middle class working people built this country and I measure our economic success by what families are talking about around their kitchen tables this morning. Some of them with an empty chair because they lost a family member. The ones I saw every night on my train ride from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, as I said after my wife and daughter were killed when I was first elected, I started going home every single night so I’d be there in the morning to get my kids, Beau Hunter and Ashley ready for school. Actually, Jill, God love her, she came into our life five years later and made things good.
For 36 years, I said, I took that 250 mile round trip journey each day. I’d get to know the train engineers, the conductors, the fellow passengers, and at night, I’d see the pinpoints of lights in the homes in the cities and towns along the way from Washington to Wilmington and wonder what those families are talking about after they put their kids to bed. My guess is the same thing that all Americans across the country are talking about today, asking questions as profound and as ordinary as, will we be okay? Will we be able to keep our insurance? What are we going to do?
Folks, this election has a choice between Scranton and Park Avenue values, between Cleveland and Park Avenue values, between Alliance and Park Avenue values. But it’s also about something deeper. Can these parents look their kids in the eye and say, ” Honey, everything’s going to be okay.” These are the conversations I’m going to be having today in this whistle stop tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, talking to folks about how I’ll get the virus under control, lay out the plan, bringing Congress together to provide relief and resources to schools and business so we can reopen our economy safely and strongly with a real plan and real leadership.
Talking to folks about how I’d create good paying jobs, union jobs, to support working families and build our economy back. Not just back, but build it back better.
I’ll fight for American jobs with the dignity of work and make the wealthy and corporations began to pay their fair share. I’ll protect your right to healthcare and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act and I’ll always tell you the truth. I’ll always care about you, whether you vote for me or not. If elected, I’m not going to be a Democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Whether you voted for me or not, I’m going to be your president and I’ll never forget the people, the working people of this country, because that’s what I’ve come from. That, given just half a chance, the American people can do anything. Just like you, Tiffany, and your husband, you’ve stood up. You can do anything. I want to make something absolutely clear. There’s overwhelming reason for optimism. Reverend, as you said, there’s overwhelming reason. We just have to unite. The country is ready to do that. We’re better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century, we just have to do it and do it together. So I leave you Rev and thank you for your invocation by saying, God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Keep the faith. We’re coming back. Thank you.

Joe Biden,"Our country was founded on an idea, “We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal.” We’ve never lived up to it. Jefferson himself didn’t. He held slaves, women were excluded, but once proposed it was an idea that couldn’t be constrained. It survived the ravages of the Civil War, the dogs of Bull Connor, the assassination of Martin Luther King and more than 200 years of systemic racism, and just weeks ago the murder of George Floyd. Through it all, these words have gnawed at our conscience and pulled us towards justice.
American history is no fairy tale. It’s been a constant push and pull between two parts of our character, the idea that all men and women, all people are created equal, and the racism that has torn us apart. We have a chance now to give the marginalized, the demonized, the isolated, the oppressed a full share of the American dream. We have a chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country. We have a chance to live up to the words that have founded this nation. This Independence Day let’s not just celebrate the words, let’s celebrate that promise and commit to work, the work that we must do to fulfill that promise. We remain locked in the battle for the soul of this nation, but believe me, truly, it’s a battle we can and we will win if we act together. Happy Fourth.
"
Gavin Williamson,"With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement regarding the wider opening of nurseries, schools and colleges as part of our response to the covid-19 pandemic.
It is now over two and a half months since we asked schools, further education colleges and nurseries to remain open only for vulnerable children and those of critical workers. I continue to be immensely grateful for the way that our teachers and parents have responded to these challenging circumstances. I would like to say a big thank you to all those working in education, childcare and children’s social care for the huge efforts they are making on a daily basis to support families and make sure our children do not miss out on their education.
We all know how important it is for children and young people to be in education and childcare, and it is vital that we get them back there as soon as the scientific advice indicates that we can. I am very pleased that last week we were able to take the first cautious step towards that. As the Prime Minister confirmed on 28 May, the Government’s five tests are being met and we are beginning to ease the lockdown restrictions across England. Based on all the evidence, this means that nurseries and other early years providers, including childminders, have been able to welcome back children of all ages. Pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 have been returning in smaller class sizes, alongside the children of critical workers and vulnerable children of all ages, who continue to be able to attend.
Ninety-seven per cent. of schools that submitted data to the Department for Education were open at the end of last week. Last week, we saw the number of primaries taking nursery, reception, year 1 or year 6 pupils steadily rise as part of the phased, cautious wider reopening of schools. By the end of the week, more than half of primary schools were taking pupils from these year groups, and as of yesterday that had risen to over 70% of primaries that had responded.
I know that schools need time to put in place the strict protective measures that we have asked for and we continue to work with the sector to make sure that any schools experiencing difficulties are supported to open more widely as soon as possible. Some schools, in areas such as the north-west, are concerned about local rates of transmission. I can assure them that SAGE’s R estimate for the whole of the UK is below 1. If robust data shows that local action needs to be taken, we will not hesitate to do so, but we are not in that position. I know that the House will be as impressed as I have been by the work and efforts of headteachers, teachers and childcare staff, who are finding ways to make the necessary changes while still ensuring that schools and nurseries are a welcoming place for children, as well as reassuring families who may be worried about sending their children back.
The next step of our phased approach will enable secondary schools and colleges to provide some face-to-face support from 15 June for years 10 and 12 and 16-to-19 students in the first year of a two-year study programme, who are due to take key exams next year. This is such a critical time for those students and this extra support ​will be in addition to their remote education, which will continue to be the main method of education for them this term, as only a quarter of this cohort will be able to attend at any one time to limit the risk of transmission. Children of critical workers and vulnerable children in all secondary year groups will continue to be able to attend full-time.
We have published guidance for secondary schools and ensured that schools have the flexibility to decide how they want to use face-to-face support in the best interests of their pupils. Since the announcement of our proposals on 10 May, my Department has published detailed guidance for settings on how to prepare. This includes planning guides for early years providers and primary schools, and further guidance for secondary schools and colleges. Crucially, we have provided detailed guidance on the protective measures that schools and other settings need to take to reduce the risk of transmission. This includes restricting class sizes, limiting mixing between groups and encouraging regular handwashing and frequent cleaning. This advice was developed in close consultation with Public Health England.
The safety of our children, young people and staff remains my top priority. That is why all staff and children, including the under-fives, will have access to testing if they develop symptoms of coronavirus. This will enable the right response where a case is confirmed, including using a test-and-trace approach to rapidly identify people most at risk of having been exposed to the virus, so that they can take action, too.
We continue to follow the best scientific advice and believe that this cautious, phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. While we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer, we continue to work with the sector on the next steps, where we would like schools that have the capacity to bring back more children—in those smaller class sizes—to do so if they are able to before the summer holidays.
We will be working to bring all children back to school in September. I know that students who are due to take exams in 2021 will have experienced considerable disruption to their education this year, and we are committed to doing all we can to minimise the effects of this. Exams will take place next year, and we are working with Ofqual and the exam boards on our approach to these. While these are the first steps, they are the best way to ensure that all children can get back into the classroom as soon as possible.
I want to end by thanking the childcare, school and FE staff who have gone above and beyond over the past eight weeks, and who are now working so incredibly hard to welcome our children and young people back, while also continuing to support those who remain at home. I commend this statement to the House.
"
Ian Murray,"I thank the Minister for his warm welcome at the Dispatch Box. I would rather that we were debating the debacle of Scottish football today, given his experience, which I am sure would be more amenable to our constituents. Perhaps we will get to one of those debates in future when we are back to normal.
My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Tony Lloyd), who had a very serious bout of coronavirus. He is now out of hospital and I have spoken to him. You will be pleased to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he has not lost any of his dry wit and sense of humour. We look forward to him being back in this place as quickly as possible.
I also thank the Minister’s wife. I had not realised that she was a serving police officer. I thank her and her colleagues for all that they are doing to keep us safe during the crisis, and not just during the crisis; police and other support staff keep us safe at all times, across not just Scotland but the rest of the UK.
We will work constructively with the Minister, his team and the Secretary of State when they agree with us and we will be a ferocious Opposition when they do not. We will work genuinely constructively when it is in the interest of the people of Scotland, but we will certainly scrutinise and hold both Governments to account for their decisions, because that is what they get paid for.
There is no disagreement this afternoon with regard to the order, which facilitates the retribution orders that the Scottish Government have put in place. It is disappointing that it has taken a bit of time to get here, but there is no better time than now to reassess how we punish those who assault our police officers physically, mentally or, as the Minister said in his opening remarks, by spitting during the coronavirus pandemic. It is time to get the legislation in place.
Retribution orders are useful tools for punishment and deterrence, and the fund that is developed is there for victims in the police service, and other associated people within the police, to seek retribution and have support. It is right for them to get that. We wish only that we did not have to have that kind of support for our police personnel, but we do, and we hope that it will reduce over the years.
It is also important, at this time, to look at the people who might be given a retribution order and how the legislation might affect them. There has been a massive increase in the uptake of universal credit. The unemployment figures released today are not a surprise, but will be a concern to us all. For people in receipt of a retribution order, this order will allow the retribution order to be deducted from their benefits.​
I have big questions to ask the Minister with regard to that. How will he ensure the affordability of those orders for benefit claimants, particularly when people are stretched, so that they will not be made destitute by them? Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions last year revealed that a quarter of a million people across the UK had been sanctioned on universal credit, and 5% of those had been sanctioned for longer than six months.
Can we be sure that any deductions from benefits will be taken into account if someone is sanctioned, in order for them and their families not to be put into destitution? That does not in any way dilute the seriousness of why they were given a retribution order, but it is important that it does not put families into destitution. How can the Minister and the Secretary of State ensure that any changes in legislation at the Scottish Government level are analysed and assessed on the basis of how the order will now work, if people are having deductions from their benefits and pay?
As I said, we do not disagree with the order. Ultimately, compensation for the victims of any crime goes further than its simple monetary value, particularly for crimes of assault on police officers. It can be of great significance as a real recognition of the crime that has been committed against the victim, as well as acknowledging the suffering as a result of any offence. Therefore, this is a necessary statutory instrument that will allow the justice system to work for victims by allowing them to see that the perpetrator’s actions have serious consequences, and will play an important role in victims’ recovery. We are therefore happy to support the order.
"
Donald Trump,"This is a great group. I know so many. Please, sit down. Please. So, I heard about this. Actually, for a couple of weeks, I heard about it. And I said, ""I have to do it."" Not much going on around the White House. But we have the great Ben Carson. Thank you, Ben. That's great that you're here.
Where's Dr. Drew? Where is he? Dr. Drew. Did I do your show. We had some good ratings, right? Congratulations. Everything going well? It's been a while. Right at the beginning of this whole thing, right? Good. Thank you very much for all you do. I want to just let you know how important it is -- the work you do and what you do. And I want to thank Joe for the job he's been doing.
It's incredible. Kellyanne, thank you so much. The White House Mental Health Summit -- so important. We've done things that a lot of people haven't done, but this is one of the things that we have to bring up to date. Because we're way, way behind, in our country, on mental health. And I think we've made a lot of progress in a short period of time.
We're grateful to Secretary Alex Azar -- done an incredible job. His son is with him today. Alex, where's your son? Look how handsome he is.
Because he's brought some things into the fore that have been really fantastic, Ben. So, thank you very much. Incredible job you're doing. And I'm not surprised. In the 1950s, there were over 250,000 -- but it's truly 550,000 -- could be, probably.
You know, there's no really accurate way of figuring it out. But these were people in mental hospitals and mental hospital beds in the U.S. By 2016, this number had declined to 37,679. They had a much more accurate number.
The first, they didn't really know. And the second, they knew: 37,000. Of the 11 million Americans living with severe mental illness, 4 million receive no mental health service of any kind. Four million people. There are more than one hundred and -- if you look at it, over 100,000 homeless individuals.
And I think that number has to be much, much higher than that, Alex. Wouldn't you think? They say over 100,000. You look at some states, they have over 100,000 -- one in particular-- homeless individuals with serious mental illness. And we must give major consideration to building new institutions. You know, when I was growing up in Queens, in New York, we had a number of mental institutions.
And I'd look and I'd see these big buildings. And all of a sudden, you go and you don't see them anymore. And you say, ""What happened to all of those beds? What happened to all of that work? And where are those people?"" And in many cases, those people are living on the streets. It's much different.
And somebody made the decision a long time ago and they did it for budgetary reasons, but we have to take care of our mentally ill. We have to help people that are having problems. But I see it. So many areas of -- in Queens and other areas; New York City -- you saw these massive buildings. In some cases, they did great work, I guess.
Not in all cases. But you don't have them anymore, Dr. Drew. You don't have them. They're gone. And you say -- and these are thousands -- tens of thousands of rooms. And you say, ""Well, we have more population now, and yet we have far less beds and rooms."" So we're doing something about it. At the same time, we need to keep very dangerous people off our streets.
And we want to take care of the mental illness, but we have a lot of very dangerous people on our streets. This week's funding bill provides $3.9 billion for mental health programs -- $3.9 billion -- an increase of $328 million. And my administration is focused on early detection, evidence-based programs, stopping the opioid epidemic -- which is an incredible problem.
Just the drug epidemic, period. You could say ""opioid,"" but you could still say ""drugs."" There's never been anything like it. And not only in this country, in all countries -- in almost all countries. And supporting our new law enforcement professionals, who are doing such a fantastic job. We're also doing screening for our vets for mental illness, which is something they haven't done.
Our vets are being taken care of now better than ever before. We had Choice passed. This was something they've been trying to get. For close to 50 years, they've been trying to get it. Veterans Choice -- where if you don't see a doctor fairly quickly, you can go outside, get a wonderful private doctor, and we pay the bill.
It's made such a difference. You don't see the problems that you were seeing at the VA. So, that's a tremendous thing. But we have to work on a lot of different things in that world. That's a big world -- between drugs, mental illness. It's all -- it all comes together as one big problem. And we're working on it very hard.
And many of the people in the room are the leaders on that. And I just want to thank you. That's why I wanted to come over and say hello and thank you -- because you do a job. You really are fully appreciated. You feel you are underappreciated because you don't see it. But I'll tell you: The people of this country respect you so much.
You have one of the toughest professions anywhere in the world, even tougher than Ben. And Ben's is tough."" That's tough. You've got housing and plenty of other things on top of it. You sort of have everything. But I just want to thank you personally for the job you do. It was really fantastic.
And thank you very much, all of you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
"
Lord Falconer,"Thank you for that kind introduction.
I welcome today’s opportunity to explain how the Planning Green Paper represents a genuine opportunity for local government.
We are keen to engage in dialogue with you on the Planning Green Paper.
I believe that the proposals in the Planning Green Paper will empower you to deliver a more effective and efficient planning system.
These two themes – empowerment and delivery – are crucial to achieving a planning system that is faster and fairer and more effective.
They are crucial to creating a planning system with community interests at its heart, but with barriers to economic development removed.
In order to achieve this kind of fundamental change, we need to empower local authorities to bring clarity, certainty, and a sense of strategic direction to planning.
The first way to do this is to simplify the planning system.
At the moment, and you will all know this better than I, there are too many plans. The hierarchy of plans is complex, often overlapping and often contradictory.
Structure plans, local plans and unitary development plans are too often incomplete or unresponsive to local needs and aspirations.
That is why structure plans, local plans and unitary development plans will be replaced by the single, new local development framework.
I know that a number of you in the Counties have expressed concerns about our proposals to abolish Structure Plans.
Let me make clear that there is no hidden agenda to abolish counties.
My concern is simply and solely with the inherent inefficiencies and barriers created by an over-bureaucratic system. There are simply too many tiers of planning and one has to go.
Increasingly Structure Plans fail to add value. Strategic issues are best settled at the regional level.
More detailed planning, on the other hand, is best undertaken at a local level where the local community can most effectively be involved.
We therefore propose that in County areas there should be the same, more straightforward, two tier system of regional and district planning as already exists for the 40% of the population that lives in unitary areas.
The Green Paper envisages that county planners will still retain minerals and waste responsibilities.
And there may be a role for them in continuing to support regional and, where appropriate, sub-regional planning as well as local development planning.
I have specifically asked in the Green Paper about what the county role should be and I invite your comments on this.
In addition to tackling the number of layers, we also need to simplify the relationship between the three levels of the system – national, regional and local.
The local development framework will be updated regularly to ensure it fits in with regional and national policy, which turn needs to be clearer, more focussed, and more accessible.
We are starting on the process of recasting guidance and will introduce a series of planning policy statements that will gradually replace the current PPGs.
Our intention is to be much more rigorous about separating out policy – things planning must deliver – from guidance about how to do it.
So, simplification and accessibility is the first principle.
The second way in which we can empower local authorities is to involve fully the people who use and are affected by planning decisions.
This includes both the business and local residential communities.
At the moment, the planning system disenfranchises rather than engages. Excludes rather than embraces.
The very people most affected by planning decisions often don’t understand how and why decisions are taken. Planning is seen as at best obscure and at worst a fundamental threat to quality of life.
What we are enduring is the bitter fruit of an adversarial system.
I want to create a new system whereby there can be real participation by the community – participation not consultation – especially in detailed planning for action areas.
There are already many example of planners taking community involvement seriously and engaging people in planning the future of their communities.
But there is tremendous scope for local authorities to use more modern and interesting ways to contact residents about planning issues, such as through the internet, or local radio, local TV – all means of reaching people and engaging them. Redcar and Cleveland, for example, has already used virtual reality to demonstrate choices for local development.
Under our new approach, local communities will be involved in the preparation of action plans for their neighbourhoods. They will help shape the vision, the objectives and the strategy.
With regard to development control, we will encourage pre-application discussions between developers and communities.
And we have proposed that, in the case of major developments, the effectiveness of community involvement could be a material consideration to be taken into account in determining a planning application.
Our vision is that local authorities will be empowered to provide a simpler system in which more people are able, and want, to get involved.
Simplicity and community involvement by necessity go together.
But this will mean little unless we focus on outcomes and the planning system delivers real improvements on the ground.
The first main issue of delivery is to create more sustainable communities.
We want our towns and cities to be attractive places in which people actively choose to live and work. We want to turn around the poverty which blights so many urban and rural areas. We want to safeguard our countryside and environment from inappropriate development and make the most efficient and appropriate use of land.
Planning must be a bridge to economic development not a barrier. The Green Paper puts these principles into practice.
For example, some types of business the need for planning consent will be completely removed. Our new business planning zones will allow high tech companies to bring forward high quality development, within defined parameters.
We have also published a consultation document on compulsory purchase which we hope will help remove a further barrier to regeneration.
The second aspect to delivery of outcomes is to ensure that planning connects with other local government functions.
In particular, local authorities must seize the opportunity of aligning their Community Strategies, regeneration or conservation strategies with their planning framework.
I very much hope that you will see planning as a valuable and powerful tool to making the aspirations set out in Community Strategies turn into action on the ground.
And the third aspect of delivery is to create a better quality of service to applicants.
The current target that 80 per cent of applications should be processed in eight weeks means that more complex – usually business – applications sometimes find themselves at the bottom of the pile as councils strain to meet the 80 per cent target.
It cannot be right, for example, that plans for the multi-million pound transformation of a city centre should take their place in a queue behind applications for domestic conservatories and dormer windows.
Our new targets – for example, sixty per cent of all major commercial applications in 13 weeks – seem longer. In fact, we believe they will speed up the system and will reinforce a sense of strategic direction in development control.
And lastly, delivery cannot pause for a break. We need to continue the momentum of change in order to deliver the improvements which are urgently needed.
Some of you may by now have seen an open letter that I sent to Cllr Keith House.
In that I have made the point that it is not acceptable for local authorities to down tools as far as updating current plans is concerned and to wait for the new regime to be introduced.
We have – obviously – to maintain a working planning system and seek to improve its delivery while we seek the legislative opportunity to change the system.
But I think we can take a constructive approach that takes full advantage of an interim position.
For example, there is no current provision that prevents an area based approach to the updating and review of plans.
There is already scope for supplementary planning guidance to be produced for action areas or areas of conservation.
There is already scope for counties to plan jointly with other authorities if they feel that cross-boundary working on sub-regional issues would be useful.
The Planning Green Paper outlines how we can move ahead to a fairer, faster and more transparent planning system, but local government can seize the opportunity to embrace change now.
The consultation period on this green paper ends in March so it’s vital you have your say before then.
In the meantime, I look forward to local government playing a key role in a reinvigorated planning system.
Good planning can make a major difference to the success of our economy, our communities and our environment. This country needs a faster, fairer and more foreseeable planning system and with your help we intend to deliver.
"
Jo Johnson,"The Office for Students came into being on 1 January and will be operational from April. It will put quality of teaching, student choice and value for money at the heart of what it does. It will be helped in that regard by a remarkably broad and strong board bringing together a wide range of talents and backgrounds, including vice-chancellors, graduate employers and legal and regulatory experts, as well as a student representative mandated by statute. The board also brings a diversity of views: its excellent chair, Sir Michael Barber, was a senior adviser to a former Labour Prime Minister; and several of its members have declared themselves to be past or present members of the Labour party. This is clearly not a body of Conservative stooges, but one that draws on talent wherever it can be found.
The Opposition have called this debate to discuss one of the board’s 15 members, Toby Young. They would have us believe that he is not qualified or suitable to be on the board. Yes, Mr Young is not a university insider, but a board made up only of university insiders would be hard pressed to provide the scrutiny and challenge to the sector that students and taxpayers deserve. Indeed, the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the desirability of the board’s members having, between them, far wider experience, including experience of promoting choice for consumers and encouraging competition. Mr Young has real experience of both as the founder of the West London Free School, and now as director of the New Schools Network, helping parents around the country to set up schools of their own. That experience will be important to a new regulator that will be charged with creating a level playing field for high-quality new providers to offer degrees alongside established universities.
At the West London Free School, which Mr Young set up, 38.5% of children receive the pupil premium, and they have done better than the national average for those on the pupil premium this year and last. A parent-governor at the school described him this week as being
“committed to public education, academic excellence, and greater opportunities for kids from lower incomes”.
He has won praise for supporting diversity by making the school a safe and supportive place for LGBT+ students. He is also an eloquent advocate of free speech, a value that is intrinsic to successful universities and which the OFS has undertaken to uphold. He has served with credit on the board of the US-UK Fulbright Commission, where he has been a strong supporter of the commission’s work with the Sutton Trust to help disadvantaged young people to attend US universities. Indeed, the chair of the Fulbright Commission, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, described Mr Young as an effective, committed and energetic commissioner, saying that he had seen no evidence that any of Mr Young’s remarks had influenced him in despatching his duties as a commissioner.​
The hon. These were foolish and wrong, and do not reflect the values of the Government, but I am not aware that anything Toby Young has said in the past has been found to have breached our strong discrimination laws, which are among the toughest in the world. In future, of course, he will be bound to comply with the Equality Act 2010 when performing all his functions for the Office for Students. Regardless of the legal position, it is of course right that Mr Young has apologised unreservedly to the OFS board. It is also right that he has said that he regrets the comments and given an undertaking that the kind of remarks he made in the past will not be repeated. So be in no doubt that if he or any board member were to make these kinds of inappropriate comments in the future, they would be dismissed.
As the Prime Minister said yesterday, since these comments and tweets, Mr Young has been doing “exceedingly good work” in our education system, and it is for that reason that he is well placed to make a valuable contribution to the work of the board of the Office for Students, where he will continue to do much more to support the disadvantaged than so many of his armchair critics.

Donald Trump,"Thank you. My fellow Americans, we are joined together today in sadness, shock, and grief. Last night, a gunman opened fire on a large crowd at a country music concert in Las Vegas Nevada. He brutally murdered more than 50 people, and wounded hundreds more
It was an act of pure evil. The FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security are working closely with local authorities to assist with the investigation, and they will provide updates as to the investigation and how it develops.
I want to thank the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and all of the first responders for their courageous efforts and for helping to save the lives of so many. The speed with which they acted is miraculous and prevented further loss of life.
To have found the shooter so quickly after the first shots were fired, is something for which we will always be thankful and grateful. It shows what true professionalism is all about.
Hundreds of our fellow citizens are now mourning the sudden loss of a loved one: a parent, a child, a brother or sister. We cannot fathom their pain, we cannot imagine their loss. To the families of the victims, we are praying for you, and we are here for you, and we ask God to help see you through this very dark period.
Scripture teaches us the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. We seek comfort in those words, for we know that God lives in the hearts of those who grieve. To the wounded who are now recovering in hospitals, we are praying for your full and speedy recovery, and pledge to you our support from this day forward.
In memory of the fallen, I have directed that our great flag be flown at half staff. I will be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement, first responders and the families of the victims.
In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one and it always has. We call upon the bonds that unite us: our faith, our family, and our shared values. We call upon the bonds of citizenship, the ties of community and the comfort of our common humanity.
Our unity cannot be shattered by evil. Our bonds can not be broken by violence, and though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today -- and always will, forever.
In times such as these, I know we are searching for some kind of meaning in the chaos, some kind of light in the darkness. The answers do not come easy. But we can take solace knowing that even the darkest space can be brightened by a single light, and even the most terrible despair can be illuminated by a single ray of hope.
Melania and I are praying for every American who has been hurt, wounded, or lost the ones they loved so dearly in this terrible, terrible attack. We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace, and we pray for the day when evil is banished, and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear.
May God bless the souls of the lives that are lost. May God give us the grace of healing and may God provide the grieving families with the strength to carry on. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you.

Donald Trump,"If you called up somebody else that you've never even heard of who's got great wealth and said I want to do an interview, number one, they'd be afraid to do it; number two, they wouldn't want to do it; number three, they wouldn't know how to do it; and number four, they're probably right.
They're probably right.
Well, I think -- I think there's a nice safety net in not doing it. There's no reason to expose yourself to millions of people. There's no...
Why? Tell me.
Oh, I hate the publicity.
Oh, no. I'm telling you I hate the publicity.
I hate it and except for the fact that it's as fun as a sparring session, I mean, this would normally not even be fun. This is -- this is fine and this is fun and all that stuff, but ...
No, you don't understand.
You have to understand. It happens to be -- it happens to be -- well, both. It happens to be good for what I do.
That is really incredible. There's nothing like it. There's nothing like this place.
I sell very great condominiums in New York. I have the best ...
What, the Trump Tower?
What is the normal spiel? I don't ...
I don't know if it was by my own design.
I do developments which get a lot of publicity. I mean, if I didn't do Trump ...
I mean this. If Trump Tower weren't a great building on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street by a young guy ...
Trump Towers was built by a young guy in a very important ...
No, I don't think it was by design, though. I think that it happened, but I don't ...
No. I want to be innocent. I've always wanted to be innocent. My entire life has been devoted to being innocent.
But I don't know that it is by design. Did I once call you and say, Connie, we have to do an interview? We have to do this. It's great. It's going to be the greatest thing ...
Absolutely.
I think generally speaking, family. I think that -- I think it's very important -- stability. I'd like to say continued economic success. You would always say the most important thing would be health for yourself and the people around you and the people that you love because that's -- that's ultimately the most important I think.
Well, I have so many different friends and it would be hard to say a best friend.
She's -- she's a great friend, she's -- I have a father who's a great friend.
I -- I tend not to confide. I really tend not to confide. I'm very closed in that sense now. I think that's my own maybe guarded mechanism.
I don't trust people. I'm -- I'm a non-trusting person. I trust members of my family, I trust people that are very close to me.
Oh, I agree. Going into business with family members is either the best or the worst. There's no in-between.
Robert does a great job and Ivana runs the Plaza Hotel and she's doing a beautiful job.
No. No. I -- I generally think it's not a good policy but ...
... I also think -- it works in my family and I also think it's a great policy if it does work, but if for some reason it doesn't work out, there could be nothing worse.
I don't. You never do.
I've seen people confide in the wrong people and it's really devastating. And, again, I don't say that as a positive ...
No, I think it stems from the fact that I had a brother who -- who was an extraordinary guy. He was a -- an -- an absolutely brilliant personality. He was handsome, he was wonderful, people loved him, he was nice, he confided in everybody. He was truly a nice human being and people took advantage of him and I saw what they did to my brother and I didn't like it.
He totally did. He totally gave of himself and he gave himself to other people.
He totally did and I tend to be just the opposite.
There's something very beautiful about it. Unfortunately, when you're growing up in New York City and you're dealing with some of the great sharks of the world, especially in the real estate business, it's not very good. It was very bad in a business sense. He was -- he was taken advantage of.
He didn't want to. You're absolutely right. He didn't want to. He should not have, and perhaps it was my fault and perhaps my father's fault for egging him on to business because he wasn't good at it, because he didn't like the business ...
I did. I don't like to think too much about what happened with Fred. With Fred, it was an alcohol problem and it ultimately -- all of what I'm saying led to alcoholism and that indirectly just killed him. Fred used to tell me when I was very young, don't ever smoke -- don't ever smoke, don't ever drink. See, he had these problems. He knew what the problems were. He couldn't solve them for himself, but he tried to solve them for me.
I think I'm relatively happy. I'm content certainly. I'm not a man who walks around smiling and telling everybody I'm happy. I'm happy. Here I am. But I'm a pretty content guy.
I really don't like to think about what's missing, you know? If you get into what's missing, you don't appreciate what you have and you can also say ...
I'm always looking for more excitement in life. I look at life as one time -- here we are, it's a one-time go around. I'm always looking for more excitement. Oftentimes, I would not consider my life to be the most exciting time in the world and probably the world would tell me I'm crazy because I think the world's perception of me and my life is much different than that.
No, it's not meeting someone. It's doing something. It's achieving something. It's -- it's the thrill of doing -- when I buy the Plaza Hotel, to me that's exciting because it's a trophy. It's a total trophy. When I build Trump Tower or when I build the Taj Mahal ...
Yeah, but it's exciting, and part of the reason it's exciting is because they're megadeals, they're important deals, they're glamorous deals. Everybody talks about them, everybody reads about them and writes about them. There's a level of importance there that I think also somewhat turns me on
Well, you can say that, but in actuality thousands and thousands of people are put to work. Millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes are paid and that ...
But, Connie, all of that money ...
I know. I know and I've also done non-luxury. I've done a lot of low-income housing, I've done a lot of senior citizens ...
Oh, you've -- you've read -- you've read my past.
But the truth is whether I build a Trump Tower or whether I build senior citizen housing -- I think Trump Tower in many respects is -- and I'm very proud of the senior citizen housing I built.
Doesn't matter. I mean, it doesn't matter. Now, Connie ...
I hope so.
So, what are you asking me?
So, let me ask you -- I do a book and I get millions of dollars from the book. The book turned out to be like the biggest book of the year and I give all of that money to charity. I do a game, I do a game show, I do the Wallman's skating rink where the city incompetently for seven years can't open the rink.
That's a very important thing. It's a part of society.
It's an important thing, you know. Sure, it's a skating rink, but in the meantime, you'd have half of New York City going crazy because they didn't have their little skating rink.
I feel very philanthropic. I really do.
And I'm a young guy ...
Oh, I think people believe that. See, it gets to a point where some people can never be satisfied, Connie. Perhaps you're one of those people.
Why did I buy it? Because it would have driven me crazy if anyone else owned it.
Because I'm looking at it every day. How would I feel if someone else owned it? Wouldn't that be a horrible feeling? You come to your office, you're looking at the most beautiful building that I've ever seen, the Plaza Hotel, and somebody else owns it. I'd feel guilty, so I had to buy it.
Well, it's a different mind-set.
No, I guess not
I try to spend as much time with them as possible and I think that's important and I think they see and I think they also understand that my life is different than my -- and they're at an age now where they understand it. But I really spend as much time as you can spend under the circumstances in which I live.
Absolutely. I have to.
If my son calls me, as an example, I'll always take his call no matter what I'm doing. I mean, I'll always take his call. I always feel that it's very important to be really close with each other. The children are special.
Donald Jr. Any -- any one of my children. If any one of my children
If any one of my children call, I'll always take their call no matter what I'm doing.
Right.
Well, I don't have a choice. I mean it's a family that's -- it's a good family, it's a good life. I think when Ivana -- I often say looks at Mar-a-Lago.
My daughter -- and she walks into the halls of Mar-a-Lago which is a home in Palm Beach that I bought in all fairness as an investment, but I. . .
Yeah. And -- and when she looks at its magnificence, you see this little girl and she looks up and she says -- you know, and -- and I just wonder what she must be thinking because it can't be a normal situation, but I think maybe it's as normal as it's going to get. I think she takes it for granted perhaps and maybe it's good or maybe that's not good, but to her it's a normal situation.
I don't know. I'll tell you about it in 20 years after they grow up. I can't tell you now.
Well, I don't know what ostentatious means. I mean, the Mar-a-Lago is considered architecturally one of the great places of this continent.
The yacht is considered -- but -- but let me tell you, I don't do it for that reason. I do it as an investment. I mean, I buy the yacht ..
Well, I -- no, because I don't think it has an effect. I think -- I think the effect on the children is seeing good parents, seeing this or seeing that. I don't think the effect on the children is whether they go into a big yacht or a small yacht or regular boat ...
... or something else, or whether it's a big house or a small house. I think that's not -- I mean, there are very many unhappy children that have a one-bedroom apartment -- that live in a one-bedroom apartment with their parents and . . .
No, I understand, but I do it as an investment.
Sure they go on it, but very seldom. I do it as an investment. I don't need necessarily to live like this. I could be very happy living in a one-bedroom apartment believe me.
I might try it. I mean maybe -- maybe one of these days we'll give it a shot.
I think I've gone through my midlife crisis. I -- I really feel good about the way things are in life.
I don't think -- I don't think it's been a dramatic period for me. You know, I think men do have a midlife crisis. I don't think from my standpoint it's been a particularly dramatic period.
Maybe I haven't been there yet. I'm not sure that I'm really at midlife yet. I hope I'm not. So maybe I haven't been there yet. I'll make you a deal. If I do go through a midlife crisis, I'll call you and let you know. It will be very exciting.
"
Theresa May,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on last week’s European Council.
Before the Council, I wrote to President Tusk to seek formal approval for the legally-binding assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop and Alternative Arrangements agreed in Strasbourg on 11th March. I reported your Statement, Mr Speaker, which made clear that for a further Meaningful Vote to take place, the deal would have to be “fundamentally different – not different in terms of wording, but different in terms of substance.”
I explained that, as a result, some Honourable and Right Honourable Members were seeking further changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.
And I requested a short extension to the Article 50 process to 30th June. I regret having to do so. I wanted to deliver Brexit on 29th March. But I am conscious of my duties as Prime Minister to all parts of our United Kingdom and of the damage to that Union leaving without a deal could do when one part of it is without devolved government and unable therefore to prepare properly.
The Council formally endorsed the legal Instrument relating to the Withdrawal Agreement and the Joint Statement supplementing the Political Declaration.
This should increase the confidence of the House that the backstop is unlikely ever to be used, and would only be temporary if it is.
But the Council also reiterated, once again, its longstanding position that there could be no reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement.
So however the House decides to proceed this week, everyone should be absolutely clear that changing the Withdrawal Agreement is simply not an option.
Turning to extending Article 50, this has always required the unanimous agreement of the other 27 Member States.
As I have made clear before, it was never guaranteed that the EU would agree to an extension – or the terms on which we requested it.
And they did not.
Instead the Council agreed that if the House approves the Withdrawal Agreement this week, our departure will be extended to 11pm on 22nd May.
This will allow time for Parliament to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which is legally necessary for the deal to be ratified.
But if the House does not approve the Withdrawal Agreement this week, our departure will instead be extended only to 11pm on 12th April.
At this point we would either leave with No Deal, or we would “indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the European Council”.
If this involved a further extension, it would certainly mean participation in the European Parliamentary elections.
The Council’s Conclusions were subsequently turned into a legal Decision, with which the UK agreed, and which came into force last Friday.
So while the Government has today laid a Statutory Instrument, which will be debated later this week, to reflect this in our own domestic legislation, the date for our departure from the EU has now changed in international law.
Were the House not to pass the Statutory Instrument, it would cause legal confusion and damaging uncertainty, but it would not have any effect on the date of our exit.
Mr Speaker, I continue to believe that the right path forward is for the United Kingdom to leave the EU as soon as possible with a deal, now on 22nd May.
But it is with great regret that I have had to conclude that as things stand, there is still not sufficient support in the House to bring back the deal for a third Meaningful Vote.
I continue to have discussions with colleagues across the House to build support, so that we can bring the vote forward this week, and guarantee Brexit.
If we cannot, the Government made a commitment that we would work across the House to find a majority on a way forward.
The amendment in the name of my Right Honourable Friend the Member for West Dorset seeks to provide for this process by taking control of the Order Paper. I continue to believe doing so would be an unwelcome precedent to set, which would overturn the balance of our democratic institutions.
So the Government will oppose this amendment this evening, but in order to fulfil our commitments to this House would seek to provide government time in order for this process to proceed.
It would be for this House to put forward options for consideration, and to determine the procedure by which they wished to do so.
I must confess that I am sceptical about such a process of indicative votes.
When we have tried this kind of thing in the past, it has produced contradictory outcomes or no outcome at all. There is a further risk when it comes to Brexit, as the UK is only one half of the equation and the votes could lead to an outcome that is unnegotiable with the EU.
No Government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is.
So I cannot commit the Government to delivering the outcome of any votes held by this house. But I do commit to engaging constructively with this process.
There are many different views on the way forward, but I want to explain the options as I understand them.
The default outcome continues to be to leave with No Deal.
But this house has previously expressed its opposition to that path, and may very well do so again this week.
The alternative is to pursue a different form of Brexit or a Second Referendum.
But the bottom line remains, if the House does not approve the Withdrawal Agreement this week, and is not prepared to countenance leaving without a deal we will have to seek a longer extension. This would entail the UK having to hold European Elections. And it would mean that we will not have been able to guarantee Brexit.
These are now choices the House will have the opportunity to express its view on.
Mr Speaker, this is the first chance I have had to address the House since my remarks last Wednesday evening.
I expressed my frustration with our collective failure to take a decision, but I know that many Members across this House are frustrated too.
We all have difficult jobs to do.
People on all sides of the debate hold passionate views and I respect those differences.
I would also like to thank all of those colleagues that have supported the deal so far, and those that have taken the time to meet with me to discuss their concerns.
I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision.
And in doing so we must confront the reality of the hard choices before us.
Unless this House agrees to it, No Deal will not happen.
No Brexit must not happen.
And a slow Brexit which extends Article 50 beyond 22nd May, forces the British people to take part in European Elections and gives up control of any of our borders, laws, money or trade is not a Brexit that will bring the British people together.
I know that the Deal I have put forward is a compromise. It seeks to deliver on the referendum and retain trust in our democracy, while also respecting the concerns of those who voted to remain.
But if this House can back it, we could be out of the European Union in less than two months.
There would no further extensions, no threat to Brexit and no risk of a No Deal.
That I believe is the way to deliver the Brexit the British people voted for.
And I commend this Statement to the House.
"
John Hutton,"It’s a tremendous honour to have been asked to present this year’s Nursing Standard Awards. I’m absolutely delighted to be here this evening.
For over 150 years, nursing has been a profession with high standards, a clear ethos and a strong sense of public service. It’s not surprising therefore that nurses are amongst the most respected of all of our caring professions. Respected just as much for the care you provide to the sick and to the injured as for your compassion and humanity, often in the face of personal tragedy and distress. There will be very few people in this room tonight, in our country, whose lives haven’t been touched by the comfort and reassurance that nurses provide, every hour of the day, every day of the year.
It is an extraordinary job that you do.
And the role of nursing is central to the delivery of high quality care to patients. So our national health service must always look to strengthen this role and help make nursing an attractive and rewarding career. As part of this process we need to highlight the achievement and contribution that nurses make to the work of the NHS and to work with the profession in planning for the future – for what lies ahead of the profession. Because it’s the future of nursing as a profession, not what might have happened to it in the past, that is probably at the forefront of all of our minds this evening.
And I do believe that the future for the profession is a hugely bright one. Of course we haven’t solved every problem. There are still too few nurses working in the NHS and the pressure this generates is experienced every day by nurses and patients up and down the country – we all know this. And we do need to do more to break through the artificial demarcations that still limit the contributions that nurses can make. In our hospitals and in primary care too. I accept that.
But neither is it true that no progress has been made in any of these areas. There are more nurses than ever before working in the NHS – both full time and part time and we are able to do more in ensuring access to decent childcare support.
We are succeeding in attracting more of those who have left the profession to come back to nursing.
There are more nurses in training than ever before.
We have hundreds of nurse consultants running their own clinics and treating their own patients. Not enough, but a good start.
Thousands of nurses are now able to prescribe drugs – a task which in the past, had always been the exclusive preserve of doctors.
And nurses are delivering care in over 50 NHS walk in Centres and in NHS Direct.
And in primary care, nurses are now employing doctors. We have come a very long way indeed. But there is more still to do.
But I believe, and I hope people in this room do too, that if we are going to lay the foundations for a successful future for the profession we have to get the basics right.
Agenda for Change, negotiated by all of the NHS trade unions and supported by the RCN is a huge step forward for nursing. No more artificial barriers to how far a nurse can progress. Nurse consultants earning the equivalent of senior doctors. Parity between nurses and teachers in terms of career salaries. And a proper acceptance that if a nurse takes on new roles and responsibilities then he or she will be properly rewarded for doing so. We will continue to work closely with the RCN on making Agenda for Change the beginning of a new deal for nurses. For Agenda for Change to succeed partnership at every level is going to be essential. The RCN had asked for more resources to help meet the backfill costs of staff representatives who are helping to implement Agenda for Change. Last month, I was pleased to do just that – an extra £30 million to help Trusts meet these additional costs. So I am grateful to the RCN for the leadership it is showing.
But it’s not just nurses who will benefit from these reforms. Patients will benefit too. Agenda for Change will help us recruit more nurses into the profession. It will help us to retain them for longer as well, and so improving the continuity of care to patients. Helping the NHS to become the service we all want it to be.
We need to do more I accept to reduce the drop out rate from nurse training courses and also to improve the career prospects for nurse educators in college. Attrition rates of 15% are simply not good enough. We need to reward those colleges that do more to keep attrition rates as low as possible. And we need to look carefully at whether we are providing the right financial support to student nurses because ensuring that nursing remains a popular career choice for young people is absolutely essential for the future success of the profession as a whole.
In all of these areas we want to work constructively with the profession. We want to make more progress in all of those areas where we know there is still more work to be done. And we would like to do this, as I said, in a partnership with nurses themselves so that the advances we are able to make are sustainable and that we focus on the right priorities. And we will always listen with respect to the profession because no one understands better than nurses themselves what isn’t right and what isn’t working.
So you can help us to get it right.
But tonight we are also focusing on what we know is already right about nursing.
We are here to celebrate the achievements of some truly outstanding nurses. Nurses from all over the country whose professionalism and service to others has been rightly identified as being of the highest possible professional standard.
You have done an absolutely brilliant job. I want to congratulate each of you for winning these very special awards tonight. The decision to make these awards has been made by other nurses. I don’t think there can be any higher praise than that.
We can now move on to the award ceremony itself. Thank you for listening. And thank you once again for everything you do for the NHS and its patients.
"
Denis Healey,"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement on the Government’s policy for winning the battle against inflation.
The policy I announced on 15th July last year comes to an end in 10 days’ ​ time. It has been an impressive success. Inflation has been reduced to 7·4 per cent, well under half the rate a year ago, the lowest inflation rate for six years and far lower than that which the present Government inherited in March 1974. In fact, Britain’s inflation rate is now about the average for industrial countries—about the same as that of the United States, lower than that of France and Canada, although still higher than that of Germany and Japan.
The standard of living has not simply been maintained, as I then promised. It has risen by some 5 per cent. for most men and women in Britain during the current pay round, partly as a result of the tax cuts and improvements in social benefits which the falling rate of inflation has enabled the Government to make. Some of these tax cuts and increases in benefit have still to take effect. In particular, retirement pensions will be worth £31·20 for a married couple in November—an increase of almost 20 per cent. in real terms compared with the level we inherited four and a half years ago, and the child benefit will amount to £4 a week for every child when the increase next April is added to that in November. As a result of all the fiscal changes since last October and taking account of child benefit changes, a family on £75 a week with two children, will have an increase in net income of some 12 per cent. by next April—equivalent to a wage increase of about 15·5 per cent.
The fall in our inflation rate has also made possible a substantial increase in national growth. Industrial output was rising at an annual rate of well over 4 per cent. in the last three months. Unemployment has been on a falling trend since September last year.
The nation owes a debt to trade unionists and employers alike for the common sense they have shown in observing the Government’s guidelines in the last 12 months.
Inflation will remain around 8 per cent. for the rest of this year at least. We must now ensure that it does not rise into double figures again next year. This means that earnings must increase substantially less in the coming pay round than in the current round.
Our aim should be to keep the increase next year to half what it has been this ​ year. The climate for pay negotiation is now very much more favourable to moderate settlements than it was a year ago. Nevertheless, the Government cannot rely on this alone. They must give a clear lead: they must accept the responsibility for fixing guidelines which will enable us to keep inflation in single figures. The White Paper to be published today therefore sets a guideline for pay settlements for the coming round at 5 per cent.—half the level of the guideline in the current round.
The White Paper sets out some limited exceptions to this guideline. The form of the guideline offers negotiators the same flexibility as they have had in the current round to structure their settlements in the way best suited to their particular circumstances. I hope employers and unions will use this flexibility according to their needs—in particular, to restore differentials where appropriate.
In a small number of cases in the public sector the Government have already recognised that some exceptional increase is required. The increase in national earnings resulting from these exceptions is expected to be only about 0·15 per cent. in each of the next two years. There may be a small number of other groups for whom similar treatment might be appropriate when they reach their settlement date. But it would be self-defeating if more than a few groups were accorded such treatment and the Government will therefore carefully examine any proposals put forward in this area to see how far the same considerations apply.
To help those on the lowest incomes, the Government would be ready to see higher percentage increases where the resulting earnings were no more than £44·50 for a normal full-time week, which is the present-day equivalent of the minimum pay target set by the TUC four years ago plus the 5 per cent. The Government expect those on higher earnings in the same or other industries to accept the relative improvement in the position of the lowest paid which follows.
The Government will expect negotiators, as in the current year, to respect their existing annual settlement date. In the very exceptional case which may arise where a highly fragmented bargaining situation needs to be rationalised, the Government will be prepared to consider synchronising settlement dates providing ​ that the overall level of the settlement takes account of any costs involved.
Self-financing productivity deals will be permitted on the same conditions as in the current round.
Much attention has been focused on the possibility of reducing working hours and the contribution this might make to increasing job opportunities. We welcome the recent TUC initiative on the reduction of overtime working. However, if a reduction in hours led to an increase in labour costs the result could only be to reduce employment. In general, therefore, the Government could accept a reduction in hours as part of a pay settlement only on condition that the settlement as a whole does not lead to any increase in unit costs above what would have resulted from a straight guideline settlement on pay.
As in the current round, the Government will do everything possible to ensure that the guidance set out in the White Paper is observed throughout the public sector. In the private sector the Government rely on employers and unions to act with responsibility and moderation as the CBI and TUC have assured us they will. However, the Government will, if necessary, take account of any failure to observe the guidelines in exercising their discretion in the fields of statutory assistance and other appropriate discretionary powers. The pay clauses in existing Government contracts will remain in force and will continue to be included in new contracts. The Government will, of course, as promised in March, be ready to hold discussions with the CBI about the operation of these arrangements for the future.
The Government regard continuing price control as an important part of the battle against inflation. Over the coming months the Price Commission will maintain an active programme of investigations into individual companies and will also examine, at the direction of the Government, pricing practices in different sectors of industry. The Commission not only has a duty to identify excessive price increases and to recommend the steps needed to correct them, but in doing so to take full account of the wider economic background against which such price increases are put forward.
The present statutory powers to control dividends expire on 31st July 1978. The ​ Government will introduce a Bill to extend the statutory control for a further 12 months from 1st August 1978 on the present basis, with the present provisions for exceptions and one new provision. From 1st August 1978 no company will be required by the controls to increase its dividend cover above the highest level achieved since the current controls began. This will enable companies to increase their dividends in line with profits or in line with the statutory limit, whichever is the higher, but they will not be permitted to distribute funds accumulated in the past. A separate announcement giving details of this provision will be made.
The Government are convinced that the British people will not throw away the gains they have made over the last three years in the battle against inflation. The guidelines laid down in the White Paper offer negotiators the opportunity to use their freedom in collective bargaining to reach settlements with responsibility and moderation. By doing so they will encourage the regeneration of British industry, maintain living standards and make possible a continuing fall in unemployment.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much.
Well I think it could very well be. Come to think of it.
That's good. That's good.
I don't think so. I mean we're -- we're winning everywhere that we see. And we see a lot of fake polls put out by people that put the same polls out four years ago. I think that when you look at the enthusiasm in Orlando last night, you look at Florida, you look at what's going on. We had at least 20,000 in that arena last night.
And we sent away thousands and thousands. We had 120,000 requests. No, I think we're doing great. I think we're doing really well in Florida and Ohio. Pennsylvania, I think we're doing very well. I won Pennsylvania last time, first one to win as a Republican in many years. And we brought back a lot of business.
Pennsylvania's having the best year they've ever had as a state. Michigan's having the best year they've ever had as a state. I don't know, I mean, I should do well.
When you say that, you mean illegal immigrants?
Because I've been very good to immigrants, but illegal immigrants.
Right.
Right. And you know many of them are from China many, of them from other parts of the world that you wouldn't even believe. And our laws are so bad. Congress has done nothing about our laws and fixing our immigration laws. They're so bad. The asylum laws are laughed at by everybody in the world that knows anything about it.
Go ahead.
And you know my poll numbers with Hispanics? Went up 17 points.
Well OK explain that. I've been tough.
And yet my poll numbers with Hispanics have gone way up.
Right now it's 50 percent.
I know but for a Republican, I'm at 50 percent. I went up 70 points. You know why? The Hispanics --
Well, we'll show it to you.
We'll show it to you.
No, no, we'll show it to you. But let me do it. We went up 17 points, you saw that. I went up 17 points because I'm tough at the border. Because the Hispanics want toughness at the border. They don't want people coming and taking their jobs. They don't want criminals to come because they understand the border better than anybody.
It's not a mistake. We want to have strong borders. It's not a mistake. But let me just explain something --
No, no, let me explain.
Now, when I became president, President Obama had a separation policy. I didn't have it, he had it. I brought the families together. I'm the one that put them together. Now, I said something when I did that. Watch. Many more people will come up and that's what happened. But President Obama is the one that built those prisons cells.
Ready? Are you ready? Under the Obama plan --
No we're not. Because I'm the one that put people together. They separated, I put them together.
Excuse me. Because I put em together.
That's because I put them together. Under Obama, you had separation --
No, I put them together. I'm the one that changed the plan. I inherited separation and I changed the plan and I brought people together. Now when I did that I said watch what happens. More people are going to come up because when you put the parents together with the children when you don't separate. And that's exactly what happened.
But I hated to have the separation policy and the prisoners that you saw they called them --
Well it was zero tolerance means to me is going to be tough on the border.
No, no, no. I put them together. Just remember that, I put them together.
Yeah. Ready?
The Democrats don't want to make a deal. It's not an executive order, you know, where the Supreme Court right now would be going to be before the United States Supreme Court, sir. And the judges, the justices are going to make a decision. I would have made a decision earlier than that. I can't get Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer to do anything for the dreamers.
They will do nothing for the dreamers. They don't care about the dreamers.
Let me tell you what I did. I revoked it because everybody said that Obama had no right to do it. But I didn't revoke it quickly. I said let's make a deal. They were unable to make a deal. So now, it's sitting before the United States Supreme Court. I am willing to do something with the dreamers as you call DACA.
By the way, there are different meanings when you say dreamers and DACA there were really a different -- but let's for purposes of this let's call it the same thing call them the dreamers. But that's very much different than DACA. Are you ready? I am willing to make a deal. I always happen. But Pelosi and Schumer don't want to make a deal.
They don't want to make a deal.
We are doing something --
And their time came up and now somebody has to make a decision as to whether or not they're going to stay in the country. And I haven't made that decision yet. But we're going to take a look at it. By the way,, somebody has to make that decision. You know, they're supposed to leave --
I love immigrants. I love immigrants. This country is based on immigrants. Our country is based on immigrants and without it -- In fact I'll tell you, I want people to come in. I have brought so much industry into the country. We have 17 car plants under construction, we have Foxconn coming in to Wisconsin.
We have all these massive companies. You know we're doing incredibly well, 3.5 percent unemployment. By the way, lowest Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. Lowest Asian, lowest African-American also. But we have the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. Hispanics today are --have the average net wealth, the wealthiest they've ever been under Trump not under Obama because under Obama they were going the wrong way.
Well this week I consider them a friend. They've been doing a great job, actually. They -- we signed an agreement last week. They have 6,000 people going to their southern border troops and they are doing a really good job. I mean, so far, they've been doing a real good job.
Look, they can easily stop if they want to. They can easily stop this tremendous migration to the United States and then we have all these -- the illegals coming in. It's no good. Mexico has been great for the last week and a half. Now, I signed the agreement a week and a half ago but they've been great.
They've honored the agreement. They would -- if they weren't great, I would put tariffs on.
Yeah, I would. I like him. I do. I like him
I don't think I won it. No, no. Mexico didn't need millions of people pouring through the middle of their country. OK. I think we both won.
Maybe it's different but they have very strong immigration lawyers, we don't. They will stop them and they can stop them before they ever get to the border.
So far it looks like it is Mexico's doing a great job for Mexico and for the United States. So far, but it's only a week and a half.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not the U.S. airway, to do Mexico's work. People shouldn't be allowed to walk through Mexico into our country. They're not supposed to be in Mexico either. So Mexico is removing those people and they're bringing them back to Honduras and different places Guatemala, El Salvador. They're bringing them back.
And so far they've been doing great. And that's why I'm not doing tariffs, otherwise I would do tariffs, and I don't want to do tariffs to Mexico but it would be tremendously costly for me. I don't even know if would be affordable for Mexico.
Right.
Right.
Maybe I'll do that.
I really -- you know, I've been asked that question, honestly, you never know, you never know. I could comment on different ones but I won't bother too much. I think it's a little bit -- Bernie. Bernie looks like he's had it. Bernie looks crazy but he always did. But it looks like a tired crazy right now and Joe Biden, he looks like he's just exhausted.
I don't know what happened to him but he is exhausted and he doesn't do any work. He's not working. One thing I found out about this job to do it right and I've done it right. You have to work hard. No president in two and a half years has ever done what we've done in terms of tax cuts, in terms of regulation in terms of Second Amendment, in terms of so many different things.
There's never been anything like it and that's OK. You know what we've done with the vets with choice. They couldn't get choice. They couldn't get accountability and we've got these things passed that have been passed for 45 years.
I know but Buttigieg, you do believe that? Really? Do you believe it? They also had me losing Texas to Pocahontas. I'm not losing Texas to anybody. We have a tremendous lead in Texas. We have a tremendous lead in Florida. Quinnipiac, I don't respect that poll. They've been calling me wrong for a long time.
I mean, they've been calling me terribly wrong and now I will say I have a good poll with Rasmussen, where I'm at 51 percent and you have to understand I'm at 51 percent. But I've been hit for two and a half years, since I became president, by the fake news and by this nonsense with the Mueller Report, where I win the Mueller report and now they want to do a do over.
You know they want to do it again. Let's do it again. It was no good didn't turn out good for them. So they said, ""Let's do it again."". But as you know, and you will admit, for two and a half years they've been doing nothing but hitting me and they still are, I'm at 51 percent and I'm winning most of the states that we poll, where we have actual real pollers.
Most of the state, not democratic inclined pollers or polls that were bad last time. You know, when I look at some of the polls from my race against crooked Hillary Clinton. OK. And I look at those polls, they were just like this, they were worse far worse. I was going to lose to her a week before the election according to the Washington Post ABC.
I was going to lose by at least 12 to 14 points and then we sent a letter of complaint and the next week they changed the poll. That was the day of the election. They changed the poll and it was like even, I said, ""How do we go from 12 to 14 points. We sent a legal letter to them and we're even and then we won the election.
Absolutely and I did well in it last time and surprisingly and I think I'm going to do much better this time.
Because I've been very tough on Cuba, I love the Cuban people from Miami and elsewhere. I've been very, very tough on Cuba. Nobody's been like me on Cuba and we're going to get Cuba worked out properly not the way Obama did it, which was a disaster, which I revoked, but we're going to get Cuba taken care of. Venezuela, who's gonna be tougher than -- than I am.
Well you said process, OK, I mean, it's a process. It's terrible Venezuela, where people are starving. This was one of the wealthiest countries and now people are starving, they have no water they have no nothing. We've been very, very tough. Some people say we've been too tough, I say we haven't been tough enough.
And I love the Venezuelan people. We're sitting in Dora, this is called Venezuela, a little Venezuela, this area. It's the best area. If a house is for sale around Doral, if it doesn't sell within a week they say there's something wrong. OK. This is a very successful area. The people of Venezuela are a great people but they've been decimated by these two characters that have been so horrible over the years.
I will. I just, as you know, I have a very good relationship in Argentina. We have a very good relationship in Colombia with the new president, who's doing, I hear, a very good job. I would like to say we're going to soon have a very good relationship with the people in Venezuela. We have to help those people, those people are starving.
They have no water. It's run by a dictator. It's a horrible thing going on and if you look at what's going on in Venezuela, it's horrible. And you know who's causing the problem? Largely, Cuba. They've got 25,000 troops, and Cuba does, and we're putting sanctions in Cuba. And I just stopped the cruise ships from going to Cuba.
And Cuba has got to straighten out and I will tell you, I don't even know politically is that good or bad, but the people in Miami, they gave me the Bay of Pigs award just before the election because they loved the job I'm doing with respect to Cuba. The Cubans gave me the Bay of Pigs, did you know that?
Well I've already created a minimum wage because wages have gone up more than anybody in many decades.
Excuse me. Wages have gone up more than 3 percent. It's more than the number. The people that I'm dealing with and the people that -- and if you look at the reports, that's a very low number, the $15. And I am actually looking at that but looking at the pie I am I am looking at that.
I am looking at that, I will say this. But beyond that, because that's just an artificial number, much more important because I'd like to get people higher than that. Wages have gone up tremendously in the United States since I've taken over. In fact, soon to be record numbers.
Go ahead.
Well a couple of appointments I would have not appointed a couple of people in my life would have been much simpler life, so I could say that but without getting personal, I'll hold that for a later date.
I know, I know, I appreciate that. I think my biggest mistakes was I put a couple of people in that I shouldn't have put it.
I have no regrets. You know, I've done a great job. I've done more than any president in the history of our country in the first two and a half years. I've gotten -- I've taken care of our vets. I've taken care of our military, we've rebuilt our military. This year will be the final year, we are rebuilding our tanks our planes, you have to see.
We had planes that didn't fly. We had planes where they had to go to the desert, they call it the graveyard to get parts. You take a look at what I've done with the Right To Try. Take a look at what I've done with Choice for the vets. Take a look at all of the things -- and accountability for the vets. Nobody's ever, ever thought it was possible to get veterans choice, that's where veterans if they have to wait can go out and see a doctor.
Well you can't do it in one word. I mean, I can give you a nice beautiful word. I can talk about -- I can say excellence, OK. Excellence and then I leave the interview. But you can't do it in one word. Look, I've worked hard, I've been battling a deep state that is disgraceful. Phony -- phony allegations and the other side is guilty, I mean, actually, when the other side is guilty and despite the whole witch hunt thing, which is now coming to an end, the Mueller report turned out really good.
Of course, they don't accept it still, you know, they want to keep going because they have nothing else to do and that's the problem the Democrats are not getting anything done in Congress, and it's very bad. They have an opportunity to do drug-price lowering. They have an opportunity to do infrastructure, so many different things.
they have an opportunity to solve the problem on the border because we wouldn't need Mexico if they do a couple of things with loopholes and with asylum. But I do respect Mexico, and I want to thank the president and everybody because it's only a week and a half but there's been a tremendous difference on the border.
Well she was fine with it. She's been a great first lady. They really like her. They really like Melania. You have to see, last night you saw that she walked out she's got a tremendous hand and the people like Melania, she's she's a very good person, she's worked very hard in the opioid problem. That's something that she really took to heart and we've knocked it down about 17 percent in a year and a half, we've knocked it down by being very tough on doctors and medical.
They want me to do it.
They do.
You're ready? They don't want to lose their jobs. They want to keep their salaries, their wages up, and they don't want crime. When people come through, you have MS-13 coming through.
But it's a lot of people
If it was one in a hundred it's still many.
I agree, but if it's one in a hundred it's too many. And we're taking them out of our country by the thousands and the Hispanics see that their communities that -- that these people these -- these horrible people MSO team and other gang members are being removed from our country.
Ready? Obama built the cages. I didn't build them. Obama built the cages, that's No. 1. Obama separated, I'm the one that did a presidential order bringing the parents together.
I don't have much time to sleep. Fortunately, I've never been a big sleeper in terms of hours but I sleep fine. I mean I sleep very good.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
"
Theresa May,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the Government’s work to secure a Withdrawal Agreement that can command the support of this House.
A fortnight ago I committed to come back before the House today if the Government had not by now secured a majority for a Withdrawal Agreement and a Political Declaration.
In the two weeks since, my Rt Hon Friends the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, the Attorney General and I have been engaging in focused discussions with the EU to find a way forward that will work for both sides. We are making good progress in that work.
I had a constructive meeting with President Juncker in Brussels last week, to take stock of the work done by our respective teams.
We discussed the legal changes that are required to guarantee that the Northern Ireland backstop cannot endure indefinitely.
On the Political Declaration, we discussed what additions or changes can be made to increase confidence in the focus and ambition of both sides in delivering the future partnership we envisage as soon as possible – and the Secretary of State is following this up with Michel Barnier.
I also had a number of positive meetings at the EU-League of Arab States Summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, including with President Donald Tusk.
I have now spoken to the leaders of every single EU member state to explain the UK’s position.
And the UK and EU teams are continuing their work and we agreed to review progress again in the coming days.
As part of these discussions, the UK and EU have agreed to consider a joint work stream to develop alternative arrangements to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland.
This work will be done in parallel with the future relationship negotiations and is without prejudice to them.
Our aim is to ensure that, even if the full future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, the backstop is not needed because we have a set of alternative arrangements ready to go.
I want to thank my Hon and Rt Hon friends for their contribution to this work and reaffirm that we are seized of the need to progress that work as quickly as possible.
President Juncker has already agreed that the EU will give priority to this work. And the Government expects that this will be an important strand of the next phase.
The Secretary of State for Exiting the EU will be having further discussions with Michel Barnier and we will announce details ahead of the Meaningful Vote.
We will also be setting up domestic structures to support this work, including ensuring we can take advice from external experts involved in customs processes around the world, from businesses who trade with the EU and beyond – and, of course, from colleagues across the House.
This will all be supported by civil service resource as well as funding for the Government to help develop, test and pilot proposals which can form part of these alternative arrangements.
Mr Speaker, I know what this House needs in order to support a Withdrawal Agreement.
The EU knows what is needed.
And I am working hard to deliver it.
As well as changes to the backstop, we are also working across a number of other areas to build support for the Withdrawal Agreement and to give the House confidence in the future relationship that the UK and EU will go on to negotiate.
This includes ensuring that leaving the EU will not lead to any lowering of standards in relation to workers’ rights, environmental protections or health and safety.
Taking back control cannot mean giving up our control of these standards, especially when UK Governments of all parties have proudly pursued policies that exceed the minimums set by the EU, from Labour giving British workers more annual leave to the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats giving all employees the right to request flexible working. Not only would giving up control go against the spirit of the referendum result—it would also mean accepting new EU laws automatically, even if they were to reduce workers’ rights or change them in a way that was not right for us.
Not only would giving up control go against the spirit of the referendum result, it would also mean accepting new EU laws automatically, even if they were to reduce workers’ rights or change them in a way that was not right for us.
Instead, and in the interests of building support across the House, we are prepared to commit to giving Parliament a vote on whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU standards in areas such as workers’ rights and health and safety are judged to have been strengthened.
The Government will consult with businesses and trade Unions as it looks at new EU legislation and decides how the UK should respond.
We will legislate to give our commitments on both non-regression and future developments force in UK law.
And following further cross-party talks, we will shortly be bringing forward detailed proposals to ensure that as we leave the EU, we not only protect workers’ rights, but continue to enhance them.
Mr Speaker, as the government committed to the House last week, we are today publishing the paper assessing our readiness for No Deal.
I believe that if we have to, we will ultimately make a success of a No Deal.
But this paper provides an honest assessment of the very serious challenges it would bring in the short-term – and further reinforces why the best way for this House to honour the referendum result is to leave with a deal.
As I committed to the House, the Government will today table an amendable motion for debate tomorrow.
But I know Members across the House are genuinely worried that time is running out, that if the Government doesn’t come back with a further meaningful vote or it loses that vote, Parliament won’t have time to make its voice heard on the next steps. I know too that members across the House are deeply concerned by the effect of the current uncertainty on businesses.
So today I want to reassure the House by making three further commitments.
First, we will hold a second Meaningful Vote by Tuesday 12 March at the latest.
Second, if the Government has not won a Meaningful Vote by Tuesday 12 March then it will – in addition to its obligations to table a neutral, amendable motion under section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act – table a motion to be voted on by Wednesday 13 March at the latest, asking this House if it supports leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement and a framework for a future relationship on 29 March.
So the United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in this House for that outcome.
Third, if the House, having rejected leaving with the deal negotiated with the EU, then rejects leaving on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement and future framework, the Government will, on 14 March, bring forward a motion on whether Parliament wants to seek a short limited extension to Article 50 – and if the House votes for an extension, seek to agree that extension approved by the House with the EU, and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.
These commitments all fit the timescale set out in the Private Members Bill in the name of the Rt Hon Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford.
They are commitments I am making as Prime Minister and I will stick by them, as I have previous commitments to make statements and table amendable motions by specific dates.
Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article 50 extended. Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.
An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections. What kind of message would that send to the more than 17 million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now? And the House should be clear that a short extension – not beyond the end of June – would almost certainly have to be a one-off. If we had not taken part in the European Parliament elections, it would be extremely difficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper cliff edge in a few months’ time.
An extension cannot take no deal off the table. The only way to do that is to revoke Article 50, which I shall not do, or agree a deal.
Now, I have been clear throughout this process that my aim is to bring the country back together.
This House can only do that by implementing the decision of the British people.
The Government is determined to do so in a way that commands the support of this House.
But just as government requires the support of this House in delivering the vote of the British people, so the House should respect the proper functions of the Government.
Tying the Government’s hands by seeking to commandeer the order paper would have far-reaching implications for the way in which the United Kingdom is governed and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions.
And it would offer no solution to the challenge of finding a deal which this House can support.
Neither would seeking an extension to Article 50 now make getting a deal any easier.
Ultimately the choices we face would remain unchanged – leave with a deal, leave with no deal, or have no Brexit.
So when it comes to that motion tomorrow, the House needs to come together, as we did on 29 January, and send a clear message that there is a stable majority in favour of leaving the EU with a deal.
A number of Hon and Rt Hon Members have understandably raised the rights of EU citizens living in the UK.
As I set out last September, following the Salzburg Summit – even in the event of no deal, the rights of the three million EU citizens living in the UK will be protected.
That is our guarantee to them.
They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want them to stay.
But a separate agreement for citizens’ rights is something the EU have been clear they do not have the legal authority for.
If it is not done in a Withdrawal Agreement, these issues become a matter member states unless the EU were to agree a new mandate to take this forward.
At the very start of this process the UK sought to separate out this issue, but that was something which the EU has been consistent on.
However, my Right Hon Friend the Foreign Secretary has written to all of his counterparts and we are holding further urgent discussions with member states to seek assurances on the rights of UK citizens.
I urge all EU countries to make this guarantee and end the uncertainty for these citizens.
I hope that the government’s efforts can give the House – and EU Citizens here in the UK – the reassurances they need and deserve.
Mr Speaker, for some Hon and Rt Hon Members, taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union is the culmination of a long and sincerely fought campaign.
For others, leaving the EU goes against much that they have stood for and fought for with equal sincerity for just as long.
But Parliament gave the choice to the people. In doing so we told them we would honour their decision. That remains the resolve of this side of the House, but last night we learned that it is no longer the commitment of the Leader of the Opposition. He has gone back on his promise to respect the referendum result and now wants to hold a divisive second referendum that would take our country right back to square one. Anybody who voted Labour at the last election because they thought he would deliver Brexit will rightly be appalled.
Mr Speaker, that remains the resolve of this side of the House.
This House voted to trigger Article 50, and this House has a responsibility to deliver on the result.
The very credibility of our democracy is at stake.
By leaving the EU with a deal, we can move our country forward.
Even with the uncertainty we face today, we have more people in work than ever before, wages growing at their fastest rate for a decade and debt falling as a share of the economy.
If we can leave with a deal, end the uncertainty and move on beyond Brexit, we can do so much more to deliver real economic progress to every part of country.
So I hope tomorrow this House can show that…
…with legally binding changes on the backstop…
…commitments to protect workers’ rights and the environment…
…an enhanced role for Parliament in the next phase of negotiations…
…and a determination to address the wider concerns of those who voted to leave…
…we will have a deal that this House can support.
And in doing so, that we send a clear message: That this House is resolved to honour the result of the referendum and leave the European Union with a deal.
And I commend this statement to the House.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you.
I stand before you at this noble fortress of American liberty to pay tribute to the immortal souls who fought and died to keep us free.
Earlier today, the First Lady and I laid a wreath in their sacred honor at Arlington National Cemetery. Now we come together to salute the flag. They gave their lives to so boldly and brilliantly defend. And we pledge in their cherish memories that this majestic flag will proudly fly forever.
We’re joined for today’s ceremony by Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, Congressman Andy Harris, and a number of service members and veterans of the Armed Forces.
The dignity, daring, and devotion of the American military is unrivaled anywhere in history and any place in the world.
In recent months, our nation and the world have been engaged in a new form of battle against an invisible enemy. Once more, the men and women of the United States military have answered the call to duty and raced into danger. Tens of thousands of service members and National Guardsmen are on the front lines of our war against this terrible virus, caring for patients, delivering critical supplies, and working night and day to safeguard our citizens.
As one nation, we mourn alongside every single family that has lost loved ones, including the families of our great veterans.
Together we will vanquish the virus, and America will rise from this crisis to new and even greater heights.
As our brave warriors have shown us from the nation’s earliest days, in America, we are the captains of our own fate. No obstacle, no challenge, and no threat is a match for the sheer determination of the American people. This towering spirit permeates every inch of the hollowed soil beneath our feet.
In this place more than 200 years ago, American patriots stood their ground and repelled a British invasion in the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. Early on a September morning in 1814, the British fleet launched an assault on this peninsula. From the Harbor, some 30 British warships attack this stronghold. Rockets rained down, bombs burst in the air, and the deck of one ship, a gallant young American was held captive. His name was Francis Scott Key. For 25 hours, Key watched in dismay as fire crashed down upon this ground. But through torrents of rain and smoke and the den of battle, Key could make out 15 broad stripes and 15 bright stars barraged and battered but still there.
American Forces did not waiver. They did not retreat. They stared down the invasion and they held that they had to endure, the fact is they held like nobody could have held before. They held this fort. The British retreated. Independence was saved. Francis Scott Key was so inspired by the sight of our flag in the battle waged that the very grounds that he fought on became hallowed. And he wrote a poem. His ageless words became the anthem of our nation, The Star Spangled Banner.
Every time we sing our anthem, every time it’s rousing chorus swells our hearts with pride, we renew the eternal bonds of loyalty to our fallen heroes. We think of the soldiers who spend their final heroic moments on distant battlefields to keep us safe at home. We remember the young Americans who never got the chance to grow old but whose legacy will outlive us all. In every generation, these Intrepid souls kiss goodbye to their families and loved ones. They took flight in plane, set sail in ships, and marched into battle with our flag fighting for our country, defending our people.
When the cause of liberty was in jeopardy, American warriors carried that flag through ice and snow to victory at Trenton. They hoisted it up the mass of great battleships in Manila Bay. They fought through hell to raise it high atop a remote Island in the Pacific Ocean called Iwo Jima. From the Philippine Sea to Fallujah, from New Orleans to Normandy, from Saratoga to Sipan, from the Battle of Baltimore to the Battle of the Bulge, Americans gave their lives to carry that flag through piercing waves, blazing fires, sweltering deserts, and storms of bullets and shrapnel. They climbed atop enemy tanks, jumped out of burning airplanes, and leaped on live grenades. Their love was boundless. Their devotion was without limit. Their courage was beyond measure.
Army Green Beret Captain Daniel Eggers grew up in Cape Coral, Florida determined to continue his family tradition of military service. And it was a great tradition. He attended the legendary Citadel Military College in South Carolina. Soon he met a beautiful cadet, Rebecca. They fell in love, married and had two sons. In 2004, Daniel left for his second deployment in Afghanistan. On the morning of May 29th, Daniel and his team were courageously pursuing a group of deadly terrorists when he was killed by an improvised explosive device. This week is the 16th anniversary of the day that Daniel made the supreme sacrifice for our nation. He laid down his life to defeat evil and to save his fellow citizens.
At the time of his death, Daniel sons Billy and John were three and five years old. Today, they have followed in Daniel’s footsteps, both students at the Citadel planning to serve in the military. They’re amazing mom Rebecca has now served more than 23 years in the US Army. Everywhere she goes she wears Daniel’s gold star pin on the lapel of her uniform.
Colonel Rebecca Eggers and her two sons are here today, along with Daniel’s father, Bill, and mother Margot. To the entire Eggers family, your sacrifice is beyond our ability to comprehend to repay. Today, we honor Daniel’s incredible life and exceptional valor, and we promise you that we will treasure his blessed memory forever. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much, please. Thank you. Thank you.
Great family. Thank you very much.
To every gold star family here today and all across our land, our debt to you is infinite and everlasting. We stand with you today and all days to come remembering and grieving for America’s greatest heroes. In spirit and strength, in loyalty and love, in character and courage, they were larger than life itself. They were angels sent from above, and they are now rejoined with God in the glorious kingdom of Heaven.
Wherever the stars and stripes fly at our schools, our churches, town halls, firehouses, and national monuments, it is made possibly because there are extraordinary Americans who are willing to brave death so that we can live in freedom and live in peace.
In the two centuries since Francis Scott Key wrote about the stirring site of our flag in battle, countless other American Patriots have given their own testimony about the meaning of the flag.
One was World War II veteran, Jim Krebs from Sunbury, Ohio. Jim and his twin brother Jack fought side by side in General Patton’s Third Army. At the Battle of the Bulge, the twins volunteered for a dangerous mission. Together they took out four enemy tanks, two machine gun nests at a mother position that was very powerful. Loaded up with mortars, Jim’s brother Jack was mortally wounded. Jim held his dying brother in his arms, praying together as his twin passed away. Jim fought to victory and came home to build a great American life.
He married, had children, became an electrical engineer, and taught young people about war. As an old man, Jim was asked, what about the American flag and what it meant to him? Jim said, “The flag to me is as precious as the freedom that the flag stands for. It’s as precious to me as the thousands of lives that have been lost defending her. It’s that important to me. It gave me a value of life that I could have never gotten any other way. It gave me a value of my Lord, my family, my friends, loved ones, and especially my country. What more could I ask?”
Last month, Jim died peacefully at his home at the age of 94. This afternoon we are greatly honored to be joined by his grandsons, Andy and Ron. Please, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here.
Today as we remember the sacrifice of Jim’s brother Jack, we honor Jim service and we’re moved by his beautiful words. Andy and Ron, thank you for being here to remember your grandfather and his brother and what they did for us all. And most importantly, what they stood for,
From generation to generation, heroes like these have poured out their blood and sweat and heart and tears for our country. Because of them, America is strong and safe and mighty and free. Because of them, two centuries on The Star Spangled Banner still proudly waves. For as long as our flag flies in the sky above, the names of these fallen warriors will be woven into its threads. For as long as we have citizens willing to follow their example, to carry on their burden, to continue their legacy, then America’s cause will never fail and American freedom will never ever die.
Today we honor the heroes we have lost. We pray for the loved ones they left behind, and with God is our witness, we solemnly vowed to protect, preserve, and cherish this land they gave their last breath to defend and to defend so proudly. Thank you. God bless our military. God bless the memory of the fallen. God bless our gold star families, and God bless America. Thank you very much.

Franklin D. Roosevelt,"I have been on a journey of husbandry. I went primarily to see at first hand conditions in the drought states; to see how effectively Federal and local authorities are taking care of pressing problems of relief and also how they are to work together to defend the people of this country against the effects of future droughts.
I saw drought devastation in nine states. I talked with families who had lost their wheat crop, lost their corn crop, lost their livestock, lost the water in their well, lost their garden and come through to the end of the summer without one dollar of cash resources, facing a winter without feed or food -- facing a planting season without seed to put in the ground.
That was the extreme case, but there are thousands and thousands of families on western farms who share the same difficulties.
I saw cattlemen who because of lack of grass or lack of winter feed have been compelled to sell all but their breeding stock and will need help to carry even these through the coming winter. I saw livestock kept alive only because water had been brought to them long distances in tank cars. I saw other farm families who have not lost everything but who, because they have made only partial crops, must have some form of help if they are to continue farming next spring.
I shall never forget the fields of wheat so blasted by heat that they cannot be harvested. I shall never forget field after field of corn stunted, earless and stripped of leaves, for what the sun left the grasshoppers took. I saw brown pastures which would not keep a cow on fifty acres.
Yet I would not have you think for a single minute that there is permanent disaster in these drought regions, or that the picture I saw meant depopulating these areas. No cracked earth, no blistering sun, no burning wind, no grasshoppers, are a permanent match for the indomitable American farmers and stockmen and their wives and children who have carried on through desperate days, and inspire us with their self-reliance, their tenacity and their courage. It was their fathers' task to make homes; it is their task to keep those homes; it is our task to help them with their fight.
First let me talk for a minute about this autumn and the coming winter. We have the option, in the case of families who need actual subsistence, of putting them on the dole or putting them to work. They do not want to go on the dole and they are one thousand percent right. We agree, therefore, that we must put them to work for a decent wage, and when we reach that decision we kill two birds with one stone, because these families will earn enough by working, not only to subsist themselves, but to buy food for their stock, and seed for next year's planting. Into this scheme of things there fit of course the government lending agencies which next year, as in the past, will help with production loans.
Every Governor with whom I have talked is in full accord with this program of doing work for these farm families, just as every Governor agrees that the individual states will take care of their unemployables but that the cost of employing those who are entirely able and willing to work must be borne by the Federal Government.
If then we know, as we do today, the approximate number of farm families who will require some form of work relief from now on through the winter, we face the question of what kind of work they should do. Let me make it clear that this is not a new question because it has already been answered to a greater or less extent in every one of the drought communities. Beginning in 1934, when we also had serious drought conditions, the state and Federal governments cooperated in planning a large number of projects -- many of them directly aimed at the alleviation of future drought conditions. In accordance with that program literally thousands of ponds or small reservoirs have been built in order to supply water for stock and to lift the level of the underground water to protect wells from going dry. Thousands of wells have been drilled or deepened; community lakes have been created and irrigation projects are being pushed.
Water conservation by means such as these is being expanded as a result of this new drought all through the Great Plains area, the western corn belt and in the states that lie further south. In the Middle West water conservation is not so pressing a problem. Here the work projects run more to soil erosion control and the building of farm-to-market roads.
Spending like this is not waste. It would spell future waste if we did not spend for such things now. These emergency work projects provide money to buy food and clothing for the winter; they keep the livestock on the farm; they provide seed for a new crop, and, best of all, they will conserve soil and water in the future in those areas most frequently hit by drought.
If, for example, in some local area the water table continues to drop and the topsoil to blow away, the land values will disappear with the water and the soil. People on the farms will drift into the nearby cities; the cities will have no farm trade and the workers in the city factories and stores will have no jobs. Property values in the cities will decline. If, on the other hand, the farms within that area remain as farms with better water supply and no erosion, the farm population will stay on the land and prosper and the nearby cities will prosper too. Property values will increase instead of disappearing. That is why it is worth our while as a nation to spend money in order to save money.
I have, however, used the argument in relation only to a small area -- it holds good in its effect on the nation as a whole. Every state in the drought area is now doing and always will do business with every state outside it. The very existence of the men and women working in the clothing factories of New York, making clothes worn by farmers and their families; of the workers in the steel mills in Pittsburgh, in the automobile factories of Detroit, and in the harvester factories of Illinois, depend upon the farmers' ability to purchase the commodities they produce. In the same way it is the purchasing power of the workers in these factories in the cities that enables them and their wives and children to eat more beef, more pork, more wheat, more corn, more fruit and more dairy products, and to buy more clothing made from cotton, wool and leather. In a physical and a property sense, as well as in a spiritual sense, we are members one of another.
I want to make it clear that no simple panacea can be applied to the drought problem in the whole of the drought area. Plans must depend on local conditions, for these vary with annual rainfall, soil characteristics, altitude and topography. Water and soil conservation methods may differ in one county from those in an adjoining county. Work to be done in the cattle and sheep country differs in type from work in the wheat country or work in the corn belt.
The Great Plains Drought Area Committee has given me its preliminary recommendations for a long-time program for that region. Using that report as a basis we are cooperating successfully and in entire accord with the Governors and state planning boards. As we get this program into operation the people more and more will be able to maintain themselves securely on the land. That will mean a steady decline in the relief burdens which the Federal Government and states have had to assume in time of drought; but, more important, it will mean a greater contribution to general national prosperity by these regions which have been hit by drought. It will conserve and improve not only property values, but human values. The people in the drought area do not want to be dependent on Federal, state or any other kind of charity. They want for themselves and their families an opportunity to share fairly by their own efforts in the progress of America.
The farmers of America want a sound national agricultural policy in which a permanent land use program will have an important place. They want assurance against another year like 1932 when they made good crops but had to sell them for prices that meant ruin just as surely as did the drought. Sound policy must maintain farm prices in good crop years as well as in bad crop years. It must function when we have drought; it must also function when we have bumper crops.
The maintenance of a fair equilibrium between farm prices and the prices of industrial products is an aim which we must keep ever before us, just as we must give constant thought to the sufficiency of the food supply of the nation even in bad years. Our modern civilization can and should devise a more successful means by which the excess supplies of bumper years can be conserved for use in lean years.
On my trip I have been deeply impressed with the general efficiency of those agencies of the Federal, state and local governments which have moved in on the immediate task created by the drought. In 1934 none of us had preparation; we worked without blueprints and made the mistakes of inexperience. Hindsight shows us this. But as time has gone on we have been making fewer and fewer mistakes. Remember that the Federal and state governments have done only broad planning. Actual work on a given project originates in the local community. Local needs are listed from local information. Local projects are decided on only after obtaining the recommendations and help of those in the local community who are best able to give it. And it is worthy of note that on my entire trip, though I asked the question dozens of times, I heard no complaint against the character of a single works relief project.
The elected heads of the states concerned, together with their state officials and their experts from agricultural colleges and state planning boards, have shown cooperation with and approval of the work which the Federal Government has headed up. I am grateful also to the men and women in all these states who have accepted leadership in the work in their locality.
In the drought area people are not afraid to use new methods to meet changes in Nature, and to correct mistakes of the past. If overgrazing has injured range lands, they are willing to reduce the grazing. If certain wheat lands should be returned to pasture they are willing to cooperate. If trees should be planted as windbreaks or to stop erosion they will work with us. If terracing or summer fallowing or crop rotation is called for, they will carry them out. They stand ready to fit, and not to fight, the ways of Nature.
We are helping, and shall continue to help the farmer to do those things, through local soil conservation committees and other cooperative local, state and federal agencies of government.
I have not the time tonight to deal with other and more comprehensive agricultural policies.
With this fine help we are tiding over the present emergency. We are going to conserve soil, conserve water and conserve life. We are going to have long-time defenses against both low prices and drought. We are going to have a farm policy that will serve the national welfare. That is our hope for the future.
There are two reasons why I want to end by talking about reemployment. Tomorrow is Labor Day. The brave spirit with which so many millions of working people are winning their way out of depression deserves respect and admiration. It is like the courage of the farmers in the drought areas.
That is my first reason. The second is that healthy employment conditions stand equally with healthy agricultural conditions as a buttress of national prosperity. Dependable employment at fair wages is just as important to the people in the towns and cities as good farm income is to agriculture. Our people must have the ability to buy the goods they manufacture and the crops they produce. Thus city wages and farm buying power are the two strong legs that carry the nation forward.
Re-employment in industry is proceeding rapidly. Government spending was in large part responsible for keeping industry going and putting it in a position to make this reemployment possible. Government orders were the backlog of heavy industry government wages turned over and over again to make consumer purchasing power and to sustain every merchant in the community. Businessmen with their businesses, small and large, had to be saved. Private enterprise is necessary to any nation which seeks to maintain the democratic form of government. In their case, just as certainly as in the case of drought-stricken farmers, government spending has saved.
Government having spent wisely to save it, private industry begins to take workers off the rolls of the government relief program. Until this Administration we had no free employment service, except in a few states and cities. Because there was no unified employment service, the worker, forced to move as industry moved, often travelled over the country, wandering after jobs which seemed always to travel just a little faster than he did. He was often victimized by fraudulent practices of employment clearing houses, and the facts of employment opportunities were at the disposal neither of himself nor of the employer.
In 1933 the United States Employment Service was created -- a cooperative state and Federal enterprise, through which the Federal Government matches dollar for dollar the funds provided by the states for registering the occupations and skills of workers and for actually finding jobs for these registered workers in private industry. The Federal-State cooperation has been splendid. Already employment services are operating in 32 states, and the areas not covered by them are served by the Federal Government.
We have developed a nationwide service with seven hundred District offices, and one thousand branch offices, thus providing facilities through which labor can learn of jobs available and employers can find workers.
Last Spring I expressed the hope that employers would realize their deep responsibility to take men off the relief rolls and give them jobs in private enterprise. Subsequently I was told by many employers that they were not satisfied with the information available concerning the skill and experience of the workers on the relief rolls. On August 25th I allocated a relatively small sum to the employment service for the purpose of getting better and more recent information in regard to those now actively at work on WPA Projects -- information as to their skills and previous occupations -- and to keep the records of such men and women up-to-date for maximum service in making them available to industry. Tonight I am announcing the allocation of two and a half million dollars more to enable the Employment Service to make an even more intensive search then it has yet been equipped to make, to find opportunities in private employment for workers registered with it.
Tonight I urge the workers to cooperate with and take full advantage of this intensification of the work of the Employment Service. This does not mean that there will be any lessening of our efforts under our WPA and PWA and other work relief programs until all workers have decent jobs in private employment at decent wages. We do not surrender our responsibility to the unemployed. We have had ample proof that it is the will of the American people that those who represent them in national, state and local government should continue as long as necessary to discharge that responsibility. But it does mean that the government wants to use resource to get private work for those now employed on government work, and thus to curtail to a minimum the government expenditures for direct employment.
Tonight I ask employers, large and small, throughout the nation, to use the help of the state and Federal Employment Service whenever in the general pick-up of business they require more workers.
Tomorrow is Labor Day. Labor Day in this country has never been a class holiday. It has always been a national holiday. It has never had more significance as a national holiday than it has now. In other countries the relationship of employer and employee has more or less been accepted as a class relationship not readily to be broken through. In this country we insist, as an essential of the American way of life, that the employer-employee relationship should be one between free men and equals. We refuse to regard those who work with hand or brain as different from or inferior to those who live from their property. We insist that labor is entitled to as much respect as property. But our workers with hand and brain deserve more than respect for their labor. They deserve practical protection in the opportunity to use their labor at a return adequate to support them at a decent and constantly rising standard of living, and to accumulate a margin of security against the inevitable vicissitudes of life.
The average man must have that twofold opportunity if we are to avoid the growth of a class conscious society in this country.
There are those who fail to read both the signs of the times and American history. They would try to refuse the worker any effective power to bargain collectively, to earn a decent livelihood and to acquire security. It is those short-sighted ones, not labor, who threaten this country with that class dissension which in other countries has led to dictatorship and the establishment of fear and hatred as the dominant emotions in human life.
All American workers, brain workers and manual workers alike, and all the rest of us whose well-being depends on theirs, know that our needs are one in building an orderly economic democracy in which all can profit and in which all can be secure from the kind of faulty economic direction which brought us to the brink of common ruin seven years ago.
There is no cleavage between white collar workers and manual workers, between artists and artisans, musicians and mechanics, lawyers and accountants and architects and miners.
Tomorrow, Labor Day, belongs to all of us. Tomorrow, Labor Day, symbolizes the hope of all Americans. Anyone who calls it a class holiday challenges the whole concept of American democracy.
The Fourth of July commemorates our political freedom -- a freedom which without economic freedom is meaningless indeed. Labor Day symbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the average man which will give his political freedom reality.

Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much. We are with President Kenyatta of a wonderful country that we do a lot of business with, Kenya. One of the most beautiful countries, from what I understand, Mr. President.
We have lots of pictures and lots of people that tell me how beautiful your country is. And we do a lot of tourism. We do a lot of trade. And we do a lot of defense and security. And we're working very much on security right now. And I appreciate you very much being with us and your staff. This is really great. Your representatives have been dealing with our representatives and making a lot of progress.
We're talking about a very major highway-roadway. And that seems to be going along well. That's a very important project, I think, for your country. And so we appreciate, very much, you being at the White House and being with us. And we look forward to the discussion. Thank you very much.
Good.
Well, you are here on a very special day because the stock market is up almost 300 points today. We just signed a trade agreement with Mexico, and it's a terrific agreement for everybody. It's been in the works for a long time. It's an agreement that a lot of people said couldn't be done, and we did something, and it was very special. Great for our farmers, our workers.
And our stock market just broke 26,000 for the first time ever in the history. So today we have the highest stock price we've ever had. And we're very happy about that. I said that was going to happen and it's happened. Everything I said is going to happen, it ends up happening. So you picked a good day to come.
We'll bring that over to Kenya. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
"
Donald Trump,"Lots of people were asking questions about Japan and also about Obama and what he's doing in terms of Japan. First of all, he was playing golf. I love golf, I own many golf courses.
They're great courses. I'm actually a good golfer. I want a lot of Club Championships, so I know more about golf than Obama knows, but you can't be playing golf when Japan is burning and crashing, you just can't do it.
You have to be on the phone. You have to be talking to these people. You can't be standing on a golf course hitting a golf ball with all of the problems that Japan is going through.
It's wrong, it sends a bad signal, it's horrible now as far as su pan is concerned, look, they've ripped us off for years. They've been a trading partner, but I don't call it a partner because they've made money. We haven't -- they've had tremendous surplus against the United States, meaning they've made a lot of profit over the years selling all their cars to us.
And by the way, if we go to them, it's not so easy. Somebody told me this morning that we only do three percent with them. I guarantee they do a hell of a lot with us.
So it's very unfair what they've been doing to us over the years. But I don't blame you pan. I blame our leadership.
We've had very, very foolish or probably the more correct word is stupid leadership and it's never been worse than it is now. Now here's the deal on a humanitarian standpoint. We really have to help Japan despite everything that's happened despite the fact that they have taken advantage of our very inexperienced foolish or as I said, stupid leaders.
The fact is we have to help them. They really need help. It's a country in turmoil, it's a country that hasn't been doing very well lately.
Last 10 years has been almost stagnant. They really do need help. We have to help them through this problem.
Lots of people are tweeting about the outsourcing of jobs. If you have an American Express card or let's say a credit card, let's not just blame American Express, although I believe they are one of the culprits. But you call in, you're going to get somebody from in, yeah, to tell you what's going on with your card.
Your balance your problems, why can't we do this? The outsourcing of jobs is a total disaster and in my opinion which attacks the outsourcing of jobs because if we tax them, two things are gonna happen. Number one, if they want to stay, that's great. We'll make money and number two, a lot of times they won't want to stay and they'll actually use our people, wouldn't that be nice and we'll increase employment in the United States.
So I would tax the accessing of jobs. I'm not really against it. If you have to do it, you have to do it, that's fine.
You pay for it tax, the absolute sea of jobs. Now what's going to happen again, we're gonna create a lot of jobs in this country because a lot of these companies and some of them are great companies and very smart companies. They're not gonna want to pay the tax.
I would do that in a heartbeat. Many people are asking me and tweeting about my secrets to success. So just in a nutshell, it's a long subject.
I talk for hours about success and what it takes, but you've got to do something you love. You have to pick something, don't listen to your parents if they want you to do this or that you have to stay with what you love. If you love something, even if it's not going to be ultimately as good as maybe another type of job you've got to stay with it, you got to do something you love because it's gonna make your life a lot better.
Number two, never ever quit, never ever give up. Now you're doing something you love, it's a lot easier than ever to quit because you love doing and the other they get great knowledge, really work hard, understand your subject and that also boils down to loving what you do so work hard, never ever quit do something. You love you're gonna be successful.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much. It was great. The people are fantastic. That area of the world is great.
And we had a good time, and we had numbers that were even better than projected, so we're very happy about it.
Yes, I hear you. We just cut out.
My secret weapon is Ivanka. I saw you on one of the shows, and I was very honored, because I think you got it right. That was something we agree on.
No, about a week. It looks like it's about a week away.
And in fact, I've been to three cities now, and every time I go there, I say we have a hospital ready.
And she's a great person. She really is. She's great.
Well, I don't know. I'm not so sure about that, and you know, I have heard that a little bit. People sort of like that, some people, and some people probably don't like it at all, as you can imagine. But it's been a very interesting experience.
We're doing really well, and I'm in Nevada now, and I think you know, based on the polls, but of course, you never know what happens here. A lot of strange things happen here, and the caucus system is dangerous, to use a very nice word. It's sort of a dangerous system. But we'll see what happens.
We should do pretty well tomorrow.
That's right. He's a great guy. He's a great guy, and he really knows this state better than everybody, and I saw him actually today talking about that, so I hope he's right. I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it.
I really don't believe it's a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, that's my preference, but let's see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.
Well, we'll get them out at some point, probably. I mean, I'm looking at it. I told me people the other day start looking at it. You know, I have very, very complex, I have, did you ever see the picture, I tweeted a picture where the returns are like two feet high...
...which by the way it itself is ridiculous. But my returns are among the largest. I'm audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, I've had an audit for years.
And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So it's, you know, one of those things.
But we are working. They're very complex papers, but we're working on it.
I don't know. I have to ask my accounting people. But we'll be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule.
I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.
I think you would agree to that.
You know, they were...
Yeah.
Well, look, he's, we've had a lot of problems with him. And he's a person that doesn't like telling the truth. And I just find it hard to believe that some of the things he said. I can only relate him to me.
I can't relate them to Ben Carson. He did a thing called a notice of violation or a violation notice, and it was a voter violation, and it was a terrible document. It was a fraudulent document. People don't even talk about that.
You know, they talk about Ben, who really went through hell. I mean, what they did with Ben was incredible that he had left the race, and officially notified people that he had left the race, and vote for Cruz. That was terrible, and then they did the voter violation document, which looked like it came right out of the IRS. It looked so official, and scared people, and I guarantee, a lot of people went out and voted for him for that reason.
And you know, then you see the other things. He's done things with me that are incredible. You know, he did two robo-calls on election day in South Carolina, on election day, and they were terrible. One was on the confederate flag, and the other one was on, I believe, gay marriage.
And they were very, very rough, and very, very unethical to do. And that was done on election day. How would you like to be going to the polls, and you're notified that one came out, and then a couple of hours later, another one comes in. So he plays hardball, but, and I like hardball, and I've met a lot tougher people than him, believe me, many, many, many times tougher.
But he has a real hard time with the truth.
Yeah, that would be my ideal. That would be my ideal. You know, I mentioned one name, Diane Sykes, who's very good and very respected, and very conservative, also. I mentioned, actually, two names at the debate.
But, and those are both excellent names. Yeah, the ideal would be Scalia reincarnated.

John Prescott,"Two years ago, we inherited a Britain that was socially divided.
Public services were starved of investment.
Our environment was degraded. The air polluted. Water and rivers contaminated.
Local government was shackled. Housing investment slashed.
Rural communities neglected. A massive investment backlog, Disorganised railways, And crumbling roads.
That’s the legacy the Tories left us.
We are committed to reverse that.
On day one, we brought together a new government department whose very purpose is a better quality of life. Improving people’s homes, their neighbourhoods, their travel, the air they breathe, the water they drink.
There is much to do. But we have taken the essential long-term decisions to implement our manifesto Programme, and have a good ministerial team to implement it.
We have a new positive partnership with local government. No longer is local government treated as the enemy within. We value public services. We value public servants. And like them, we want to deliver better public services.
We promised to bring decision making closer to the people. We are giving London back to Londoners. Next May, Londoners will celebrate by ensuring their new mayor is neither Steven Norris nor Jeffrey Archer.
And alongside devolution in Scotland and Wales, We’ve taken a step towards the sort of regional government that I have long believed in, With Regional Development Agencies, new regional planning and accountability.
Two centuries after the world’s first Industrial Revolution, we face a new And momentous challenge – to renew and revitalise our towns and cities for a new age.
As Lord Rogers’ Urban Task Force report makes clear, This calls for nothing less than an urban renaissance.
It’s not just a matter of housing, planning or design.
It’s about jobs, transport, schools, crime and health as well – The whole quality of life in our cities and communities.
We have already started.
£5bn of capital receipts to help imporve2m homes as we promised.
£4bn to regenerate areas in need.
Almost a billion to help lift our poorest neighbourhoods out of the cycle of deprivation. Tackling the causes, not the symptoms.
A £350m package for our coalfield communities, To start to repair the damage caused by Mrs Thatcher’s spiteful attack on our pit communities.
We are offering jobs and hope, instead of despair and dole.
A new style of living – which puts people first – in the concept of the Millennium Village.
Built to the highest environmental standards The highest environmental standards. A social mix of housing. Excellent public transport.
The first two of these are at Greenwich by the Dome and in the mining town of Allerton Bywater.
Reclaiming contaminated industrial land to create a living, thriving, healthy community.
And I can announce today that we will invite proposals for a further five Millennium Villages in other part of Britain.
A new start for Britain.
And in the countryside, we have set up a new Countryside Agency to champion rural needs.
We are safeguarding rural schools and post offices.
And today, I can announce that our Rural Bus Fund is supporting 1,800 additional bus services, linking villages to hospitals, schools, jobs and market towns.
That’s social justice.
Well, let me tell you about the Tory Council of NorthYorkshire.
We gave the Council nearly a billion pounds from the Rural Bus Fund. The Council sent it back.
But local people want the bus services.
No doubt they will contact their local MP the leader of the opposition, Mr Hague.
No wonder the Tories are no longer the party of the countryside!
Under Labour, our air is getting cleaner. Our rivers and beaches are less polluted.
No longer is Britain tagged the ‘dirty man of Europe’.
And what about water supplies?
Every summer a crisis under the Tories.
We have got the privatised water companies to cut the leaks, repair the pipes at their own expense, and cut the water bills from next April.
And we’ve told them no more disconnection’s for families who can’t afford to pay.
That’s social justice. And it takes a Labour government to deliver it.
But the biggest environmental challenge we face is the poisoning of the earth’s atmosphere by the industrialised countries.
People see on TV the ice caps melting. Greater droughts. Fiercer storms. Rising seas, which threaten to wipe out whole coastal communities. They know something is wrong and they want action.
This is a global problem and needs a global solution.
That’s why Britain led the world at the UN Climate Summit in Kyoto, Negotiating legal limits to the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.
To take the lead in international negotiations.
Because, under Tony Blair, Britain is respected once again throughout the world.
And why do we do this?
Because we have an obligation to pass on to our children a better world that the one we inherited.
That’s what we mean by international solidarity – the essence of Labour’s beliefs.
That’s why we brought the environment and transport together, to get a more Integrated approach.
Of course transport is never out of the news.
The M4 bus land trial now means buses and taxis are getting through quicker. Cars are also getting through quicker.
Every week you get another alarmist news headline – seldom checked in case the truth gets in the way of a good story.
Reducing the speed limit from 70 to 50 – not true.
A policy to nick everybody, everywhere, driving over 30 – not true.
Anti-motorist – not true.
How could I be anti car, driving two jags?
It’s a pity we can’t have a more intelligent debate.
That’s why we set up the Integrated Transport Commission.
Anyway, people don’t pigeon-hole themselves just as motorists.
We are parents and pedestrians as well. People who drive cars care about pollution and their children’s future too.
We are not anti-car. We are pro-people.
Even the last Government came to accept that you can’t build your way out of congestion.
When the Tories came in, there were 70 cars per mile of road.
And, after £70bn spent on roods, this increased to 100 cars per mile of roads.
The worst option for the motorist is to carry on as before.
But John Redwood has disowned the last government. With promises of higher speeds, more tarmac, and ripping out road safety measures.
Even the Times newspaper called his plan “cheap populism”.
His solution to traffic jams is to deregulate the roads.
Fewer speed limits, fewer traffic lights – compromising safety.
What we need is a better balance.
In other European countries they own more cars. But they use them less. And they use public transport more.
Above all, we need to widen choice by steadily improving public transport.
For too long, politicians have dodged long term responsibility for short-term expediency.
I intend to do what is right.
Our policies are decided not for tomorrow’s newspapers, but for tomorrow’s children.
Our biggest challenge is to reverse the massive under-investment and damage of the Tory years.
As an ex-seafarer, I am particularly pleased that we are about to double – that’s right double – the size of the British registered fleet, under the Red Ensign.
That’s the kind of revival we are producing.
Under the Tories, privatisation saw rail companies re-painting their trains, instead of replacing them. The biggest beneficiary was Dulux.
Now billions of pounds are being invested in road and rail infrastructure.
Of course an ageing transport system that has been neglected for decades will have breakdowns and delay.
And you can’t put in brand new infrastructure without causing some disruption.
But we should celebrate the fact that public transport is now a growth industry.
We are making the investment for that to happen.
As we promised in the manifesto, As conference agreed last year, The new investment is from public and private sources.
New bus investment up 80%.
100 new rail stations.
1,000 more train services a day.
And we are getting more rail investment in 10 years than in the past 100 years.
New local transport plans will bring better quality and more choice in public transport, with £800m to kick them off.
In London we will hand over a £5bn legacy to the new mayor.
A package which includes the Light Rail crossing the river to Lewisham.
The new Jubilee Line extension, the Croydon Tramlink, and much more.
We are only able to do this because we are mobilising billions of pounds of private finance to serve the public interest.
But big investment can’t be done overnight.
Upgrading the national rail network.
Modernising the London Underground.
Completing the high speed Channel Tunnel Rail Link.
All these take time.
But we have established the new Strategic Rail Authority, To safeguard the public interest and develop the rail network – both passenger and freight.
Together with the new regulator, everyone agrees we now have a watchdog with a bite as well as a bark, acting on behalf of you – the public.
And I have today issued new instructions to the SRA to start the renegotiating rail franchises, to establish a new modern railway for a new century.
Last year I said the railways were a national disgrace.
Well, the industry has made some efforts.
The first signs of improvement are starting to show.
But I say to the rail companies: “You are on probation”.
By the next Spring Rail Summit, we will judge how far you have advanced.
Public private partnership is also the key to securing investment in the London Underground and Air Traffic Control.
That’s why we proposed in our Manifesto a £7bn public -private partnership to modernise the underground. A service which will be publicly owned and publicly run.
Where employees will have their employment conditions, pensions and free travel guaranteed.
We are mortgaging the Tube assets, just like you do with a house. And the assets will come back to the public sector, when they have been upgraded.
So it will be completely publicly owned once again.
I understand the concern about proposed changes in Air Traffic Control.
And of course we will continue to consult all the interested parties, including the unions.
But air traffic is growing fast. NATS want to use its expertise abroad to share in the growth of the aviation industry.
It needs over a billion pounds to keep up with growing air movements.
NATS has never been able to plan ahead to invest with certainty under past government financing.
NATS is an equity-based company already.
What is proposed is for government to keep a 49% stake, with 5% for staff – leaving 46% for the private sector.
We could ask the Chancellor to shell out the billions of pounds from public funds.
But that would mean less cash for hospitals and schools.
Some local authorities have swapped their paper shares in municipal airports to build new schools.
What’s wrong with that?
My own city of Hull has sold some of its shares in its telephone business to improve council services.
What is wrong with that?
So why shouldn’t we raise money from bricks and mortar to provide kidney machines and school computers?
Or – yes, in some cases – other forms of public transport that need investment funds.
This is a question of priorities.
As Nye Bevan said: ‘The language of priorities is the religion of socialism’
Our priority is not rigid dogma, but giving the people of this country the best possible public services
And using our public assets to the best possible advantage.
And let’s be clear about this. Whether it’s air traffic or anywhere else I will never agree to anything that would put safety at risk.
We will keep strict safety regulation entirely in state hands.
A government golden share.
A government director on board.
And a veto built in through the licence to protect the national interest.
Not a triple lock, but a quadruple lock.
The airlines are satisfied with that.
The RAF is happy with that.
And I think this Conference should trust this government would never put air passengers lives at risk.
I do not take exception to suggestions that I might be soft on safety.
All my life I have campaigned for transport safety.
From Lockerbie to Clapham Junction, I hounded the Tories.
In office, I have demanded train safety protection to stop trains going through red lights.
I have reopened the files on the sinking of the Gaul and the Derbyshire.
And last month I announced a public inquiry. So that the full story can be told of the Marchioness disaster.
So don’t let anyone doubt my commitment to safety.
I will never, repeat never, play games with people’s safety.
And I deplore those who seek to stir up safety for ideological or industrial ends.
Social justice. Labour is the party for the many, not the few.
But sometimes social justice demands that the many must help the few.
That’s why we have outlawed all forms of asbestos
– Britain’s biggest industrial killer
– That’s social justice
That’s why – as we enter the new Millennium We will guarantee every person currently living rough on the streets a bed to sleep in, with a roof over their head.
That’s social justice.
That’s why today Stephen Byers and I are announcing a new scheme to help pensioners and poor families who need help to make their homes warmer
And not just insulation, But brand new central heating.
To reduce the obscenity of deaths from hypothermia – that bring disgrace to this country.
That’s social justice.
It was that great post War Labour government which gave Britain its first National Parks, the jewels of the Countryside.
I remember as a boy the wonder I felt on my first visit youth hostelling to the Lake District.
Its beauty remained eternally with me.
50 years on, this Labour government will begin the process to create new National Parks – in the south downs and the New Forest.
Two new national parks for the new millennium.
A hundreth birthday present from Labour to the nation.
And we will introduce legislation to extend the right to roam and enjoy open countryside.
Because we believe our natural heritage is for the many, Not just the privileged few.
"
Oliver Letwin,"Do you remember?
Do you remember when Tony Blair offered us a new kind of politics? Do you remember that?
Well, we’ve had a new kind of politics.
It’s a kind of politics where nobody any longer trusts a word that politicians have to say.
We’ve had a new kind of politics.
We have a civil service, bigger than Sheffield. We have!
We have more officials in one department, the Department of Work and Pensions, than there are soldiers in the whole of the British Army. That’s a new kind of politics.
A new kind of politics, where a pensioner in my constituency is spending a third of her entire disposable income on council tax. That’s a new kind of politics.
Or the young person whose trying to get a foot on the ladder, trying to get a house for the first time, buying a house for £60,000 and 1 pence and they’re paying £600 of stamp duty.
Or the family expecting to inherit an ex-council house, and they’re paying death duties. That’s a new kind if politics.
It’s a new kind of politics.
When the Prime Minister, the first Lord of the Treasury hasn’t a clue what’s going on in the Treasury. Has to smuggle officials through the back door of No 10 to find out. That’s a new kind of politics.
Do you remember something else? Do you remember when they told us there was going to be justice for all? Social justice.
So when that pensioner in my constituency is paying a third of her income, her disposable income, on council tax, is that social justice? No.
Or when that young person, trying to get their foot on the ladder, is clobbered with £600 of stamp duty, is that social justice? No.
Or when that family expecting to inherit that ex-council house is paying inheritance tax, is that social justice? No.
You know what makes it all desperately unfair, so unjust, is that these people aren’t even getting value for money.
Do you remember the story of the woman who found that her rubbish was being collected half as often as before? The government said is it was some kind of directive, and the council said it was some kind of directive and they couldn’t do it anymore as well as they used to. And what did she do? She was probably a Conservative. She went out. She hired a private firm and she charged her neighbours and they were happy to pay. They pay all that council tax and then pay, on top, to have their rubbish collected.
Is that value for money?
Or when you’re sitting in a traffic jam, and you’re thinking of all those taxes you’re paying, is that value for money?
Or the parent who desperately wants to send their child to the school of their choice, and they’re appealing, and they know that 80% of the appeals in inner cities are turned down. Is that value for their taxpayer’s money?
Or your grandmother. The grandmother whose trying to get into hospital. She’s waiting 6 months and after paying taxes all her life. She gets in. She gets MRSA. Is that value for her taxpayer’s money? No. No.
And can we do something about all this? Can we take action to change things, to make a difference? You bet we can!
We can thin down this fat government by getting the money, from the taxpayer, the frontline where it’s needed. We can give the taxpayers of this country, something that they haven’t had these last seven years.
We can give the taxpayer value for money.
We’ve shown what that means. You saw the video.
You saw how line by line, department by department, we’ve been working through the fat bureaucracies. Working out how we can thin them down. Just last week Nicholas Soames and I announced what that means for frontline defence. By saving on the fat bureaucracies elsewhere in Whitehall, and by slimming down the bureaucracy within the Ministry of Defence, we can bring £2.7 billion more to frontline defence between now and 2008 than Labour plans, and that means we can save our regiments.
There is somebody else who’s heard about all this. Somebody who gets most of his best ideas from our programmes. You guessed it, Tony Blair.
So, he rings his neighbour next door, the neighbour from hell.
So it’s our Tony and our Gordon.
And Tony says to Gordon: “Gordon these guys, these Conservatives, they seem to be on to something. Couldn’t we do something to thin down the fat bureaucracies you’ve created?” Note the “you”.
And Gordon says: “Tony, give us a break. We’re Labour, we specialise in fat bureaucracies.”
And Tony says to Gordon: “Well Gordon, couldn’t we at least pretend that we’re going to do something to slim down the fat bureaucracies. Give us a hint Gordon.”
And Gordon says to Tony: “Now you’re talking. I can say we’ll cut 104,000 jobs out of the bureaucracy. 20,000 of those, well they’ll be in the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. We don’t have to do anything about them. 11,000? They’ll be reallocated. They won’t go anywhere. And to make up for the remaining 73,000, well, I’ll make up for them by hiring another 200,000 bureaucrats over the next 3 years, so we’ll end up with more than we started with.”
It’s a sham.
It’s a pretence.
And it means just one thing. It means Labour’s third term tax rises.
It means council tax on the average home rising to £2,000 a year.
It means £900 more of national insurance from the average earner.
It means Labour’s third term tax rises.
And can we do anything about that? Yes, indeed we can.
By thinning down those fat bureaucracies. By sticking within my tight spending plans. We can fill in Gordon Brown’s black hole and prevent Labour’s third term tax rises.
And by sticking to my tight spending plans, we should enable ourselves to do more.
We should enable ourselves to do something serious. To give us a simpler and a fairer tax system.
We should enable ourselves to give this country a serious remedy, for that pensioner who’s paying a third of her disposable income on council tax.
We should enable ourselves to give that family which has a person in it, a young person trying to get on the housing ladder, paying that £600 of stamp duty, some relief.
We should enable ourselves to give to the other family that’s expecting to inherit the ex-council house, some relief from the inheritance tax.
Yes. We should expect to be able to do something serious for those people.
Now, I know what many of you expect me to say next.
I know what some people in some sections of the media think it would be courageous if I said next.
They think it would be courageous if the next thing I said is: I promise you to cut taxes by so much and such-and-such a day.
It wouldn’t be courageous at all. It would be very easy.
I’d say it. You’d cheer. We’d all leave, and no one out there would believe us at all. Because there have been too many broken promises on tax, from too many politicians.
The sad truth is when we were in office, we made promises on tax we couldn’t keep.
And everybody knows what happened when Tony Blair said he had no plans to increase tax at all and then raised them 66 times by stealth.
So no more broken promises on tax.
Instead of promises, actions
Instead of words, deeds,
The next Conservative government will act to make a difference, to make Britain better.
On the first day of that government I will freeze civil service recruitment.
In the first week of that government I will lift the controls those wretched best-value, comprehensive, performance, assessment regimes of Labour government.
And in the first month of that Conservative government I will delivery a budget which will implement the James reforms, and begin the thinning down of those fat bureaucracies and set Britain on the path to a lower tax economy.
Actions. Measurable, accountable actions to make this country a better place to live in.
Shouldn’t be any kind of surprise to hear Conservatives talking about actions.
As we go forward into the next election, as we face that great test and meet that great challenge, let’s remind ourselves who we are.
We are the party of action.
We are the party of Shaftesbury who first took action to bring compassion into British politics.
We are the party of Wilberforce who freed the slaves.
We are the party of Disraeli, who elevated the condition of the people in order that he could make a Britain one nation.
And yes, we’re the party of Margaret Thatcher, who gave people the right to own their own homes, and gave Britain back her freedom and her security.
And now, our party, under the leadership of Michael Howard, as the next government of this can set Britain free again.

Grant Shapps,"The UK’s space sector can strengthen our national capabilities, create high-skilled jobs and drive future economic growth across the UK.
Getting the rules in place for space launches from UK territory may seem like one small step. But it paves the way for a giant leap in the development of our space sector.
This is technology’s high frontier and we will soon be able to reach it with specialist small payload launches from British soil.
"
Adam Afriyie,"We have just witnessed a wonderful debate on International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia that showed both passion and insight into the modern world. I am equally passionate about that subject, but this evening I wish to talk about the Lakeside Energy from Waste plant in my constituency. I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on this important issue.
Lakeside Energy from Waste is not just a local energy provider in Windsor; it is an establishment of local, regional and national significance. I have concerns about the plant’s viability and longevity if the third runway should go ahead at Heathrow, or even if it is threatened that the third runway should go ahead at Heathrow, and I will explain why.
The Lakeside Energy from Waste facility is situated on the proposed site of the third runway at Heathrow. The plant is the largest facility of its kind in England and has been in operation for just six years. The cost of relocation is estimated at between £500 million and £700 million and, from what I can see, with all the potential delays and all the other issues surrounding it, the cost could well run to as much as £1 billion. Those are large sums of money.
The site is of local significance because of the number of people it employs—around 300, plus others—so it provides local jobs. Regionally, it deals with 450,000 tonnes of waste each year, which is more than the non-recyclable waste produced in a year by the people of Birmingham and Manchester combined. It is a major national plant.
Some 90,000 tonnes of waste come from west London, 45,000 tonnes of waste come from south London and 30,000 tonnes of waste come from Surrey. Lakeside’s impact is one of national significance because it deals with 40% of the country’s hazardous waste, much of it medical waste. Seventeen NHS trusts, 500 GP surgeries and other medical establishments rely on Lakeside Energy from Waste.
The plant also provides electricity to the grid, powering up to 50,000 homes in the area, and of course Slough Borough Council enjoys the fruits of its labours in providing services to Lakeside Energy from Waste. I will not name the exact figure for commercial reasons, but a very large sum of money is taken in business rates by Slough Borough Council.
The hon. He points out that 4% of UK waste is processed through the plant. Like me, he is concerned that there will be a detriment to the local area unless there is a clear and orderly plan, with clear responsibilities, for a replacement plant if the third runway goes ahead. My right hon.
My first concern is that, if the facility is demolished and not replaced—if there is a gap in service—the effects locally, regionally and nationally will be enormously harmful due to the inability to process the levels of waste that it is contracted to process. The second problem lies in the timeline for Heathrow’s decisions about the third runway, because a replacement plant must be in place before the current plant is decommissioned to avoid a break in operations. Relocating the plant will take a minimum of five years, including one year alone for planning permission, three years for construction and another year for decommissioning the current plant. We can see how tight the timeline is, and the consequences will be enormous for waste processing if there is any gap in operations.
All that makes Heathrow’s target of having a new runway operational by 2023 pretty much unachievable as things stand, and that assumes there will be no objections to people having an incinerator and a waste processing plant located near their homes. As Members of Parliament, we know that there is always an enormous number of objections from local residents whenever a new operation of this nature is promised. As far as I can see, no sites for new incinerator and waste processing plant have been identified, so it is hardly surprising that I am concerned that a site may not be available.
The delays and uncertainty are undermining the fantastic business that Lakeside Energy from Waste represents. How will it be possible for people to sign long-term contracts with the plant if there is uncertainty about its future? I am sure that that is having enormous consequences for its operations. Given that the relocation costs are perhaps likely to be in the region of £1 billion—the current estimate is £500 million to £700 million, but it could run towards £1 billion—that is an enormous amount in the context of the overall cost of developing a third runway.
Where is the money coming from? Airline charges are currently £22.53 per passenger, and rather than Heathrow Airport Ltd conjuring up the money to relocate the plant, passengers will bear the risk of the debt repayments on any secured loans and of ensuring a return on shareholder equity. Having the customers pay the enormous costs of something that does not necessarily benefit them directly does not seem like a good way to proceed with a national project of this nature. If Heathrow Airport Ltd raises the landing fee per passenger, it will probably have to go up to around £30 or £31, making Heathrow the most expensive airport in the world at which to land. If we are looking to become a more competitive nation, particularly as we head towards Brexit, it does not seem a good idea to proceed with a project that causes enormous challenges for waste recycling and processing and creates a white elephant when it comes to the price.
When considering the plant’s relocation, Heathrow’s financial viability is also called into question. As I said, the cost of relocation looks like it will be about 5% of the cost of the entire project. Looking at the gearing ratio of assets against borrowing, Heathrow is in a parlous position, so I worry that it will not be able to afford to proceed in the first place. We have become ​incredibly concerned because Thames Water’s gearing ratio is 81%, and it has been told that it must be reduced.
In 2012, the Civil Aviation Authority said that the National Air Traffic Services gearing ratio should be restricted to just 65%, yet Heathrow’s gearing ratio is already at 87%, before it has even begun the third runway project. If it goes ahead, Heathrow’s gearing ratio will end up somewhere around 91%. This is very worrying. Were I an investor, I would be worried, but as a Government I would be even more worried. As a user of the services of Lakeside Energy from Waste, I would be exceptionally worried that this would create enormous troubles for me, with a lack of continuity in waste processing.
Overall, my main concern is that there could well be a lack of continuity of service for waste disposal. I am also concerned that Heathrow’s viability in coming up with the money to finance the relocation of the operation, particularly without a site having already been identified, is in question.
I have two core questions for the Minister; he will have heard them before, but I want to reiterate them. First, will the Government confirm that they unconditionally accept the Transport Committee’s recommendation that
“a condition of approval”—
for the third runway—
“be specified in an updated”
national policy statement
“that provides the Lakeside Energy from Waste plant with equivalent recognition as the Immigration Removal Centres and that the replacement of its facilities be accounted for”
in the development consent order process?
Secondly, is there a way in which the Government can guarantee that there will be no break in service? If they maintain that
“the planning and costs of moving the Energy from Waste Plant would be a matter for the airport to take forward with the owners of the site”,
I fear that that responsibility may well be placed on a private limited company, when we are talking about a waste processing plant that is an asset of national significance. Although I hope this will not be the case, let us say that it turns out that Heathrow Airport Ltd is responsible for relocating the plant; who then is going to pay for the necessary local infrastructure—the roads and perhaps even some rail—for the heavy goods vehicles that will need access to the plant?
In summary, I have huge concerns. It is no great secret that I think the third runway is a bit of a mistake. I hope the decision will be changed at some point. In the meantime, I simply emphasise this: if we are going to have one more runway, would it not be far simpler, greener, less costly and, more importantly, quicker to proceed with the runway at Gatwick, which would not encounter these problems? Even the Government’s updated figures show that Gatwick gives a better net present value than Heathrow. A third runway at Heathrow would affect 2.2 million people more than they are affected today, and perhaps 300,000 people would begin to experience significant noise.
The Government have an opportunity to change their mind. When it comes to Lakeside Energy from Waste operations in Colnbrook, I urge the Government and the Minister to think carefully about continuity ​and who is responsible for this national asset, which provides such good services to the NHS, local authorities and others.
"
Donald Trump,"Wow, we have some big ones today, huh? This is a room loaded up. Wow. Hi Phil, how are you. We’ve got the all stars. A lot of all stars today. You too. You too. That’s good. Well, that’s fine.
Thank you very much. In the past four months, we’ve added 10.6 million jobs, including 643 manufacturing jobs and 658,000 construction jobs, that’s far beyond expectations. We’ve experienced the smallest contraction of any Western nation, meaning we’ve been affected less than any other nation, Western nation, and probably almost, I think you can put us in … I just saw some numbers. I think you can put us into just about any category anywhere, and the fastest recovery by far, and that’s anywhere. Nobody’s recovered like we’re recovering.
If we follow Joe Biden’s strategy, we’d shut down the entire country after just having set records on growth. We also did have tremendous retail growth, as you’ve probably noticed. We’re witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in our history. By contrast, the Obama/Biden administration had the slowest weakest and worst recovery in American history, as you know.
We continue to make progress in our fight against the china virus. New weekly cases have declined by 44% since July. Deaths declined by 20% compared to just last week, it’s going down very rapidly, really rapidly. This is in contrast to nations in the European Union, which have recently experienced a sharp increase in cases. They’re having a very big spike over there where we’re hopefully beyond our spike and we’ll see, but we’re doing very well all over our country.
In the past five weeks, per capita cases doubled in France, surged to over 300% in Spain, which I’ve been hearing about and speaking to some of the leaders of Spain and they were having a hard time, and increased more than 400% in Italy, again. And as you remember, I put a ban on people coming in from Europe, after the ban I imposed on China, Wuhan because of Wuhan, primarily, because that area was very infected. We also put a ban on Europe.
So Spain is being heavily impacted, France, and 400% in Italy. Yesterday, European nations experienced 50% more deaths than the United States. You don’t hear these things. You don’t hear these statistics, but the United States has done really well. I’m very proud of everybody that worked on this, and I really do believe we’re rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there.
But not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we’re rounding the corner. We already have therapeutics out there by the way, which are having, obviously, a very big impact because you look at the way people are recovering, it’s so much better than in the past. Before we knew about the disease and had anything to fight the disease.
On schools, as part of our science-based approach, we want schools to safely open and stay open. Children are extremely low risk of complications from the virus, less than 0.2%. 0.2% of the coronavirus deaths have occurred in those under the age of 25, and most had underlying conditions where there was a problem. There’s no substitute for in-person learning. According to a recent study, student progress in math decreased by half and using online education compared to in person or campus education. So online, we think of so many things online and how great it is. There’s nothing like being in the classroom. That’s what we’ve learned from this whole ordeal. According to the CDC, school closures disproportionately harm low income and minority children, as well as those with disabilities. I think you see some slides behind to me that are very new, very current.
It’s also crucial for colleges and universities to stay open. We hope that they do indeed say open, that we want to see big 10 football, we help it’s coming back. We have a lot of the colleges that we’re talking about, they want to come back. We hope that Michigan agrees. We hope that … and I know the governor will have a lot to say about it. We help she approves it, but we have a couple that … Maryland’s another one. We hope the governor puts a little pressure on so that we can have it, but I have a feeling they may do it.
They may do it without having everybody. But I think they’re going to have maybe Michigan, maybe Maryland. We have a couple of States that might not participate, but people are working very, very hard to get big 10 football back and I’m pushing it. It will be a great thing for our country, and the players and the coaches want to do it really badly, the players are missing. They only have so many years of this and the players are missing a big opportunity, including the chance, in some of the cases, to have some of the best players, college players in our country, and they want to get into the NFL and they want to make money in the NFL. They’re not going to be able to do that too easy if you don’t get to see them play.
It’s much safer for students to live on campus. Low risk young people would rather than the alternative. The alternative is no good. Then going home, spreading the virus to high risk Americans. They want to be on campus, they want to go back to school and the parents want them back in school, maybe more so than they want to be back in school. They want them back safely and they want to go back safely, but they have to go back. Based on the recent data for more than 20 colleges, not a single student who tested positive for the virus has been hospitalized. So that’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of students, not one has been hospitalized.
As we continue to follow the science based approach to protect our people and vanquish the virus, Joe Biden continues to use the pandemic for political gain. Every time I see him, he starts talking about the pandemic. He’s reading it off a teleprompter. I’m not allowed to use the teleprompter. Why is that Phil? They ask questions and he starts reading the teleprompter. He says, “Move the teleprompter a little bit closer,” please. I don’t know. I think if I did that, I’d be in big trouble. I think that would be the story of the year.
When I took early action in January to ban the travel, and all travel, to and from China, the Democrats and Biden, in particular, called it xenophobic. You remember that? Joe was willing to sacrifice American lives to placate the radical left, open border extremists. We saved tens of thousands of lives, probably hundreds of thousands of lives and we saved millions of lives by doing the closing and now the opening, the way we did it. Joe’s decision to publicly attack the China ban proved he lacks the character or intelligence or instinct to do what is right.
Now, Biden’s launched a public campaign against the vaccine, which is so bad because we have some vaccines coming that are incredible. Scott was telling me about some of the things that are happening and it’s very exciting. Scott, thank you for being here. But you don’t want to …
You don’t want to be talking about the vaccines in a negative way, especially when you see the statistics that we’re starting to see. They’re incredible actually. Biden’s perfectly happy to endanger the lives of other people by doing something that he thinks is going to help him politically, because his polls are getting very bad. They’re getting very shaky. This was an election that was going to be very easy, very quick, and then the China virus came in and I had to go back to work politically. Unfortunately, I had to devote more time politically than the other things we do, which are very important for our country, but I had to go back to work. And it looks like we’re going up very rapidly, more rapidly than the media wants to admit.
And Biden’s had to go out, he’s gotten out of his basement, and he’s working. Let’s see what happens, but we got to talk about how great these vaccines are. If in fact they are great. And I think you’re going to see numbers that are going to be very, very impressive. The approach to the virus is a very unscientific blanket locked down by the Democrats, that’s what they’re talking about, which takes all of these incredible statistics records and it throws them out the window. Now they did say it would be based on the recommendation of the experts, but whether the expert or not, we’re not doing any more shutdowns. We did the shutdown, and now we’re doing the opening, and there won’t be any more shutdown.
There could be a little section, a small section, we have a little breakout, but we’re not talking about shutdowns like they were talking about, depending on experts, we’re not going to be doing that. The Swine Flu was a disaster here, remember, when… Not nearly as deadly, not the same world, but when Joe Biden was Vice President, his failed approach to the Swine Flu was disaster, as he called it. He called it N1H1. It’s actually H1N1. You remember the H comes before the N, so it’s sort of easy to remember. But Joe Joe always calls it the opposite way. But we’ll call it the Swine Flu, it was disastrous. And his own chief of staff said that when Biden helped manage the Swine Flu in 2009, they, “Did everything possible wrong. And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time.” This is a quote from his chief of staff.
And it’s just purely a fortuity that this isn’t one of the great mass casualties events. It had nothing to do with us doing anything, right, because we did everything wrong. It was a disaster. It was a disaster. And now he’s telling us, how to manage, he can’t manage himself. 270,000 Americans were hospitalized during this attack. The outbreak was so rampant that the Obama administration told States to stop testing. “We don’t want any tests.” Because they don’t want to show all of the things that test show. By the way, we’re setting a record on testing. Our testing is at a level that nobody has ever seen before, where substantially greater than the second country, which is India, by the way, which has 1.5 billion people, but we’re 50 million tests ahead. 50 million ahead. And they ordered the CDD to stop counting tests and stop counting cases, and then left us a depleted stockpile, which is what I inherited. I inherited a depleted a very badly depleted stockpile.
In other words, Biden’s record demonstrates that if he had been in charge of this very serious, highly, highly contagious epidemic or pandemic, the China virus, countless more Americans would have died. And if we didn’t do what we did, and I say it all the time now, because the media likes to belittle what we’ve done, it’s has been incredible. Now you can look at Europe and you can look at other places, and you can start comparing. Biden is weak on China. Yesterday, it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, facilitated the sale of a Michigan auto parts producer to a leading Chinese military defense contractor. You don’t want to write about that, do you? Biden spent his entire career selling Michigan jobs to China. Now the Biden family is selling out our country directly to the Chinese military, which has to do with this company that Hunter, here we go with Hunter again, he didn’t have a job, now, all of a sudden he’s selling companies from Michigan to China.
China’s military got American manufacturing jobs, and the Biden family got paid a lot of money. And I said if Joe Biden ever got elected, China will own America. They will own America. Finally, I can announce with great pride that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be departing this evening on a historic trip to Doha, that’s Qatar, for the beginning of Intra Afghan peace negotiations. We’ve been negotiating with them for quite some time, getting along with them, moved a lot of soldiers out. I got a report this morning that there’s been nobody killed in Afghanistan since early February. That’s a long time. There’s been no deaths, no problems. And a lot of progress is being made in Afghanistan, but we’ll be down to 4,000 soldiers in a very short period of time.
Likewise, Iraq will be down to about 2000 soldiers in a very short period of time. And in Syria, for the most part, we’re out other than we kept the oil. As we have soldiers guarding the oil, not too many, I think smaller number, but they’re guarding the oil, and we’re helping the Kurds and were making their lives much more pleasant because of the fact that we have the oil. So we’re pretty much out of Syria, we’re pretty much out of Iraq and we’re down to the smallest force that we’ve had in what will be very shortly down to that number in Afghanistan. The negotiations are a result of a bold diplomatic effort. One part of my administration in recent months and years, the United States were playing an important role in bringing the parties together, to end the decades long war. It’s been going on for almost 20 years, long before I got involved, I can tell you that.
Had they not been wasting our time with all of the phony witch hunts and all of the things we probably could have done this even faster, but a lot of time had to be spent wasted like that. But the parties are together right now and we’re negotiating, and we’re really making tremendous progress. Next week at the White House, we’ll be having a signing between UAE and Israel, and we could have another country edit into that. And I will tell you, countries are lining up that want to go into it. As you know, UAE is headed by a very, very highly respected gentlemen, and respected by everybody. And he’s a warrior too. He’s a great warrior. And Mohammed’s very excited about this. And you’ll be hearing other countries coming in over a relatively short period of time. And you could have peace in the middle East. I think what ultimately.
… time, and you could have peace in the Middle East. I think what ultimately will happen is you’re going to have quite a few countries come in, the big ones are going to be coming in. I spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia, so we’re talking, we just started the dialogue, and you’ll have them come in. And I think two things are going to happen, Iran will, if we win the election, Iran will come and sign a deal with us very rapidly within the first, I would say, week, but let’s give ourselves a month, because their GDP went down 25%, which is an unheard of number, and they’d like to be able to get back to having a successful country again. So, I think that’ll happen. And I think very importantly, the Palestinians will get back into the fold. And when they see all of these countries that frankly have been supporters of the Palestinians, very big supporters and certainly financial supporters… As you know, we used to pay the Palestinian $750 million a year, and I ended that some time ago on the basis that they didn’t seem to want to make peace, and we’ll think about it once we have a deal, but I’ve ended that quite a while ago. I’m frankly surprised they haven’t been to the table earlier, but this is the best way, this is a way that’s going to be great, this can really bring the Middle East together. And again, since February, we haven’t had a death in Afghanistan, which is… That’s a record for many years, not a death. And we’re getting along very, very well with the Taliban, and very well with Afghanistan and its representatives, and we’ll see how it all goes, it’s a negotiation. But, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, will be departing in a little while, so I think that’s very exciting news.
And a lot of people thought that my natural instinct is war, no, my natural instinct is actually peace. When we were on the debate stage, people used to say, “Will it be one week or two weeks before President Trump gets into a war?” But that’s not… I did rebuild our military, we have a military that… $2.5 trillion new jets, and rockets, and tanks, and ships, and a lot of things we have, we have the newest, best military we’ve ever had, so hopefully we won’t have to use it. Our nuclear program has been put into gear like never before, and in particular, hopefully, we won’t have to use that, because that’s a whole new level of destruction that we never want to… Just have to pray to God we never have to use that. All right. Please, John.
That’s a terrible question, and the phraseology. I didn’t lie, what I said is, “We have to be calm, we can’t be panicked.” I knew that the tapes were… These were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls. And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work and not caring about his work, but I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of calls, so we did that. I don’t know if it’s good or bad, I don’t even know if the book is good or bad.
And your question, the way you phrased that is such a disgrace, it’s a disgrace to ABC Television Network, it’s a disgrace to your employer. And that’s the answer, you’re ready? Because-
… I love you… For a second.
Let me tell you something, we’ve had flu years… And five times, right? Five times. Do you ever hear the expression five times? We’ve had flu years where we lost 100,000 people. The flu is a very serious problem for this country also, and we’ve been losing them… Scott, what kind of a number have we lost over the years with flu into the hundreds of thousands?
But just so you-
Okay.
What I went out and said is very simple.
Listen. What I went out and said is very simple. I want to show a level of confidence and I want to show strength as a leader. And I want to show that our country is going to be fine one way or the other whether we lose one person… We shouldn’t lose any, because this shouldn’t have happened, this is China’s fault, this is nobody’s fault but China, China should not have allowed it to happen. Whether you have one person, 180,000 people or 2.5 or 3 million people, which it could have been very seriously if we didn’t make the moves. And when you look at the opposition where they said, “Oh, why did he put the ban on?” Dr. Fauci said, “We saved hundreds of thousands of lives by putting the ban on China, and then ultimately putting the ban on Europe.” There was no lie here.
What we’re doing is we’re leading, and we’re leading in a proper way. And if frankly somebody else was leading it, they wouldn’t have closed it. If you look at a Nancy Pelosi, you look at Cuomo, you look at de Blasio, you look at Biden, months later they said there’s no problem, they’re talking about me, months later. And before any statement was made, you have to remember, I put the ban on China, so obviously, outwardly, I said, “It’s a very serious problem.” And it’s always a serious problem, that doesn’t mean I’m going to jump up and down in the air and start saying, “People are going to die.” No, I’m not going to do that. We’re going to get through this. And we’re right now, I hope, really think we’re going to… We’re rounding the final turn. And a lot of good things are happening with the vaccines and with therapeutics. But there’s no lying, and the way you asked that question is very disgraceful.
But I do think so, I think we did a great job. And the people that did such… Our generals, our admirals, Mike Pence, all of the people that have worked so hard, and now Dr. Atlas, all of the… Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, they should be respected for the job they’ve done.
All I’m doing is… No, I don’t want to jump up and down and start screaming death, because that’s not what it’s about. We have to lead a country, we’re leading a great country, and we’re doing a great job, and the people that have done such a good job should be given the kind of credit that they deserve. We possibly have done the best jobs when you start looking at what we’re doing with the vaccines and therapeutics and ventilators. We had no ventilators, John, we make thousands of ventilators now a month and we’re supplying them to the whole world. The job we’ve done is the best job. And don’t give me any credit, give the people that have done this the credit, they’ve done a great job. Yeah, Phil, go ahead.
Well, I don’t know what Angela is doing. But if you look at the European Union right now, they’re having breakouts like you’ve never seen before, and frankly, their numbers are at a level that…
… never seen before and frankly their numbers are level that are much worse than the numbers. Phil, we have done much, much better than the European Union. I just read you numbers that are not good on their behalf that are very good at ours, and we have rounded the final turn and we’re going to have vaccines very soon, maybe much sooner than you think. Listen, maybe much sooner than you think. But we have done a phenomenal job and the people that have done this job, including the American public, that’s had to put up with a lot, with the lockdowns and all of the things that they had to do, they have to be given credit. They have to be given credit.
Well, let me ask you this. If Bob Woodward thought that was bad, because this is stuff that everyone knew. There’s a report that I have here someplace where China said it was airborne earlier than the stipends I made. People knew it was airborne. This was nothing. This was no big. When I say it was airborne, everybody knew it was airborne. This was no big thing.
Read the reports. China came out with a statement that it was an airborne disease. I heard it was an airborne disease. I assumed it early on. The fact is there has to be a calmness. You don’t want me jumping up and down screaming, “There’s going to be great death!” and really causing some very, very serious problems for the country. If Bob Woodward thought what I said was bad then he should have immediately, right after I said it, gone out to the authorities so they can prepare and let them know. But he didn’t think it was bad. And he said he didn’t think it was bad. He actually said he didn’t think it was bad. The only one that said was bad or thinks it was bad were the fake news media, because they take it and they try and put it a certain way.
If Bob Woodward thought it was bad then he should have immediately gone out publicly, not wait four months. He’s had that statement for four months, maybe five months. He’s had it for a long time. It was a series of taped interviews, mostly by telephone, quick ones. Not long ones, quick ones. And I did it out of curiosity because I do have respect and I want to see, I wonder whether or not somebody like that can write good. I don’t think he can, but let’s see what happens here. Yeah, please.
Yeah.
Well, I can’t tell you that yet. I have to see. I’m not involved in it. I purposely stayed uninvolved. I’m, I guess, considered the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I could be involved if I wanted to. I thought it would be a better if I wasn’t. I think it’s better if our great Attorney General handle it. He has Durham who is a very, very respected man. And we’re going to see what it is. I can’t tell you that.
I can tell you this. They lied, they cheated, they leaked, they got caught. They spied on my campaign. Never in history has there been anything like this. And I guarantee you if the roles were reversed and I was on the Democrat side, people would have been in jail at the very highest level. People would have been in jail for two years already. Nothing like this has ever happened and the term would be for many, many years because it’s treason and other words can be used also.
Well, I think just on what I read in your wonderful papers and see what, just looking at the media, not even what I know. I think Comey is a disgrace to our country. I think Strzok, who just wrote a book, which is a total fake, is a disgrace. I think Page, Lisa Page, his lover, is a disgrace to our country. I think that when you look at McCabe where his wife got $700,000 in campaign contributions from Hillary Clinton. And then Hillary Clinton is under investigation, and yet she paid the head of the FBI, one of the top people, but actually the head because he took over for the other guy, who fortunately I fired, I made a good move when I fired him. That was a smart move because they were looking to take down this administration, duly elected administration. So I fired him. That was a great move when I fired him because maybe if I didn’t I wouldn’t be here talking to you as President.
But when McCabe’s wife gets $700,000 in campaign contributions when she was running for whatever office she was running from Virginia, and yet he’s in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton. Now he says, “Well, I wasn’t really in charge.” Of course, he was in charge. He was totally in charge. He knew exactly what was going on. These people got caught in probably the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They got caught. Now, what the Durham Report is going to say, I can’t tell you, but if they say half as much as I already know, just from seeing it. You have people, I watch some of the shows. I watched Liz McDonald. She’s fantastic. I watched Fox Business. I watched Lou Dobbs last night. Sean Hannity last night, Tucker last night, Laura. I watched Fox and Friends in the morning.
You watch these shows, you don’t have to go too far into the details. They cover things that are, it’s really an amazing thing. They got caught in the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They were spying on their opponent’s campaign. Not only spying, they were making up fake dossiers. You have the “Dirty Dossier”. It was all made up. It was all fiction. It turned out to be fiction. And then they were using that in the FISA courts, this revered court. Well, it’s not so revered anymore because when you look at what they did and how they played it, and they hurt a lot of people. General Flynn is still being hurt and is being hurt very badly. He’s a wonderful person. I spoke to General Millie about General Flynn two weeks ago. I said, “What do you think of General Flynn?” He said, “He’s a great soldier, sir, and he’s a wonderful, wonderful human being.” He’s been destroyed. He’s been destroyed.
Now, I think that without knowing anything about what Durham is going to release, the Durham Report we’ll call it, or maybe it’s going to be more than a report, maybe it’s going to be much more than a report, I don’t know, maybe it’s a report or maybe it’s much more than that, but when I look at the things that everybody in this room knows just from reading about it from yourselves back and forth, I think it’s a disgrace to our country. And I think if people don’t pay a very, very substantial price, it’ll happen again. And this should never, ever happen to another President. Thank you very much.
"
Donald Trump,"Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. Wow. Hello, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. And I’ll tell you, we’re landing and there are thousands of people along the runways, and I said, “Why aren’t they here?” “Sir, we couldn’t let them in.” “Why not? Let’s let them in.” Oh, these people. And then they put in a floor. This is for Manchester because you know about flooring. They put in a floor that’s like an ice skating rink. So we’re going to tiptoe around.
How are you, everybody? We love you. We love you. Great, great people. Manchester, we had some good memories in Manchester. 2016, but this is going to be, we are right now in the most important election in our history. But I’m thrilled to be back in the Granite State with the true hard-working American Patriots. Last night it was my great honor to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States.
We’re going to win. We’re going to win. Does anybody have any doubt? Does anybody… It’s very interesting, last night we had an incredible time and I don’t know if you know, it’s driving the fake news crazy. They’re back. But the poll numbers have swung. If you go back six months before the plague flew in from China, the plague, the horrible plague, this election was over. This election was over. And then I had to go back to work. I had to go back to work. And then I went back to work and we’ve done an incredible job in every aspect of running government, but I also had to start campaigning a little bit again, and I did.
And today it was announced that Joe Biden is coming out of the basement. Because the poll numbers have totally swung. They totally swung. And they’ve swung like nobody’s ever seen them swing before. And it was rapid. It was a rapid swing. Because they all admit that we’re doing a great job. There’s not too many presidents that have done a job like we’ve done, including keeping you out of wars, bringing you home from the endless wars. But they’ve swung.
But here’s what I don’t get. Sleepy Joe’s coming out he said in 10 days, that’s a long… 10 days. 10 days. That’s like an eternity in Trumpville. 10 days. I view 10 days is like an eternity, okay? So he decided he’s coming out and he’s going to be out in 10 days. That’s a long time. That’s a big percentage of the remaining time. That’s all right, he’s much better off where he is. I think he’s, I think he just…
We love Melania, we do. She did a great job. Did a great job. She did a great job. She went up on Tuesday night, did an incredible job. Last night was exciting, wasn’t it.
And how about those stories from friends of mine? How about those stories? Was that just compelling and incredible television, but really that was an exciting, a really good quality convention. Really great. So many people. So many people, you saw some tragic situations, some really great endorsements, you saw everything. If you… How about the endorsement of Herschel Walker? When you watch that that was from the heart. That was from the heart. Dana White today. I just saw it today because last night I was looking at this speech a little bit. We had a wonderful turnout last night.
What I didn’t like, you saw this right, when it was over, you saw when it was over? The thugs outside because the Democratic mayor of Washington DC, it’s another Democrat that’s not believing in law and order. And you know we give Washington DC a lot of money to run it, but they don’t do a good job of running it. The mayor, she doesn’t run anything. And these incredible people from all over the country, all over the world that were there last night, they walked out to a bunch of thugs. And that wasn’t, remember this, that wasn’t friendly protesters. They were thugs. They were thugs. And the DC police are good, but the mayor gave bad instructions last night, that should have never been allowed to happen.
When a senator like Rand Paul walks out, and thank God we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous… They took tremendous abuse. And Rand Paul was in big trouble last night, he’s a good guy, he’s a friend of mine, and that shouldn’t happen to anybody. But he is a US senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the White House and we ought to give them a medal of some kind, and we’re going to do it. We’re going to do it. I told that to Rand. And the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that’s what’s happening in Portland. And that’s what’s happening all over where you have Democrat-run cities. Just take a look. And we’re looking at the whole situation in DC, and tonight they have a lot of people gathering, let’s see how that works out. They have to be able to manage their affairs, they get a lot of money. She’s always looking for money, “Could we have more money?” “What are you going to waste it on? I mean spend it on. What are you going to waste it on, Mayor?”
And then our people walk out, and these are people from all over the world, they walk, including Congress, by the way, they walk out and they get accosted, they get abused, they get spit on. It’s a disgrace. And our country is going to change. We’re not going to allow that to happen. You know, we’re not supposed to be… We’re not supposed to be involved unless we’re invited in by the people that run, these are all Democrat cities, just so you understand, including DC. So we’re not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, but that’s a big statement. It’s a big statement. No reason for it. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to have to look at it. Mark Meadows is here, we’re going to have to look at it because we’re not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country.
And a weak guy named Joe Biden, and he’s weak, he’s weak as hell, a weak guy like Joe Biden didn’t even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire Democrat National Convention. Now they’re all of a sudden… Now they realize because they’ve gone down like a rock in water, they’ve gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden they’re talking all, “Well, we have to talk about crime.” Number one, they have no… Look at what happened to New York, look at what’s going on in Chicago, all Democrats, all radical left Democrats. Look at what’s going on in the great State of Wisconsin. Now I will tell you, two days ago we sent in the National Guard. That was the end of that problem.
Look at Portland. We want to send in the National Guard, we sent in Homeland Security just to protect our… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse, can you believe it? We sent in because-
… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse. Can you believe it? We send in because they can’t protect it. So we sent, they did a very effective job. We could take care of Portland in 45 minutes, 45 minutes. If that governor, if that mayor would call and say, “Please send in the National Guard.” just like … Hey, we did it in Minneapolis. Remember that? The place was going to burn down. Another few days, we send in the National Guard, it was over within an hour. They ought to get smart and that’s what they ought to do.
So now they’re talking about, “Well, we want to …” Why did they call it a friendly protest? Right? Remember the idiot from CNN, he’s standing there. This is a friendly protest. Behind him over his shoulders, the entire city is burning down. Sixty seven days from now, we’re going to win the great state of New Hampshire. We have to. We’re going to win four more years in the White House.
Within my first term in office, we’ve secured America’s borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the United States military. It was a mess. It was a depleted mess. Wiped out the ISIS caliphate, killed our terrorists enemies, kept America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. Achieved American energy independence. You see the price of your gasoline. When you go fill it up, “Oh boy, that’s a nice price.” It’s half what it was. We built the single greatest economy in the history of the world. That includes China, which was having a very, very bad year. Then the plague came in from China. We had to close it up.
We saved millions of lives and now we’re open again and we’re setting records. We’re setting records. Wait till you see the numbers just before the election. There’ll be released and this is despite the fact that the Democrats are holding back Michigan, North Carolina. You take a look. Pennsylvania. They want to keep them. By the way, on November 4th, regardless, they’ll be opening them up, November 4th, because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me, but our numbers are going to be great. We’re going to have a great third quarter. We’re going to have an unbelievable next year, unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes.
This November, each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country. I used to say it about 2016. This is now at a new level. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment, which will have no chance. Your vote will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow Biden to eliminate your jobs. By the way, it’s not Biden. It’s not Biden.
It’s his masters, his … They tell him what to do, his masters. They want to erase your borders, confiscate your guns, appoint radical left judges and prosecutors, tear down our history. Demolish your suburbs. You saw what I did. I ended the rule. You’re not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore, but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn’t want to write that, but everyone knows. Unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be, they know that. They want to destroy your suburbs, indoctrinate our children, defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like Portland, Oregon than what we’re used to looking at. Never forget, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. It’s true.
Today’s Democrat party is filled with hate. Just look at Joe Biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage. Right? You see it. It’s crazy. It’s crazy. You ought to see last night in Washington. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace that these people are representing the United States of America. It was a disgrace. Protesters. You know what I say? Protest is your ass. I don’t talk about my ass.
They’re not protestors. Those aren’t … Those are anarchists. They’re agitators. They’re rioters. They’re looters. They’re not … You know you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there, “Oh, how dare you. These are friendly protesters, right?” Friendly …
They’re just looking for trouble. Has nothing to do with George Floyd. Has nothing to do with anything. They don’t even know who George Floyd is. Okay? They don’t know who George Floyd. They have no idea. If you ask them, “Who’s George Floyd?” They couldn’t even tell you. These are just bad people, troublemakers and they shouldn’t be representing our country at important events and we’ve got to stop it. Democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals, marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations, but they don’t believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together. You can’t go to church anymore.
You know how many churches are closed in this country because of the Democrats? You can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets, threatening other people, beyond threatening, kicking them in the face, doing what they’ve done. You’ve seen it. They would have done that to Senator Rand Paul last night. He’d either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn’t happen to be there. They took some big beating. The reason they didn’t fight back too much, they don’t want to lose their pension. They don’t want to lose their job, because we’ve become so politically correct, everybody’s afraid to do anything now, but they did a good job.
The puppet Biden, who’s just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings, funerals and school, but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets, mugging people, hurting people, robbing stores, looting stores, burning down storefronts. The radical left will do anything to get power. They smear justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and they are … Did you see anything like that? Justice Kavanaugh. People forget. Time goes by, they forget. We don’t forget. I don’t forget. They’re destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if Biden wins, which I honestly can’t believe can happen.
I will have lost to a low IQ individual. I don’t want that. I don’t want it. Sleepy Joe, I don’t want it. But the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government. Can you believe it? The levers, they call it the levers of government. The top 10 most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrats and have been for decades. Now they’re trying to impose those policies across the entire country. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. I can’t even call it Biden’s America. God doesn’t know he’s alive. He’s going to be out in 10 days. He’s going to start 10 days. Ten days.
I mean, I gave a big speech last night. I said, “What am I doing tomorrow night?” You’re going to New Hampshire, but sir, we can cancel New Hampshire because you had a big night. We can cancel. Are you crazy? I don’t have the courage to cancel New Hampshire. I got to win New Hampshire. I love the people and you’ve been very good to me. You’ve been very good to me.
You’ve been very good to me. So, New Hampshire was the first state I won. Right? Remember, I came here. I was very excited. That was an exciting evening. That was an exciting race, but we don’t talk about that anymore. We have to talk about the future. We don’t talk about it. That was great. It was important. We’ve done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country. That’s despite phony witch hunts, phony investigations, a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect. That’s despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by China, who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world, because China does not want to see me win I can tell you that. We’re not happy with China. I’ll tell you why. If Biden got in, China would own the United States very quickly. They’d own it. If the Democrat party wants to stand with anarchist, criminals, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that’s up to them. The Republican party and you, I can see you. Is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the American flag? Is there anybody?
Please quietly raise your hand. Be careful. Could be very dangerous. The Republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and our law enforcement. Right? We are all that stand between the American people and the left wing mob. If you want to save democracy from the mob, then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate. Look, I believe I have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the Democratic party, the worst. How do you get worse? I believe he’s the worst candidate, the slowest candidate. I mean, in prime time, he was the slowest candidate, which was a long time ago. Primetime. You know what I don’t like though, they say he’s like 78, 79, 78, I guess. Right? I know people that are 85, that are 88, 92, Bernie Marcus, Home Depot, he’s 92 years old. He’s the sharpest guy you’ll ever meet. There’s nothing … 78 is okay, but that’s a bad 78, not a good 78. 78 is okay, but he shouldn’t say that. They shouldn’t say … The press, they say he’s too old. He’s not too old. He’s not too old, but 78 is okay, but I do. I know people in their 90s that are 100% sharp and good physically, actually good physically. You want debate? So do I. I want debates too. I want debates too.
Tonight, we’re honored to be joined by New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Where is Dick? I think your great governor is here. Where’s the governor? Where’s our governor? Hi, Dick. Good job. Do we like Dick? Yes. Where’s our governor? He’s here. He just met me. I told him, “Go back.” Hi, Steve. Because you have a great governor and we don’t have same day voting anymore. We don’t have same day. What a joke that was last time, remember? Buses poured up from Massachusetts with a lot of people that weren’t going to vote for Trump, and they poured up thousands and thousands of people came in on election day and then you had a senator running on the Republican party who wasn’t exactly the greatest for us, but we have done so well here and we’re going to have a big win. I’m hearing we’re going to have a great win. So, I want to thank you, governor.
Also with us, our state representatives, Al Baldasaro and Fred Doucette. Where are you? Hi. Hi, Al. I know these guys so well. Hey Al, have I taken care of the vets better than you even thought?
This guy I met him. He’s a big vet. He wanted the vets. He didn’t care about anything else, but the vets. Honestly, he couldn’t have cared less about anybody here except the vets, but I did a good job, right? We did a good job for the vets. Very importantly, very, very US Senate candidate Corky Messner. Good, Corky. I hear you’re doing well. Good, Corky. Get them. We need Corky. Get them. I hear you’re doing well, Corky.
Congressional candidate Matt Mowers. Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Great people. A friend of mine for a long time, he said right from the beginning, “You’re going to win this state, sir.” We met him at the primaries. Chairman of New Hampshire Republican Party Steven Stepanek. Steven. Hi, Steve. Great Steve. Co-chairman of my New Hampshire campaign Lou Gargiulo. Where’s Lou? Lou Gargiulo. Hi, Lou. How am I doing? Are we winning, Lou? Lou, are we winning? Thank you. You said yes. If he said no, he’s out of here.
A friend of mine and a friend of the state, he loves this state and he is a smart cookie. So good. I love him on television. He’s no games. Just looks and gives her the answer, but he’s done a fantastic job. The first person on my whole … You read about all these people. This is the first guy and he’s a great guy and he’s a friend of mine, Corey Lewandowski. Where is Corey? Great guy. Tremendous guy. Tremendous help. Thank you, Corey. Are you having a good time, Corey? Who’s going to win this year, Corey? You bet. A little bit slow with that head, Corey.
With the help of everyone here today, we’ve accomplished more in the first three years. We’ve done so much. We’ve done so much. You can go over at taxes and you can go over what we’ve done with the military. We passed the biggest tax cuts ever, ever the history of our country. Now, they want to raise taxes. Think of it. All my life, I’ve watched politicians. Don’t forget, I’ve only been doing this for four and a half years. I haven’t been to … I’ve had senators come in. I’ve had congressmen come in. “Sir, I’ve been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years I’ve only lost three races, sir.” I said, “But I’ve only been doing it for four years and I only won one race, but now I have to win two. One race I won, but it was the president. It was for president.” It was for president, but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country. We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country. I ended the job killing Paris climate accord. That was a killer. That was meant to hurt the United States. By the way, in case you had any questions. Today, the United States is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. To give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn’t need it. Nobody here. Uh-oh, do you need it? Uh-oh. Don’t raise that … Oh she is? Is she okay? I’ll get it for her. Is she okay? We got to get her on the list. Tell me. Oh, from before. Well, that’s a long time before I was president. Does she want to get on the list? Because I’ve seen you at rallies before. I want to get … Will you please, I want to get his wife on the list. It’s called right to try. Right to try. Good work.
He’s been a friend of mine. Come on. He’s been here for a long time. He’s been a good guy for a long time. We got to … Is your wife, how she doing?
She couldn’t get it before me. Well, we had that with Mueller. You saw that with the Mueller’s last night. You saw that, right? Was that Assad with their incredible daughter, what happened? He said if Trump was president that wouldn’t have happened and they’re right, that would not have happened. We took out al-Baghdadi. I wish I were president, you would had a different solution. Thank you. Thank you.
Go ahead. How about you? Yeah. We’ll talk to you later. Right to try. You have no idea. So many people, they used to travel all over the world to get a cure. Now, we can sign a quick simple document. It sounds easy, it wasn’t, but it was easy for me. I understood it. Now, you signed a document. We give you the greatest medicines even if they haven’t been approved. If somebody’s terminally ill, like in the case of your wife, if somebody’s terminally ill, at least you have hope, but it’s beyond that because people have gone home. You have to see some of the results have been incredible. You saw one of the people the other day, right? That wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well. She’s a special person. She really is a special person. Thank you. We’ll talk to you. Thank you very much.
To bring opportunities to our inner cities, I signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. True. Before the China virus came in, before that China virus came in, we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country. We had almost 160 million Americans working. We had never had numbers like that. The Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln. Remember that. We-
We stand for so much, including Martin Luther King’s dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. You know that. The radical left’s effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart. There’s so much racial hatred, and it’s put there by CNN, by MSDNC… They stoke the flames and they know it. The good news is the ratings aren’t great. So that’s okay. They don’t have great ratings. But they stoke the flames. Uh-oh, CNN just turned off their camera again. They always turn off their camera. Why do I keep doing that? Every time I do it, they turn off their camera. They did it last time. I mention CNN, they’re screaming, turn the camera off.
Our movement is about a brighter future for all Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community. I’ve spent the last four years delivering for the African American community like nobody, with the exception possibly of Abraham Lincoln, has delivered before. It’s true. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from the last administration’s horrible, stupid, insane Trans Pacific Partnership. Would’ve destroyed the US auto industry and many other industries. New Hampshire lost one in four, and I think much more than that, manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO. It was more than one in four. That statistic is wrong. Please have it changed. The statistic is wrong, far more than one in four.
Earlier this year, I kept my promise and replaced the NAFTA nightmare with a brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. They said that couldn’t be done. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging and plundering of American jobs. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in America.
After years of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation and our jobs, and we’re taking care of our people.
Last night, I got great reviews of the speech and all, but some of the fakers back there, they said, “Well, it was a little long. He shouldn’t have used the White House.” Oh really? Tell me. But they said it was a little… Then one person, I think it was Chris Wallace. Nice guy. He’s actually a nice guy. He said that, “He didn’t have the same energy in the speech that he usually has.” Well, it’s a different kind of a speech. Tonight, I’m in New Hampshire and we can wing it.
See, actually, actually Chris, who has always wanted to be his father, but it never worked out because of a lack of talent. Actually though, actually Chris has it wrong. If I did last night’s speech here, by now you would have all been walking out. And if I did tonight’s speech there, I would have been criticized by being slightly radical. But we’re having a good time doing it this way, right? Because we are finally putting America first.
Under my administration, America’s borders are more secure than ever before. We ended the catch and release, stopped asylum fraud. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We’ve already built 300 miles of border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be completed. And our numbers on the border are the best they’ve ever been. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall. Just in case you didn’t know that. They don’t know that. They’re paying for the wall.
You haven’t noticed on the wall. Everything was wall, wall. They didn’t think I was going to get it done. Because look, you have one major party controlling Congress and they don’t want to give me a wall. So they’re going crazy. “Wall. The wall’s not getting done.” Then I get it done. Get it from the military, get it from everything. I’m a developer. I know how to get money. It’s one of those. Developers understand. And now that the wall is almost complete, it’ll be soon complete. And it’s the wall that border security wanted so badly. This is the one. But now that it’s built, you never hear about the wall. They don’t talk about it anymore. They don’t talk about it anymore. It’s incredible. But the wall will soon be complete. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. The space force.
And Al, in honor of you, we have passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, Al. That guy’s been bugging me for years. Al has been bugging me. What’s in that hat, Al? Let me see. Let me… It’s something. Al, he’s been bugging me for years. Did you ever think we’d get VA Choice, VA Accountability? Did you ever really believe it? Thank you, Al.
I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a disaster. $150 billion we paid Iran for a basically short term deal. And we gave them… What’s more impressive, we also gave them $1.8 billion in cash. Cash. Many plane loads. You know what that took? Many, many plane loads, $1.8 billion. I said bad. That’s when I realized how powerful a president is in the United States. When a president has the right, which by the way, I don’t believe he did have that right, okay? When a president has the right to go into the banks and take out $1.8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts, that’s power. That’s power. I don’t believe he had the right to do it.
I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the US embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East in 25 years. You saw that just last week. UAE, highly respected. Mohamed, highly respected. UAE and Israel. And now they’re all going to be coming in. Now they’re all saying, “How come you didn’t tell us about this?” You’ll have peace in the Middle East. And yet we’re moving our trips out. It’s pretty amazing, actually. We’ll get no credit for it, but that’s all right. Remember that Kaitlan. Cover that properly, Kaitlan. We like Kaitlan. Together, we’ve spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of Biden disasters. Joe Biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. He supported NAFTA. China’s entry. He’s done so many things. This man, if you look at what he’s done, we went into a deal, the Korea, you know about the Korea deal? Hillary Clinton’s deal, along with Biden. They promised 250,000 jobs, right? 250,000 jobs. And they were right. Except all those jobs went to South Korea. They didn’t come to us.
He wants mass amnesty. He wants illegal aliens to be taken care of, healthcare and every other way. Look, your taxes are going to go through the roof. He’s going to destroy your health care. He’s going to have socialized medicine. Remember what Obama said 28 times? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. Turned out to be a lie. Now you’re going to lose your doctor again. And we’re going to lose 185 million people who have private health insurance. Who has private health insurance here? And you love it, right? You love it. It’s luxury. It’s good. It’s beautiful. And you have the greatest, you’re going to lose it. Hate to tell you. Under his plan, you’re going to lose your private healthcare. So here’s a guy, I go into Texas two weeks ago. We had, by the way, on the highway and the roadways, thousands and thousands of people like lined up on the runway in New Hampshire, by the way. What happened to those people? But we had thousands and thousands of people. So I’m in Texas. I’m also, last week in Florida, we got total endorsement from all of the sheriffs. All over Florida. Ohio, many places. But think of Texas. He’s against oil and gas. He’s against guns. And he’s against religion. So you’re in Texas, you’re in Texas, where I’m winning by a lot. They say Texas is very close. I don’t think so. They said that last time too. Remember they said it last time? For them to call it early, you have to be really. So I heard, for a year, Texas is going to be very close. It’s going to be, everybody believed that except for the people that lived in Texas. So at 8:00, the polls close. And they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” Simultaneously with the closing.
I’m now running in Texas against a man who’s against oil, guns, and God. How do you win Texas? I said this, you could bring George Washington back as your Presidential candidate. You could bring Abraham Lincoln. Let’s put him as the Vice Presidential candidate. Run in Texas and other states, you couldn’t win. You couldn’t win. Now, they’re not going to win. We’re going to win this. And you’re against the oil stuff too. Because his whole thing on oil, no fracking, no this, no that. New England has the highest energy costs in the United States. And you know why? Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come.
And do you know where you buy your energy from? Russia. Did you know that? You have ships, much of it from Russia, because Governor Cuomo, New York won’t allow a pipeline and they’re desperate to have something happen in upper New York State. And those are great people, but they’ve been treated very badly. But they won’t allow a pipeline. By not allowing a pipeline, we’re trying to do it through essentially eminent domain. By not allowing a pipeline to go through upper New York State and create a lot of jobs for them, you have the highest energy prices in the United States by far. Thank you New York. Thank you. Thank you Governor Cuomo. Biden voted for the Iraq war. I was against the Iraq war. He opposed a mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. You remember that one?
He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and for the world. That’s not a positive development. Before they went into the WTO, China was flat lined. For years and years and decades, flat lined. And then they got into the WTO and a lot of bad things happened. First China’s stole our jobs, plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus. And now China is trying to just hug and kiss Joe Biden. They want him so badly. Look, if you like China, you should vote for Biden, that I can tell you.
How about his son? You think the son, maybe there’s a conflict? How about his son? Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? Does anybody know? Where’s Hunter? He’s in another country right now, probably, ripping off another country. No, as soon as Biden became vice president, bad things happened with respect to a Hunter. If that happened with respect to my family, I wouldn’t be standing. I guarantee you that. I guarantee you that. What a disgrace. What a disgrace. Ukraine. And it’s not just Ukraine and it’s not just China. But he goes into China, takes out $1.5 billion to manage, and he knows nothing, and he wasn’t even employed. He got thrown out of the armed services. So give me a break. It’s a disgrace, what’s happening.
There’s a double… There’s a thing happening with the media like nobody’s ever seen before. These people right here. Because if that happened to a Republican, in particular. If any of that stuff happened to me, it would be brutal. But it happened to him. They don’t want to talk about it.
And how about the questions asked by Anderson Cooper yesterday? Anderson Cooper. He’s interviewed me a lot over the years and I always got along with him, but they were tough interviews. Did you hear the questions? And Biden kept looking down. I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. Right? I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. And that’s happened before. And how about David Muir of ABC? He’s a nice guy, right? How soft were those questions? How soft were those? They don’t ask me questions like that. They got fire pouring out of their eyes. No. “Mr. Vice President, what do you think of this? How was your breakfast, sir? Did you enjoy it?” When I banned travel from China Biden, called it hysterical and xenophobic. He even used, somewhere along the line, the word racist. He always figures, they always want to get that word in there.
If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. But instead my decision, saved thousands and thousands of lives. And then we banned Europe very early because I saw what was going on, really in Italy and Spain and France. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Mike Pence did a great job. We produced more than 100,000 ventilators within weeks. And not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. You heard all about, and now we’re producing ventilators. Hard to produce. Expensive, complex. We’re producing them now for the rest of the world. 188 countries were affected by this. We pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate. And you look at this, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. 85% since April.
Under Operation Warp Speed, three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials. If you go back three years, that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss. It would have taken years. We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus. It’s already getting defeated.
And by the way, another big Democrat hoax. Another big hoax. I want football back. I’m the one that’s been saying. Is that a correct statement? I want football back. These are young, strong guys. They’re not going to be affected by the virus. If you look at it, it’s generally older people. Older people that have heart conditions, that have diabetes, that have problems. These are big strong guys. They’ll be just fine. But I want football back. I’ve been calling for football to be back, including Big 10. Big 10, get with it. Open up your season, Big 10.
And the Dems don’t want it back for political reasons. But now their new line… This is like Russia, Russia, Russia. All this crap they come up with. Now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down. They want to keep it shut down. And they’re saying that President Trump shut it down. I’m the one that wants it open. So they’re reversing it. They’re playing a big con game. It’s just a con game. And that’s what we’re dealing with. And we have to defeat them on November 3rd. I want football back and Big 10 open. And now the other day, Joe Biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown. He’d be willing to do another blanket. And we had to do it. We blanket, we shut down. We saved millions of lives. Instead of the number we have today, 175,000, we could have had 2 million today instead. It would have been unacceptable, unsustainable. Unsustainable. We did everything right. We did it right. We closed it down. We stopped China. We stopped Europe. Now we’re opening it up and we’re opening it up to record numbers, despite the fact that the Democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states, shut down as long as possible.
But now Biden wants to do another blanket shutdown, possibly, that would decimate the economy and cause suicides, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, heart attacks, joblessness. You’d have jobs, all of the problems that it causes. Because it’s not just a one sided equation. A shut down causes big problems also. And at this point, when the economy is roaring back. We had record job numbers this last quarter, over 9 million jobs. We’re going to throw that all out? We have a market… You know, your stock market. Who has 401k’s here? Your 401k’s and your stocks, when you have stocks, would be obliterated. And right now, we have just, on two of your markets, as you know, S&amp;P and NASDAQ, you’re at new records. And you’re about to hit another new record.
Think of it. Who would have thought the stock market? And hopefully we’re at the end of this horrible China virus. Came from China. They should have stopped it and they did. But who would have thought, just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now? Record levels.
And everything else is going to follow. Before the virus, we created an economic miracle and now we’re doing it again. We did the Paycheck Protection Program where we saved more than 200,000 jobs in New Hampshire alone. 200,000, right?
Over the past three months, we’ve gained so many different, if you look at retail numbers. Take a look at our retail numbers. They’re literally at records. Look at some of the numbers be announced by companies. They’re at records. Can you imagine giving that all up and starting again? It’s not acceptable. If I’m reelected, we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months, and we’ll do that easily. The Biden agenda, with big tax increases and big regulation increases, would immediately kill everything. You will go into a depression. And I’m very good at predicting this. You will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929, and who knows, maybe worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission.
… be worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes. They want to raise your taxes by $4 trillion. And that’s going to be almost everybody. They’re saying for the rich. No, not for the rich. They’re going to be raising everybody’s taxes almost. Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in American history and of our foreign adversaries, we’re devising a plan to destroy the United States from within. All they have to look is at the Biden Harris. How about her? Is she a beauty? What a beauty that is.
They pick a woman who starts off… She starts off sort of strong. She’s one of the favorites. Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two. Then she goes, “I’m going to leave because I’ve decided that I want to leave. I want to leave.” She left because she wouldn’t have gotten any votes. She was terrible. This would be your president possibly. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I want to see the first woman president also, but I don’t want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she’s not competent. She’s not competent. They’re all saying we want Ivanka. I don’t blame them. They want to eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a pandemic, suspend all deportations, restore catch and release, and expand horrible, dangerous, disgusting sanctuary cities. They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers. That’s what we need is more lawyers. Let’s get some more lawyers into the act. They want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations, very dangerous, and increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, you know crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time. You know why? Because of trade. Because I agree with Bernie Sanders, but my trade policies are much tougher than his and I’m able to do it. All you have to do is how is China doing last year with my trade policy? Not too well. And we had the best year we’ve ever had.
We’re going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade. They really like it because I’ve been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by China and many other countries, including, I hate to say it, our allies. Our allies have been ripping us big. And you heard me say last night, NATO, I got $130 billion from them first time going up to $400 billion a year from NATO countries, by saying, “You got to do it. You got to do it.” And general Secretary Stoltenberg said it can’t be done. He could not believe it. He’s actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote. Call him sometime.
They want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement. They want to end… We want to increase law enforcement, not cut law enforcement. And by the way, Pat Lynch is a great guy, New York, New York. Really great, New York’s finest, right? Their rights have been taken away from them. Literally they’re not allowed to do their job, but Pay Lynch, he said the first time in history that they know of New York’s finest have endorsed a candidate. The candidate is Donald Trump. First time they’ve done it.
All over the country, the sheriffs of Florida, all of Texas, all over the country, Ohio, law enforcement’s endorsing Trump. I cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements. If they do, please let me know and we’ll have a little discussion. We’ll ask why did that happen? They want to end school choice and ban charter schools. They want to abolish American energy, including all of the things I said before. And add to that coal and add to that shale. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a bright future, the American dream for all Americans. There is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years. So in conclusion, I have to say this. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world that’s happening already. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll do it here. Like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities.
We will kill our terrorist’s enemies as we’ve been doing while keeping America out of the endless foreign Wars. I go to Dover and I greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed. So sadly killed. It’s such a shame. I go to the hospital, I go to Walter Reed Medical Center. It’s incredible. The doctors are so talented. I see what they can do, but soldiers so badly hurt. And they’re really acting as police. They’re acting as police. Now, we’re very low in Afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops. We’re getting out. We’ll be getting out soon. We’re very low in Iraq. We’re very low in Syria, except we kept the oil. We left some behind for the oil. If you don’t mind, we kept the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq like I’ve been saying.
We’ll appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda, which is what we have in many cases right now. The next president will be in my opinion, responsible for two, three, four, and maybe, maybe even five US Supreme Court Justices. You better vote for me, you better vote for me or you’re going to have the greatest depression you’ve ever seen. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment.
We will surprise medical billing require, it’s already done. I signed it. Nobody can believe I did it. Price transparency. You know what that is? Do you know how big that is? Where you’re able to actually negotiate with hospitals, see their prices, compare it. You know who likes it? Good hospitals and good doctors. Other people don’t like it. It’s the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it, but I’ve already put it into effect. The bad news is it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure you elect me so I get credit for it.
Otherwise, could you imagine if sleepy Joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped, but he said, “I wonder what happened?” And I did it all. I’ll be so angry at New Hampshire. I’ll never speak to you again. Now, all these things, what we’re doing with drugs, we instituted a favored nations laws. We instituted favored nations. That’s going to drop your prices 50, 60, 70%. And I’m the only president in 51 years, last year, drug prices went down a little, not much, but they went down the first time in 51 years. Favored nations could drop at 50, 60, or 70%. On top of that, I instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman. So we will protect Medicare and we will protect Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful American flag. Do we love our American flag? Or Mars. Above all, we will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the New Hampshire state motto. Have you ever heard of these words? Live free or die. Live free or die. Vote for those people. And you do, you have a great governor. Vote for your people, vote for your governor. You have a great governor. From Portsmouth to Dixville from Concord to Keene. I know a friend from Keene. Great guy. I had a friend from Keene a long time. Keene, New Hampshire. And Merrimack to Manchester, we will fight for every job, every family and every neighborhood. We will fight for every vote. We have to win. We have no choice. Can I be honest with you? We’re working hard. We’re all working. I don’t have to do this. I could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe. That was mine. But that’s Air Force one. I get off that beautiful plane. I could come up and say, “Ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, you have no choice. You have to vote for me because if you don’t, you’ll be put in radical lefties. You’ll have a depression. Your stocks will be worthless. Your 401ks will be gone. There’ll be crime all over your streets. So I’m not going to work at all. I’m leaving now, but you have to vote for me because you have no choice.” Right? I could say it. Right? Right?
We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads. Won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater. We will be greater than ever before. Incredible citizens like you, the people of New Hampshire, helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country. We’re not going to let it.
We’re returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one nation under God. And we don’t take the beautiful word God out of our Pledge of Allegiance, do we? They did it twice. They it twice. Then they say, “Well, we didn’t mean that.” Oh, I see. I was listening once they said, “That’s right.” You don’t know what it is, what happened? What happened? They did it on purpose. They did it twice. That’s where they’re coming from. You can be fools and you can be fooled, but that’s where they’re coming from. So don’t be surprised, but they’re not going to get there. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs.
America will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of New Hampshire that have meant so much to me, and I brought down opioid and I brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it. 19. I talk about New Hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country, of any state in this incredible country. You had one of the worst problems of any of the states. And I talk about you a lot. It was incredible. And you still have. But we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked.
If it weren’t for the China plague, the number would be 25 or 30%. That really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don’t want to be shut down any longer. Joe, don’t you understand that? They don’t want to be shut down. So I worked very hard on that for this state and for other states, but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem. That wall is stopping them and it’s stopping them like never before. It’s stopping them like never before.
I want to thank New Hampshire for all you’ve done for me. I want to thank New Hampshire. You were my first victory, as I said, but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we’ve ever had. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you.

Alan Whitehead,"The cancellation of what would have been the largest energy project in Wales, if it cannot be reversed, could have huge consequences including the loss of between £15bn and £20bn in investment. It will also prevent the creation of thousands of jobs in the energy sector and wider UK supply chain.
We are already in the middle of an economic and unemployment crisis, yet the government has been completely silent on the potential loss of this power station and the economic impact for Anglesey and the region.
Ministers must urgently outline whether they plan to seek new developers to take on the Wylfa project, what conversations they have had with Hitachi about the site, and how they will ensure the people of Wales do not pay the price for Hitachi’s withdrawal.

Donald Trump,"Thank you, everybody, very much. Good morning and I greatly appreciate you being here. We have some real experts with us and we have some great bankers with us.
Today's discussion is crucial to my jobs agenda and to the American people. Community banks play a vital role in helping create jobs by providing approximately half of all loans to small businesses, and that's been dwindling because the community banks have been in big trouble.
Nearly half of all private-sector workers are employed by small businesses. We must ensure access to capital. Small businesses -- small businesses to grow. Community banks are the backbone of small business in America. We are going to preserve our community banks.
You probably know this -- I signed an executive order on regulation on February 3rd, I believe it was. And that's a big executive order, a very powerful executive order. It's taking a lot of the regulation away. You'll be able to loan. You'll be able to be safe. But you'll be able to provide the jobs that we want and also create great businesses.
So it's an honor to have you with us today, and perhaps we could go around the room. And we'll start with Dorothy, and say who you are and who you represent.
Go ahead, Dorothy.
Great.
Very good.
Good. Thanks, Scott.
Good, thank you.
Good. Thank you.
Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.

Robert Hudson,"As I said in the Second Reading Debate on the Petrol Bill last week, we thought that as discussion on the Bill was bound to be very narrow it would be for the convenience of hon. Members on all sides if we put down the Vote of the Ministry of Fuel and Power on as early a Supply Day as convenient; to enable us to discuss both the questions of policy connected with petroleum and petroleum products and also the administration of the Department. I will cover certain aspects and other points will be illustrated by my hon. Friends.
I will deal first with the record of the Ministry regarding fuel oil and, in particular, the conversion from coal to oil. Their record in this respect is typical. It is a history of panic, followed by order, counter order and disorder. The Committee will remember that in August, 1946, industrialists were asked to convert from coal firing to oil firing. As an inducement a rebate of 1d. per gallon on fuel oil was offered. This rebate was confirmed in the Finance Bill, 1947. The pressure by the Government on industrialists increased during 1946 and 1947 and was accentuated during the panic which arose out of what we always regarded as the unnecessary fuel crisis of 1947. The conversion involved the firms concerned in heavy capital outlay which was bound to increase costs of production. It also involved considerable quantities of steel and considerable engineering manpower, both of which we have been told on numerous occasions are short and constitute bottlenecks. The Government were warned by practical persons of experience of the difficulties ahead. They were told that there was a shortage of tankage and oil storage in the country and that other similar shortages were bound to cause difficulties and result in delay.
It is quite clear—and it should have been clear at the time—that a policy of this kind was justified only if it was certain that adequate supplies of oil would be available for running those oil firing installations after conversion had taken pace. The pressure to convert continued until the middle of 1947, but difficulties in the supply of oil began to multiply and industries failed entirely to get any adequate guidance from the Government. They could get no assurance that, if they converted, supplies of fuel would be made available. No definite guidance was given to industries, even in the speech of the Minister shortly before Christmas 1947; yet, as the Committee will remember, by that time the basic ration had already been abolished for several weeks on the plea of the shortage of dollars. Apparently what was done by the Government was to order a survey, but we have had no indication, of course, of the instructions given to the Government officials who conducted that survey. What is quite clear is that in more than one case the impression was given to the industrial concern that the difficulties in the supply of oil were likely to prove only temporary.
No clear lead has even yet been given by the Government, and the situation today is that some firms have installed conversion machinery and have no fuel, others have installed conversion machinery and can get fuel, some are still going ahead with conversions and others are now reconverting back to coal with the approval of the Ministry. No one has any idea what the Government’s policy is on this matter, and it is quite clear that uncertainty of this nature is bound to do industrial harm and hamper our efforts to increase the export trade. I hope, therefore, that the Government will give us a clear statement in the reply to be given to this Debate. What we should like to know, and what the country is entitled to know, is what is the estimate of the availability of fuel oil today, next year and the following year.
As illustrating the lack of certainty which prevails, I would only remind the Committee that the original estimate was 2 million tons of fuel oil to 3 million tons of coal, that the figure rose to 2½ million tons when the Government panicked in the winter of 1947, and that since then estimates as high as 5 million tons or even 6 million tons have gained currency. Which of these figures is correct, and is there any prospect of any firm commitment to supply oil? What policy do the Government recommend should be followed in the case of the three classes of firms concerned—that is the firm which has already completed conversion, the firm which is still engaged in conversion and the firm which is planning to convert? We should be glad of some information from the Government on that.
What is the excuse put forward by the Government for the shortage of oil in this country? It is that there has been a great increase in world consumption, and more particularly in consumption in the United States. It is quite true that the increase in consumption in the United States in the two recent years was equivalent to the total consumption in this country. It is equally true today that the total consumption in the United States is at least as great today as the total world consumption before the war. We admit that, but the question we are entitled to ask, and it is the question which the Government have never really attempted to answer, is why was this increase not foreseen. The Parliamentary Secretary, in answer to a Question on 6th April, said that despite the big increase per head in the United States the percentage increase in this country was even greater. That did not happen from one day to another. The Government must have seen that an increased percentage of consumption was taking place in this country, and it was only reasonable to presume therefore that a similar condition would prevail in the United States. What is the use of planning in these circumstances?
We are told that the increased consumption in the United States could not have been foreseen, but if rumour is to be believed many Ministers today have attached to them personal economists, and if rumour is again to be believed the unfortunate civil servants of many Departments spend a great deal of their time trying to pursuade the economic “boyfriends” of Ministers that their information and views are not as well-founded as they think. Assuming that there is some reason for the existence of these “boy friends,” surely it is to foresee the type of increase which has, in fact, taken place in the United States? Two deductions can inevitably be drawn from the history of the last two months. Firstly, that in oil, as in so many other cases, the Government are far more concerned in trying to explain what are their difficulties than in devising solutions to these difficulties. Secondly, that in pre-war days people in private enterprise who made such a gross error in calculating and forecasting, as has obviously been made by this present Government, would have lost their jobs in a very short time.
At the risk of introducing some old controversies, I should now like to say a word or two about the basic petrol ration. We on this side have never believed that the abolition of the basic ration was necessary. We believe that the decision was taken in a panic, and we believe that as a result of what has happened since the Government now realise they made a serious mistake. We regret, that while trying somewhat to relieve that mistake by the institution of a standard ration, they have accompanied it with a scheme which inflicts gross injustices on holders of E and S coupons. The abolition of the basic ration was justified by the Government at the time on the grounds that we were short of dollars.
We all agree that dollar expenditure, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, has to be reduced as far as possible, but, having said that, it still remains true that within the global figure of dollar expenditure we have to decide how many dollars should be allocated to this that and the other import, and in deciding what is the amount of dollars to be allocated to any particular import we have to balance the advantages and the disadvantages, both to the individual and to the national economy as a whole. We believe that if such factors are taken into account as loss of tourist trade, damage to the hotel industry, the inflationary effect of the loss of revenue, the expense involved in setting up the machinery for supplementary rationing, the inconvenience to the public and the unfair discrimination which has resulted as between the one user and the other, the balance lies rather towards disadvantage than to advantage.
The Government have made a great deal of play about the black market and the influence of the black market on the consumption of petrol in this country. I believe, in view of such figures as have been published, that that argument is nothing more nor less than a smokescreen. Because taking the figures of the Russell Vick Report, if I interpret them aright, the result is as follows: it was estimated that when the basic ration was in existence about 160,000 tons of petrol a year went into the black market, and it is now estimated that in spite of the abolition of basic petrol there is still a leakage in the order of 100,000 tons.
That would appear to mean that people who had basic petrol were using something of the order of 60,000 tons of petrol from the black market. The total basic ration was 800,000 tons. I suggest that 60,000 in relation to 800,000 tons was not such a figure as to justify the abolition of the basic ration and the inconvenience to which the community has consequently been put. What the Government ought to have done, if they believed that the black market was really serious, was to introduce measures such as we have been discussing during the past week; not now and not last January, but 18 months ago. Then they would have secured, if the figures are correct, a considerable reduction of dollar expenditure.
Our complaint is that the administration of the issue of supplementary coupons is rigid and unimaginative. I do not wish to delay the Committee by quoting a number of incidents, particularly as I have no doubt that hon. Members on every side of the House will be able to give instances which have come to their notice in their constituencies. I should like, however, to cite two cases. The first is that of a war widow with a semi-invalid mother, a father who is ill and not likely to recover, and a small child. In order to try, in the reduced family circumstances, to eke out her widow’s pension this lady decided to start again in the profession of architect in which she had been employed before the war. She began to practice from her own home. She could not afford to buy a car herself. Her mother has a car and a microscopic allowance of petrol. The lady asked for a small allowance in order that she might save time in the journeys she had to take in her professional capacity. She was told that there were adequate public services and that there was no ground for granting her application. Hon. Members will readily realise that she is able to devote only three hours a day on the average to her profession. The rest of her time is naturally fully taken up looking after her mother, father, and child. If she had to rely upon the public services her journeys would take two hours per day out of the three that she can devote to her profession, leaving her one hour a day. In fairness to the Minister I am bound to say that in a large proportion of the cases which I have brought to his personal attention he has been able, after having the cases investigated, to see his way to some extent to meet the request, and that this is a case in point.
I wanted to cite this case and I wanted to be sure of my facts, but the actual letters had been sent to the Ministry. I sent my secretary round to the Ministry yesterday to ask whether I might have the letters back because I wanted to use the case in my speech today. My secretary was told that if she waited a short while she could have them back. She waited, and eventually she received the letters together with a further letter signed by the right hon. Gentleman, granting the lady a small allowance, for which I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. Not having a “police state” mind I am quite sure that this was purely a coincidence, and a happy conjuncture which caused the letter from the right hon. Gentleman to be just ready to be signed by him so that it might be delivered with such promptitude to my secretary. The only reflection which has occurred to me has been that when the Bill which we were discussing yesterday becomes law, and if ever the right hon. Gentleman is accused of having red petrol in his car, that defence may not be the sort that would be accepted by a hardhearted magistrate.
The other case is that of the assistant to a county architect. He has to travel about the country, as will be readily understood. He has to travel to see about maternity homes, hospitals and similar institutions. One of his disabled colleagues has a small car. The county authorities authorised the architect to apply for a small allowance of petrol to enable him to run his friend’s car upon official business. The application was turned down. So important were the duties of this architect regarded by the county authorities that they gave the architect permission to hire a taxi for the use of him and his assistant on their necessary journeys.
I will give the House particulars of what has happened. A typical journey I am told is about 64 miles a day. If the architect had been given petrol the total cost to the county would have been 13s. 5d. per day. The total charges for the taxi for the same day amounted to £2 0s. 11d. The car that the architect would have used is an 8-horsepower and would have used very little petrol. The taxi is 12-horsepower, using much more petrol. We have been told of the need for conserving manpower. If the architect had been given a modest allowance of petrol he would have left the car wherever he was and there would have been no waste of manpower. In fact, the taxi man has had to wait, and has in fact waited for 4¾ hours a day. The net result of this admirable administration by the right hon. Gentleman’s Department, is that the county has had to pay at least twice as much, much more petrol has been used, and the taxi man’s time has been wasted hanging about all day. That is the sort of administration which the right hon. Gentleman has produced and to which we object.
I will turn now to the new scheme announced by the right hon. Gentleman in April. As we understand the matter, owners of E and S coupons will have no ration in future for their unfettered use, or rather the amount will be deducted from the total of their E and S coupons. The right hon. Gentleman is in a dilemma. He either assumes that the holders of E and S coupons have been breaking the law up to now and have been using their petrol for their own purposes, in which case his action encourages them, ex post facto; or else he assumes that they have not been breaking the law and have used their petrol for proper purposes, in which case he is inflicting grave injustice upon them by reducing their E and S coupons. No wonder they are angry.
The same thing applies to members of public bodies like rural district and county councils, hospital committees and so on. They all find that because they have been patriotic in the past by licensing their cars and using them on public business with their E and S coupons, they are to be deprived of the amount of petrol for their own unfettered use which their neighbours are to get. The right hon. Gentleman made a plaintive complaint the other day that nobody loved him. Surely the right hon. Gentleman can realise that practically every motorist—a large number of the public are motorists—believes that these regulations, restrictions and rationings are neither necessary nor reasonable and that the administration of them is unduly harsh. It is only reasonable that the right hon. Gentleman is not as popular as he apparently thinks he ought to be.
What about the future? What is to be the position in three or four years time, because that is equally as important as is the position today, and what are the Government doing about the future? Are we to have panic measures such as we have seen in each of the last three years during each of the years of the remainder of the Government’s life. In a speech on 8th April the right hon. Gentleman prophesied that there was to be a world shortage of petroleum, which he attributed to three factors. He said firstly, that the United States demand is growing; secondly, that there is and is going to be a shortage of tankers; and thirdly, that there is a shortage of refining capacity. What are the Government doing about each of these three factors? I am bound to say that their record so far on each of them is pretty lamentable.
It is often asked, in this connection, why, when we produce so much oil from sterling sources, we have to go to dollar sources; why do we have to buy American or dollar oil when production from companies under British control is far greater than our annual consumption in this country? The Lord Chancellor gave some figures the other day. He said that petrol production from British controlled companies amounted to 8 million tons a year. He gave the consumption for the United Kingdom as being 3,800,000 tons, that of the sterling area 5,600,000 tons, and foreign trade consumption as 2,900,000 tons, making a consumption of 12,300,000 tons, as against a production of 8 million tons, and he said that we had to provide the balance from dollar sources.
Those figures are very impressive. We should like to know this afternoon, as I am sure the British public would like to know, whether they are justified. Is the present scale of supplies which we make available to sterling countries and others outside the sterling area justified today? Is it right that so much petrol should go to other countries at our expense, when in England the basic ration has been abolished to the ordinary everyday motorist. Take the the item of 2,900,000 tons for foreign trade. I understand that it is made up as follows: for hard currency countries, 1,600,000, to soft currency countries, such as France, 450,000 tons; and to semi-hard countries—perhaps the Minister or Under-Secretary, in replying, will be able to explain what this rather nice phrase “semi-hard currency countries” means—850,000 tons.
The fact remains that there are very few countries, so far as I can discover, to which petrol is going at our expense, where restrictions are anything like severe as they are here. In Australia the basic ration is from six to 14 gallons a month, in Eire from eight to 12 gallons. In Denmark, one of the countries concerned, I believe that no rationing system exists, nor is there a rationing system in Belgium and Luxembourg. One certainly does not exist in Egypt and Ceylon. It is quite true that it is desirable in our present circumstances to export as much as we possibly can, and to reduce the dollar expenditure to the maximum possible extent. But we in this Committee are entitled to question the desirability of continuing, at a time when British motorists are so drastically restricted, to provide suplies of petrol to countries who pay for them very largely merely by running down their sterling balances. I query very much indeed whether the Government have adequately investigated this problem, and have done all that they can to see that if we are to provide petrol at our expense, the consumers in the country to which the petrol is provided should be subjected to something like the same restrictions as those to which we are subject in this country.
I turn to the Middle East. Can we have any estimate from the Government—I presume that they have made one—of the effect of the recent troubles in Palestine on Haifa, for example? I understand that the Haifa refinery was turning out something of the order of 4 million tons a year—a quantity equal to five times the basic ration in England—and that it is being closed down. What is to happen to that refinery, and to the new pipe line? We shall also be glad to know, and I think we are entitled to the information, what is the forecast by the Government of the effect of E.R.P. and the Marshall Plan? Are the American Government to continue to provide us in this country with petrol and oil products in order to enable us to continue to export those products to other countries?
Finally, I come to the question of refineries. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the shortage of refinery capacity as one of the limiting factors in the next few years. What are the Government doing about refineries? There are two main developments. There is the big refinery at Abadan, the biggest in the world, which requires continual enlargement. There are plans on foot for the erection of some four new refineries in this country. Oil, and especially refined oil, is one of the best methods of obtaining dollars in hard currency that this country can possibly have. Therefore, we on this side of the House believe that the increase of refinery capacity in this country and in Abadan should be given top priority. We should like to know whether there is truth in the rumours we hear that both the planning and the construction of these new refineries and the extension at Abadan are being held up by shortages of steel. If that be the case, as I believe, we should like to know what quantities of steel are involved, and by how much does the present allocation of steel to these items fall short of what the oil companies regard as reasonable in order to make good our position over the next three or four years?
The Government have hitherto refused to issue any figures of our steel allocation. The Ministry of Fuel and Power gave us a coal budget with estimates of the allocation of coal to different industries, the domestic demand, etc. This was extremely valuable and not only helped us in this House to get a better idea of the matter but also helped the country at large. Will the Government do the same thing in regard to steel, and if not why not? We are told that steel is the main bottleneck and yet we are refused any information. We believe that refinery priority should be right at the top of the steel allocation list. When we look around we see not far from here Government buildings being erected which must take appreciable quantities of steel. The country cannot in those circumstances believe the Government’s views about steel shortages.
I have said enough to show that the Government record to date so far as oil and oil products are concerned is one of failure. I do not blame the present Minister for the whole of that. After all, he inherited a pretty mess from his predecessor. There is no doubt that coal under nationalisation has a heavy load of responsibility to bear for our present difficulties in regard to oil. By its failure to produce plentiful supplies of coal for domestic industry in the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947 it intensified at the most inopportune moment possible the home and industrial demand for oil supplies, and by its failure to expand our export trade on anything like an adequate scale, it seriously aggravated a difficult foreign exchange situation. Too late now the man mainly responsible has publicly confessed the failure of his plans. The present Minister, however, must bear a large share of the responsibility for the fumblings and failures of his own term of office. In the light of that miserable record he need not be surprised that he is not loved by all.

There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to Berlin. And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with the Communists. Let them come to Berlin. And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Lass' sic nach Berlin kommen. Let them come to Berlin.
Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us. I want to say, on behalf of my countrymen, who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic, who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last 18 years. I know of no town, no city, that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force, and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin. While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of. the Communist system, for all the world to see, we take no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your Mayor has said, an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together.
What is true of this city is true of Germany -- real, lasting peace in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free choice. In 18 years of peace and good faith, this generation of Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their families and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all people. You live in a defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main. So let me ask you, as I close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin, or your country of Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.
Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free. When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe. When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades.
All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words ""Ich bin ein Berliner!""
"
Donald Trump,"Well, that I'm comfortable with, Hugh, and I sort of didn't believe the article, although I did see you on television talking about tone, that maybe the tone's a little bit tough. And we need tough tone in this country, Hugh. We can't have somebody like, I know you like Jeb, but Jeb doesn't have the tone. He doesn't have the enthusiasm or whatever it is.
You've got to, you need a little power right now. Our country's in big trouble.
You're not going to do it with a nice, easy tone, I can tell you.
Well, it's just an amazing thing. This is all the more example why EPA, we should do it locally. We shouldn't be doing it from Washington. It's disgraceful.
I'm looking at that every night now on the news, and the water is pure yellow. It's all acid, the worst stuff. Probably, you're right, probably going to kill the fish, kill everything. And it was totally their mistake.
They opened the wrong door and all of this stuff spewed out. I guess what you have to do, you know, sometimes, you have to sit back and watch, sometimes. Maybe they can channel it off or funnel it off or do something, but boy, it looks like a mess all caused because of the EPA. I mean, they go around and give people like me a violation if something minor happens.
It is so disgraceful what happened with that river, just incredible.
Well, that depends. Look, everybody makes mistakes. You have to recover from them. Like this is really a beaut.
You know, sometimes a mistake is big enough, you just can't, in your own mind, as a boss, you just can't get your arms around it and you say just get out of here, I want to start all over again. But this is a terrible thing, and I haven't, you know, when I heard, maybe it just even seems worse because it was so easily avoidable. They just made a pure mistake. Oftem times for a thing like this, you have to just get rid of them.
So I've been watching it very closely, and I don't see how other than she's got one thing going, and that's that all of the prosecutors are Democrats. And frankly, they want to keep their job. They maybe want to be elevated to a higher job. And maybe they don't want to prosecute.
If they're honorable, they have no choice but to prosecute, because what she did is far worse than Petraeus, on a much bigger scale. Petraeus' life has been destroyed. You know, he actually got two years on probation and all sorts of things. And I mean, her maximum penalty is actually 20 years.
Now let's not talk about 20 years, but her maximum penalty for this is 20 years. This was a much higher level of document than what Petraeus did. And look, she's, you know, I believe strongly you're innocent until proven guilty, but it certainly looks like it's a far greater problem than Petraeus had. And you know, I mean, they really, they came down hard on him and essentially destroyed his reputation and his life.
So I don't know. I just don't see, people say oh, well, how are you going to do against Hillary, and actually a poll just came out where I do very well, we're about even right now, and I don't even focus on Hillary now. I'm focusing on the other folks, you know, I guess you could say more friendly folks, and less friendly folks. I'm not exactly sure, and we're doing really well.
But I don't know if it's going to be Hillary. I think she's got a much bigger problem than running in an election.
I think I'd match up great. I'm a job producer. I've had a great record. I haven't been involved in plagiarism.
I think I would match up very well against Biden.
Absolutely. I mean, you do it, and you do it in a dignified way. Hey, look, I went to an Ivy League school. I was a great student.
You know, I had to sit in class, and sometimes, they weren't exactly exciting, but I was an excellent student at the Wharton School of Finance, which is the best in the world, one of the hardest to get into in the world, maybe the hardest, but one of the hardest to get into, even back then, I mean, it was always at that level, and did well, came out. I made a fortune. I made over $10 billion dollars, and that's a lot, and I only say that because that's the kind of, I'm not saying that as a braggadocios thing. that's the kind of thinking that our country needs, the kind of mindset.
I'm not saying the nicest person, the not nicest, although I like to be nice, but the fact is that's the kind of mindset or thinking we need to beat China on trade. I don't know if you noticed they just devalued their currency again.
They're killing us.
And the biggest, by the way, Hugh, the biggest in 20 years, the biggest in two decades, the biggest devaluation. They are killing us. They are taking our money, and then on top of it, they take out money, they take our jobs, they make our product, and we owe them $1.4 trillion dollars. We owe them right now $1.4.
That's like a magic act. Anyway, do the Apprentice, massive success, do The Art of the Deal, the most successful book, business book, you know, everything I've done. Now temperament, because I noticed that in your statement, and I actually saw you on television, we need a strong temperament in this country, and I tell the story that you know, illegal immigration, I don't even think, people would be talking about it if I didn't bring it up, and now it's a very important subject and a good subject, and people have apologized to me who came down on me because I was right. But if you look at what's going on in the world, heads chopped off if you happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, and there are plenty of other people having their heads chopped off.
We need a strong temperament. We don't need these people that sit around with very low-key, where everyone falls asleep listening to him. We need a strong temperament.
Well, I've been a great success. I'm the most successful person.
...to run for office, and I think that's what we need to turn the country around. I know what to do. I know how to get the debt paid off. I mean, I know things that other people won't have a clue.
And you need energy. You know, it's interesting, sometimes the word temperament, it's an interesting word to really define. But part of that word is energy. And I see some of the people, and I have great respect for a number of the people that we're talking about, the candidates.
Let's call them the candidates. But I have a lot of respect for some of them, and I've really gotten to like a few of them, but I must tell you, the word energy is very important. We need great energy. And some of those people, let's just use some, some of those people do not have energy.
And if you don't have the energy, which is a part of temperament, this country is never going to get better, it's never going to be great again, Hugh.
Well, I think you have to add, though, energy and good judgment.
Now I know people with energy, but they have bad judgment and they get themselves in trouble all the time. You know, you have to couple it with brains and you know, really intelligence. But you have to couple it with good judgment, because I do know people with a lot of energy and a lot of poor judgment.
Well, I was until I saw this article, I actually was. But I think you'll treat me fairly. Look, you're a professional. I was a little surprised, and you did talk about temperament, and again, you know, I was criticized on the same day by Bush and by Hillary Clinton, and they used the same word.
They say we don't like his tone, because his tone is a little aggressive, we don't need...well, I don't like their tone, because they don't have the energy. They don't have that push or that drive. And that's what we need. You know, we're behind the eight ball.
It's not like we're riding high and it's the opposite way. If the opposite way, we can low-key it, but we're behind the eight ball, so you need a strong tone. So it was very interesting, though, Hugh, at the same moment of the same day they both used the same term, and I was actually complimented by it. But what I can tell you?
Ah, it's so crazy. Well, first of all, nobody, and you actually said this before, nobody has been tougher on Hillary than I have.
Look, I'm the only one that came out and said what she did, and I said this two months ago, was a criminal act. I saw it two months ago. Nobody else, even now, they don't say it. I think the reason politicians don't say it is they think that they could likewise be there someday, so they're afraid to say it.
But I'm the only one that said it was a criminal act. Nobody's been tougher. And he did call me, and the reason, and by the way, he called me after. You know, there's a lot of false reporting.
He called me after I made my decision. And in my opinion, he was very unhappy when he heard what the outcome was. But he called me long after I made my decision. I made my decision, and I think, and you know, look, I have nothing against anybody, but I think that he wanted to find out if I'm actually doing it.
But he called after I made, not before I made my decision. And I said to people, look, they would know that if I run, because my whole life has been about winning. That's what we need in this country. I think that they would know, and he understands me well enough, that it's going to be their worst nightmare.
I will be their worst nightmare. And interestingly, a recent poll that came out, while I'm killing everybody in the regular polls in terms of the Republicans, one poll that just came out had me even with Hillary. And this was, I don't know why this would be, but I was a little bit down to Hillary when some of the other guys that I'm killing as a Republican, frankly beating badly, as a Republican, were even with Hillary. Well, one came out yesterday where I was even with Hillary.
You see, I don't worry about Hillary right now. I worry about her later. I want to do one thing as a time. I like to do, I would like to make it as simple as, it's a complex world.
I like to make it as simple as possible. But the first thing I have to do is this. But Hillary, I think, I really believe it might not be Hillary, Hugh, because of the fact that I really think she's got a huge problem with the emails.
No, not at all. He didn't ask me not to run, but I had already made my decision to run. He called me after I made my decision.
He didn't call me before.
It wouldn't have mattered. He would have had no influence. But he called me after I had made my decision to run.
Well, they have no respect for our president. They have no respect for John Kerry, who falls off bicycles at 73 in the middle of a negotiation that's very important, which by the way, it turns out to be, I think, one of the worst deals that we will ever make ever. And you know the sad part about that deal, and I found out about it three or four days ago, if the deal doesn't go through, we still have to give them the money. You ever hear of a deal like that? If the deal doesn't happen, we give them the money.
This is the most incompetent group of negotiators. As far as the South China Sea, which is what we're talking about, it's a long ways away. I flew to China not too long ago, and I was on a plane for 21 hours. That's a long, long ways away.
And at some point, we are going to have to stop being the policemen of the world, Hugh, whether we like it or don't like it. You know, they talk about Ukraine also. Now Putin can't stand Obama, and I understand that, and Obama can't stand Putin, either, but he can't stand him. And Ukraine, we're with them.
We're with the Europeans and all. But you know, wouldn't it be nice if Germany, who is minting money, they're coining money, they have an unbelievable, actually, they have a very smart leader. She's one of the great leaders of the world today, but Germany and all of these countries that are affected by Ukraine aren't the ones that are fighting. We are.
At what point do we say Germany, you know what, you better start handling Ukraine, because we have enough to do. We have to rebuild our country, Hugh. Our infrastructure is dead, our roads, our highways, our airports, our schools.
We don't have to worry about Ukraine. Now we'd be with the Europeans, but that's not a fight that should be led by us. That's a fight that should be led by the Europeans, and in particular, Germany, not by us.
Well, don't forget, you know, when he was doing it, it was a little bit different. They didn't owe $19 trillion in debt, they weren't going to be Greece in another six months if it keeps going the way it's going. You know, when you hit $24 trillion, that seems to be a very sacred number. That's the magic number.
When you hit $24 trillion, and we're going to be there very soon, because it's building up very quickly, and Obamacare is a disaster. Obamacare is going to add, it's got to be repealed and replaced by something better, but it's got to be. But when we hit that $24 trillion number, we become Greece on steroids. I mean, we have a lot of problems in this country.
We can't do what maybe they would have done in those days. Now that doesn't mean we can't come back to do it, Hugh, when we straighten ourselves out. But we have made so many mistakes, we have had such incompetent leadership in this country, that we really have to be in a position where we straighten out our own house first. We just can't be going all over the world fighting battles all over the world that have, in many cases, nothing to do with us.
And let Germany, let Europe, and we'll be with them. You know the expression we're right behind you, just go in there, we're right behind you. But if they don't want it bad enough, what are we doing? What are we doing?
Well you know, as far as Obama was concerned, and you know, I am the most militaristic, let's call it, of anybody that you've spoken to. I want to build our military, I want to take care of our vets great, I want to build our military so strong that nobody will ever mess with us. But in 2004, and I was sent a small delegation from the White House to talk to me, because I got a lot of publicity. It was actually on Reuters in July of 2004.
I said we shouldn't be going into Iraq, because we're going to totally destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq. You know, they always fought each other, Hugh, as you know, for many, many years.
They would fight, and they were equal. They were exactly equal. And you know, they'd move ten feet one way, ten feet the other, then they'd rest. Okay, then they'd go back.
We totally decapitated one of those equals. And I said that Iran will take over, and it turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction. So that's another interesting thing. It was just a big mistake.
So we've totally destabilized, and I said once we were there, keep the oil. All of these things that I said turned out to be true. So I said Iran will take over Iraq. That's already essentially happened, but it's happening as we speak.
And I said Iran and other people that are far worse than Saddam Hussein, ISIS, will take over the oil. That's happened. So the point is that we need people of vision. I am the only one out of all of these people that are running that said don't go into Iraq.
And yet I am stronger militarily than any of them. I will be, jobs will be my strength, but I think I'll be equally strong, militarily. We have to rebuild our military. We have to take care of our vets.
But, and I know how you feel, Hugh. I've heard you plenty of times. I know how you feel. But we have to straighten out our own house or we're not going to have a country left anymore.
Thank you very much, and remember, we need a strong temperament, Hugh.
So long.

Queen Elizabeth II,"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:
My husband and I look back with delight and gratitude on the events which marked My Silver Jubilee at home and overseas, and the visits which we made to many parts of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.

"
Caroline Spelman,"class=""Paragraph"">There is an important religious dimension to this debate and faith leaders shape public opinion, so I thought it might be helpful if I shared with the House the views expressed by the Church of England on the subject.
class=""Paragraph"">At a meeting of the General Synod last week, a motion on the migrant crisis called unanimously upon the Government
class=""Paragraph"">“to work with international partners in Europe and elsewhere to help establish safe and legal routes to places of safety, including this country, for refugees who are vulnerable and at severe risk.”
class=""Paragraph"">That motion passed with 333 votes and none opposing. The Archbishop of Canterbury made it clear that, in his view, force might be necessary to keep the refugees safe. He also said that the Church would not be forgiven if it turned inwards at this time of crisis. Rather, it must face the fact that extremism is now a feature of every major faith, including Christianity.
class=""Paragraph"">Cardinal Vincent Nichols has backed proportionate military intervention to tackle Daesh, and he cites Pope Francis saying that where aggression is unjust, aggression is licit against the aggressor. These are views which I share, which is why I will support the motion.
class=""Paragraph"">As the Prime Minister has said, this is not a war against Islam. Religious extremism is global and the key to solving this is the determination of people of faith to overcome it, not just in Syria, but right around the world. The Church is well placed to help, as the conflict is both theological and ideological. By reaching out to other people of faith and showing common cause in tackling extremism, we can demonstrate to a fearful secular world that faith leaders hold one of the keys to finding a solution. Where religion is being hijacked for political ends, we should say so.
class=""Paragraph"">The Anglican Communion offers a worldwide network of churches to deploy in the joint global endeavour to stamp out extremism. Together, the integration of hard and soft power is likely to produce a better outcome. I urge my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, who will be replying to the debate, to consider this question: to combat Daesh, it is important that prominent theological and ideological strategy is alongside any potential military humanitarian intervention. Unless we understand our enemy and those we choose as our allies in the region, we are unlikely to properly understand the conflict. I hope he will be able to inform the House what thought the Government have given to this advice as they develop their strategy.
class=""Paragraph"">The Church can also play an important practical role in offering hospitality, accommodation, support and friendship to refugees, whatever their religious tradition, and advocacy for those who are being persecuted because of their faith. Hospitality is seen as a spiritual gift by the Church and explains why this country, with its Judeo-Christian roots, has a long tradition of providing safe haven to successive waves of migrants. We need to recognise that the conflict may affect the number of migrants and displaced people, and the Prime Minister is therefore right to convene a donors conference early in 2016.
class=""Paragraph"">We should also recognise that international development aid agencies, many of which are Christian in origin, would emphasise that it is better to help refugees in their own region, so that once it is safe they can more easily return and rebuild their country. My local imam, who is from Syria and has family still there, is very anxious about the safety of civilians and the need to avoid a power vacuum.
class=""Paragraph"">The public will need continuous assurance and transparency about why action is being taken and what outcomes are being achieved, so I welcome the commitment to quarterly updates for the House.
class=""Paragraph"">It is all important how we give our international aid, during and post-conflict, and how we ensure that the voice of the displaced is heard in the post-conflict planning. As we know, it is the most vulnerable, and often the women, who have no voice at all in war. We have a duty to ensure that they are heard.
"
Donald Trump,"My fellow Americans. Next week, the Senate is going to vote on legislation to save Americans from the Obamacare disaster. Obamacare has wreaked havoc on American lives and if we don't replace it, the calamity will only get worse and I mean get worse by a lot. Here's just one story, representative of so many others.
Carrie Couey and her husband are cattle ranches. They have six children and the youngest is autistic. Her family's rates under Obamacare skyrocketed, eventually costing the Couey's three times more than their previous plan.
They were dropped from health insurance four times under Obamacare. When I met with Carrie in March, she told us that her family couldn't afford the equipment they needed to do the jobs while paying these crushing insurance premiums. Americans, like Carrie and her family, desperately need relief from this terrible, terrible law.
The Democratic politicians who passed Obamacare made many big promises, but they turned out to be lies. Absolute total lies. They promised Obamacare would reduce premiums by $2,500. Instead, premiums have skyrocketed by numbers that nobody can even believe, sometimes many, many thousands of dollars. They promised that if you like your plan, you could keep your plan. Instead, millions of American family saw their plans canceled.
They promised Obamacare would offer better options for American families, but in the past two years, half the insurance companies have pulled out and left the individual market. And today, Americans, in one-third of all counties, have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, and they probably will shortly have no insurers at all. The Senate health care bill stops the Obamacare disaster, expands choice and drives down costs, and I want to tell you: the Republican senators are working very hard to get something. That's going to be really, really good. The opposite of the big lie, which was Obamacare.
The bill would reduce premiums by 30 percent or more by 2020. It allows states freedom to escape even more of Obamacare's rules and create innovative health care solutions for their citizens. In other words, we'll be taking something away from the federal government and getting it back to the states who can better provide and who know better what to do.
It provides generous funding for people with expensive health conditions, which will lower premiums in the individual market. The bill doubles the amount that Americans can contribute to tax-free health savings accounts and allows you to use those accounts to pay your premiums. This plan provides states with a much needed flexibility to better manage their Medicaid programs.
It maintains Medicaid coverage for every single elderly American, disabled American, and American child who is currently on the program. It also expands the opportunity for people on Medicaid to purchase a private plan with federal financial assistance and with these much-needed long-term reforms to strengthen the safety net.
For our neediest citizens, the Obamacare repeal and replace plan would significantly reduce the federal deficit, so it would be good for the federal government. It will cost you less money by a lot and it'll be a much better plan. You can't do better than that. When I ran for president, I made a commitment to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare. I am pleased to report that we are very, very close to ending this health care nightmare. We are so close. The legislation working its way through Congress provides the choice and control people want the affordability they need and the quality they deserve in health care. It's a common-sense approach that restores the sacred doctor-patient relationship and you're going to finally have great healthcare at a lower price.
Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
"
David Cameron,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement. Today, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is publishing the report of the Saville inquiry—the tribunal set up by the previous Government to investigate the tragic events of 30 January 1972, a day more commonly known as “Bloody Sunday”. We have acted in good faith by publishing the tribunal’s findings as quickly as possible after the general election.
I am deeply patriotic; I never want to believe anything bad about our country; I never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our Army, which I believe to be the finest in the world. And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear: there is no doubt; there is nothing equivocal; there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong.
Lord Saville concludes that the soldiers of Support Company who went into the Bogside
“did so as a result of an order… which should have not been given”
by their commander. He finds that
“on balance the first shot in the vicinity of the march was fired by the British Army”
and that
“none of the casualties shot by soldiers of Support Company was armed with a firearm”.
He also finds that
“there was some firing by republican paramilitaries… but… none of this firing provided any justification for the shooting of civilian casualties”,
and that
“in no case was any warning given before soldiers opened fire”.
Lord Saville also finds that Support Company
“reacted by losing their self-control… forgetting or ignoring their instructions and training”
and acted with
“a serious and widespread loss of fire discipline”.
He finds that
“despite the contrary evidence given by the soldiers… none of them fired in response to attacks or threatened attacks by nail or petrol bombers”
and that many of the soldiers
“knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing”.
What is more, Lord Saville says that some of those killed or injured were clearly fleeing or going to the assistance of others who were dying. The report refers to one person who was shot while
“crawling… away from the soldiers”
and mentions another who was shot, in all probability,
“when he was lying mortally wounded on the ground”.
And the report refers to a father who was
“hit and injured by Army gunfire after he had gone to… tend his son”.
For those looking for statements of innocence, Saville says:​
“The immediate responsibility for the deaths and injuries on Bloody Sunday lies with those members of Support Company whose unjustifiable firing was the cause of those deaths and injuries”,
and, crucially, that
“none of the casualties was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or indeed was doing anything else that could on any view justify their shooting”.
For those people who were looking for the report to use terms like murder and unlawful killing, I remind the House that these judgments are not matters for a tribunal, or for us as politicians, to determine.
These are shocking conclusions to read and shocking words to have to say, but we do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible. We do not honour all those who have served with distinction in keeping the peace and upholding the rule of law in Northern Ireland by hiding from the truth. So there is no point in trying to soften, or equivocate about, what is in this report. It is clear from the tribunal’s authoritative conclusions that the events of Bloody Sunday were in no way justified.
I know that some people wonder whether, nearly 40 years on from an event, a Prime Minister needs to issue an apology. For someone of my generation, Bloody Sunday and the early 1970s are something that we feel we have learnt about rather than lived through. But what happened should never, ever have happened. The families of those who died should not have had to live with the pain and hurt of that day, and with a lifetime of loss. Some members of our armed forces acted wrongly. The Government are ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces, and for that, on behalf of the Government—indeed, on behalf of our country—I am deeply sorry.
Just as the report is clear that the actions of that day were unjustifiable, so too it is clear in some of its other findings. Those looking for premeditation, those looking for a plan, those even looking for a conspiracy involving senior politicians or senior members of the armed forces, will not find it in this report. Indeed, Lord Saville finds no evidence that the events of Bloody Sunday were premeditated. He concludes that the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments, and the Army, neither tolerated nor encouraged
“the use of unjustified lethal force”.
He makes no suggestion of a Government cover-up, and he credits the United Kingdom Government with working towards a peaceful political settlement in Northern Ireland.
The report also specifically deals with the actions of key individuals in the Army, in politics and beyond, including Major-General Ford, Brigadier MacLellan and Lieutenant-Colonel Wilford. In each case, the tribunal’s findings are clear. The report does the same for Martin McGuinness. It specifically finds that he was present and probably armed with a “sub-machine-gun”, but concludes
“we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire”.
While in no way justifying the events of 30 January 1972, we should acknowledge the background to the events of Bloody Sunday. Since 1969, the security situation in Northern Ireland had been declining significantly. Three days before Bloody Sunday, two officers in the ​Royal Ulster Constabulary—one a Catholic—were shot by the IRA in Londonderry, the first police officers killed in the city during the troubles. A third of the city of Derry had become a no-go area for the RUC and the Army, and in the end 1972 was to prove Northern Ireland’s bloodiest year by far, with nearly 500 people killed.
Let us also remember that Bloody Sunday is not the defining story of the service that the British Army gave in Northern Ireland from 1969 to 2007. That was known as Operation Banner, the longest continuous operation in British military history, which spanned 38 years and in which over 250,000 people served. Our armed forces displayed enormous courage and professionalism in upholding democracy and the rule of law in Northern Ireland. Acting in support of the police, they played a major part in setting the conditions that have made peaceful politics possible, and over 1,000 members of the security forces lost their lives to that cause. Without their work, the peace process would not have happened. Of course some mistakes were undoubtedly made, but lessons were also learnt. Once again, I put on record the immense debt of gratitude that we all owe those who served in Northern Ireland.
I thank the tribunal for its work, and thank all those who displayed great courage in giving evidence. I also wish to acknowledge the grief of the families of those killed. They have pursued their long campaign over 38 years with great patience. Nothing can bring back those who were killed, but I hope that—as one relative has put it—the truth coming out can help to set people free.
John Major said that he was open to a new inquiry. Tony Blair then set it up. That was accepted by the then Leader of the Opposition. Of course, none of us anticipated that the Saville inquiry would take 12 years or cost almost £200 million. Our views on that are well documented. It is right to pursue the truth with vigour and thoroughness, but let me reassure the House that there will be no more open-ended and costly inquiries into the past.
However, today is not about the controversies surrounding the process. It is about the substance, about what this report tells us. Everyone should have the chance to examine its complete findings, and that is why it is being published in full. Running to more than 5,000 pages, it is being published in 10 volumes. Naturally, it will take all of us some time to digest the report’s full findings and understand all the implications. The House will have an opportunity for a full day’s debate this autumn, and in the meantime the Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and for Defence will report back to me on all the issues that arise from it.
This report and the inquiry itself demonstrate how a state should hold itself to account and how we should be determined at all times—no matter how difficult—to judge ourselves against the highest standards. Openness and frankness about the past, however painful, do not make us weaker; they make us stronger. That is one of the things that differentiates us from the terrorists. We should never forget that over 3,500 people, from every community, lost their lives in Northern Ireland, the overwhelming majority killed by terrorists. There were many terrible atrocities.
Politically motivated violence was never justified, whichever side it came from, and it ​can never be justified by those criminal gangs that today want to drag Northern Ireland back to its bitter and bloody past. No Government I lead will ever put those who fight to defend democracy on an equal footing with those who continue to seek to destroy it, but nor will we hide from the truth that confronts us today. In the words of Lord Saville:
“What happened on Bloody Sunday strengthened the Provisional IRA, increased nationalist resentment and hostility towards the Army and exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed. Bloody Sunday was a tragedy for the bereaved and the wounded, and a catastrophe for the people of Northern Ireland.”
Those are words we cannot and must not ignore, but I hope what this report can do is mark the moment when we come together, in this House and in the communities we represent; come together to acknowledge our shared history, even where it divides us; and come together to close this painful chapter on Northern Ireland’s troubled past. That is not to say that we must ever forget or dismiss that past, but we must also move on. Northern Ireland has been transformed over the past 20 years and all of us in Westminster and Stormont must continue that work of change, coming together with all the people of Northern Ireland, to build a stable, peaceful, prosperous and shared future. It is with that determination that I commend this statement to the House.

Barack Obama,"Good afternoon, everybody.
Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people, regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the sun would come up in the morning. 
Now, it is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences. But remember, eight years ago President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences. But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running.
And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us. So I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the President-elect -- because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.
I also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton and I just had a chance to hear her remarks. I could not be prouder of her. She has lived an extraordinary life of public service. She was a great First Lady. She was an outstanding senator for the state of New York. And she could not have been a better secretary of state.
I'm proud of her. A lot of Americans look up to her. Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics. And I'm absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world.
Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team. This is an ""intramural scrimmage."" We're not Democrats first. We're not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We're patriots first. 
We all what -- want what's best for this country. That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And I was heartened by that. That's what the country needs -- a sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and a respect for each other.I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition. And I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin.
I also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done, day in, day out, often without a lot of fanfare, often with a lot of -- a lot of attention -- work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make government run better, and make it more responsive, and make it more efficient, and make it more service-friendly so that it's actually helping more people. That remarkable work has left the next President with a stronger, better country than the one that existed eight years ago.
So this was a long and hard fought campaign. A lot of our fellow Americans are exalted today; a lot of Americans are less so, but that's the nature of campaigns. That's the nature of democracy. It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy and it's not always inspiring. 
But to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged. Don't get cynical. Don't ever think you can't make a difference. As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it. Sometimes you lose an argument; sometimes you lose an election. 
You know, the path that this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag and sometimes, you know, we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back, and that's okay. I've lost elections before. Joe hasn't, but, you know -- So I've been -- I've been sort of sharing --
The point, though, is is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy. That's how this country has moved forward for 240 years. It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world. That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens. It's how we have come this far.
And that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on, as Americans, will go on. And I'm looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next President is successful in that.
I've said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner. You take the baton. You run your best race. And hopefully by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead; you've made a little progress. And I can say that we've done that, and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team. 
All right? Thank you very much, everybody.
"
George Osborne,"Good morning everyone, and on behalf of myself, David and Alan I want to welcome you all to the Treasury.
And can I take this opportunity to say how glad I am that I have someone of David’s intelligence and calibre to assist me in the work that we have to do.
We are here to talk about the very first item on the first page of the coalition agreement.
As it says, “Deficit reduction and continuing to ensure economic recovery is the most urgent issue facing Britain.”
We understand that.
And we need to get moving.
So today, less than a week after taking office, I want to explain some of the early arrangements for dealing with the fiscal crisis left by the last Government.
First, let me just tell you some of the stark facts.
Last year our budget deficit was the largest it has ever been in our peacetime history.
This year it is set to be among the largest the world.
According to the IMF and the European Commission, it will be the largest in the G7 and the largest in the European Union.
This is the legacy of thirteen years of fiscal irresponsibility.
And it poses a very real threat to the recovery.
That it is why this new coalition is founded on an agreement to significantly accelerate the reduction in the deficit, starting this year.
This is not about party interests, it is about the national interest.
The advice that we have received from the Treasury and the Bank of England make that clear.
Those who argue that action can be safely delayed for another eleven months would put our economy at risk for the sake of short term political advantage.
The last few weeks have shown quite how urgent the necessary action has become.
Greece is a reminder of what happens when governments lack the willingness to act decisively and quickly, and when problems are swept under the carpet.
The result is sharp increases in interest rates, worsening recession, growing unemployment.
At one point, interest rates in Greece increased by a full 10 percentage points.
The dangers were clear when I spoke to finance ministers from around the world on Friday.
The European package that was agreed last weekend has solved the immediate liquidity crisis, but it has not solved the underlying solvency crisis.
The threat has not gone away.
And I know people everywhere are worried about what this means for them.
They are asking themselves – will I be affected?
What does this mean for my job, my family, my children’s future?
To them I say – if we fail to tackle the deficit we inherited from the previous government, the consequences could be disastrous.
If we don’t get on top of our debt, every family in Britain will be poorer and the dreams of millions of young people will be dashed.
Mortgages will be higher, businesses will go bust and debt interest will become one of the largest items of government spending.
We urgently need to restore confidence in our economy.
And we need the determination to act quickly in the short-term in order to establish credibility for the longer term.
So what will we do?
The first part of our approach is to boost credibility and confidence in the UK’s fiscal framework.
In short, we urgently need a full, independent assessment of how bad the problem really is.
As the IMF has said “strong fiscal institutions can enhance the credibility of consolidation plans”.
I could not agree more.
Over the last 13 years the public and the markets have completely lost confidence in government economic forecasts.
The last government’s forecasts for growth in the economy, over the past ten years, have on average been out by £13bn.
Their forecasts of the budget deficit three years ahead have on average been out by £40bn.
Unsurprisingly, these forecasting errors have almost always been in the wrong direction.
The conclusion is clear.
We need long-lasting change in the way we put together budgets in this country.
The final decision on the forecast has always been made by the Chancellor, not independent officials.
And that is precisely the problem.
Again and again, the temptation to fiddle the figures, to nudge up a growth forecast here or reduce a borrowing number there to make the numbers add up has proved too great.
And that is a significant part of the reason for our current problems.
I believe the public should be able to trust official forecasts for the economy.
I want independent forecasts to become the norm.
And this will inevitably mean giving away some of my powers as Chancellor.
Of course, the elected government will still set the overall fiscal goals of the government, and the extent to which fiscal policy expands or contracts at each budget.
And of course, it will also retain control over tax and spending decisions.
These are properly decisions for elected politicians, accountable to Parliament and to voters.
But I am the first Chancellor to remove the temptation to fiddle the figures by giving up control over the economic and fiscal forecast.
I recognise that this will create a rod for my back down the line, and for the backs of future chancellors.
That is the whole point.
We need to fix the budget to fit the figures, not fix the figures to fit the budget.
To do this, I am today establishing a new independent Office for Budget Responsibility.
For the first time we will have a truly independent assessment of the state of the nation’s finances.
So they can get to work immediately, the OBR will initially operate on a non-statutory basis, just as the Monetary Policy Committee operated before it was enshrined in legislation.
It will be headed by Sir Alan Budd, one of the most respected fiscal and macroeconomic experts in our country.
He is a man of immense integrity and indisputable independence, having worked for governments of both right and left, and he was appointed as an inaugural member of the Monetary Policy Committee by Gordon Brown.
I am very glad that he is here with us today.
He will be joined by two other independent experts, Geoffrey Dicks and Graham Parker, and together they will form the Budget Responsibility Committee.
With help from a secretariat of civil servants, they will be in charge of making independent forecasts for the economy and the public finances.
They will have direct control over that forecast.
They will make all the key judgements.
And they will produce the fiscal numbers that underpin government policy in the Budget Red Book.
But I don’t think we can afford to wait until the Budget for an independent assessment of the true state of the public finances.
So the first of the OBR’s forecasts will be produced ahead of the emergency Budget.
Everyone will be able to see the scale of the problem to which that Budget must provide the solution.
I have asked the Treasury to give Alan and the Committee full access to all the data, assumptions, and economic models.
Because they will also have a role, over the coming months, in exposing all the hidden liabilities and long-term pressures facing us as a country.
Looking at the cost of our ageing society, public service pensions, or the cost of outstanding PFI contracts, for example.
For the first time we will have an independently audited and transparent national balance sheet.
In due course, the OBR will be put on a statutory footing, with legislation in the Queen’s Speech next week.
And at the Budget I will announce the overall path we intend to pursue for the public finances, and against which the OBR will judge the government’s fiscal policy.
For each Budget and Pre-Budget Report they will confirm whether the Government’s policy is consistent with a better than 50 per cent chance of achieving that objective.
That means there will be nowhere to hide the debts, no way to fiddle the figures, and no way of avoiding the difficult choices that have been put off for too long.
With all these changes, fiscal policy in this country will be at the cutting edge of international best practice.
Making us one of the few advanced economies with an independent fiscal agency that produces official fiscal and economic forecasts.
Given that many countries face similar fiscal challenges – though few on a similar scale – I hope that the world will look with interest at our policy innovations.
So the first part of our approach is a truly independent audit of the public finances.
But it is not enough just to know the scale of the problem.
We need to show that we have the determination to fix it, and that means making a start this year.
The coalition has agreed that £6bn of savings to non-front line public services should be made this financial year.
The departments for health, defence and international development will also make savings but they will be reinvested in their front lines.
The coalition has also agreed that, given the state of the public finances, the great majority of the £6bn of savings from other departments will be used to reduce the deficit.
Some proportion will be used to support jobs in a targeted and effective way, as set out in the coalition agreement, for example through the cancelling of some backdated demands for business rates.
It is the clear view of the Treasury and the Governor of the Bank of England that these are the necessary actions to ensure economic stability and secure the recovery.
The Treasury’s assessment is that there is a strong economic case for an immediate spending reduction of £6bn.
The Governor, when presenting his inflation report last week, said it was right for a new government “to put into place a serious plan to tackle the fiscal deficit… and to make clear it was serious about it by doing some measures this year.”
He added that he did not “think £6bn of cuts will dramatically change the outlook for growth this year, and it does reduce some of the downside risks”.
So we are in no doubt that this action is advisable.
And the work that David Laws and I have already done in the Treasury has convinced us that it is also achievable without affecting the quality of key public services.
By tackling wasteful spending now, rather than later, we can demonstrate our commitment to tackle the deficit.
We can help the independent central bank keep interest rates lower for longer.
And we can begin to turn the tide of debt that is threatening our economy.
David will, in a moment, take you through this in more detail.
But let me briefly explain how the process will work.
The specific allocations of in-year savings will be announced a week today.
These will include significant reductions to the cost of quangos.
This is unprecedented speed for a spending round, but we need to get moving, and every day comes at the cost of more wasteful spending.
The emergency Budget will then set out the fiscal path and the spending totals needed to achieve it over the coming years, underpinned by the OBR’s independent forecasts.
The Budget will also contain measures to boost enterprise, create a fairer tax system, and demonstrate to the world that Britain is open for business.
I will be saying more about this when I speak to the CBI Annual Dinner on Wednesday.
The Spending Review will then report in the Autumn, informed by the Strategic Defence Review.
So, in the space of less than a week this new coalition government has already:
– changed the way that Budgets are made, forever;
– created a new independent office that will restore confidence in the numbers that underpin the budget;
– set in train the creation of the first independently audited national balance sheet;
– confirmed immediate action to identify £6 billion of wasteful spending this year, while protecting the most vulnerable in our society and the quality of front line services on which people depend;
– and set out the steps towards an emergency Budget that will show that Britain can live within its means and will provide the solid foundation for a private sector recovery
That is the route to a stable, balanced economy that works for everyone.
Finally, the coalition agreement states that the emergency Budget will be within 50 days of the signing of the agreement.
Some have said that is a tight timescale.
But I believe that we need to act even sooner to restore confidence in our economy.
So the Budget date will be Tuesday 22nd of June.
Exactly six weeks, or 42 days, from the signing of the coalition agreement.
Thank you.
"
Tony Blair,"When I was Prime Minister I was known as an optimist. I still am. I’m optimistic about Britain, its future and the opportunities the world holds for us. Provided we take the right decisions, imbued with the right attitude of mind.
Strange as it might seem, the financial crisis does not diminish this optimism. The way we are coming through the crisis instead reinforces it. We are not out of the woods yet; but we are on the path out.
This did not happen by chance; but by choice. Think back 18 months, think back to the collapse of September 2008, and where the world was. It was poised on the brink of catastrophe. The prediction indeed of many – economists, commentators, even at least in private, leaders, was that we were doomed to repeat the collapse of the 1930’s. The spectre of prolonged recession stalked the corridors of economic and political power.
Britain, like all other major nations, was hit hard by the crisis. In a deluge such as this, no one escapes. But now, March 2010, Britain has just had a Budget signalling a return to growth, a slow, difficult recovery, but a recovery nonetheless. The world economy is now similarly poised: not for catastrophe but for recuperation. It will mean here and elsewhere adjustments, tough action on deficits, changes in the way both public and private sectors work. All round the globe, in Cabinets, in boardrooms, at work places such a debate is happening about how best to proceed. We cannot understate the pain some people have gone through as a consequence of the global crisis or the insecurity they now face. For many young people and equally young families or people whose livelihoods have been badly hit, the anxiety has not abated, it continues. What we can say is compared to the fear of what might have been, we have emerged better than virtually any predicted. Hard decisions l ie ahead undoubtedly. But though the sea is still rough, the storm has subsided.
This is for a simple reason, both in respect of Britain and of the world. The right decisions at the outset of the crisis were taken. Governments were mobilised, the financial sector put on emergency support, demand stimulated and most of all, there was an immediate recognition that decisive action was necessary and urgent. At the moment of peril the world acted. Britain acted. The decision to act, required experience, judgement and boldness. It required leadership. Gordon Brown supplied it.
Since then, Gordon and Alistair Darling have been striving to keep the country moving, capable of meeting not just future challenges, but seizing future opportunities.
The issue for the future is very clear: how does Britain emerge from the financial crisis; how do we compete in the new markets; how do we re-energise our dynamism, enterprise and sense of possibility?
This is not just about policy, but about mindset. Who “gets” the future? That’s always the political question. Who understands the way the world is changing and can be comfortable in it? Who sees the excitement where others see the fear?
The New Industries, New Jobs paper from Peter Mandelson, for me, correctly identifies both challenge and opportunity. It is the right judicious mix of Government and market, reserving for the first the role only it can play, and giving the second the help it needs to prosper. It represents a vision of how Britain can do well and how individuals and families can do better. It’s a platform for the hope of prosperity to come.
So now our country has to debate the direction for our future. It’s a big thing for Labour to win a 4th term. Remember prior to 1997 Labour had never won two successive full terms. Now we have won three. So it’s a big moment for the Party; but of course, most of all, it is a momentous decision for the country.
The tough thing about being in government, especially as time marches on, is that the disappointments accumulate, the public becomes less inclined to give the benefit of the doubt, the call for a time to change becomes easier to make, prospect of change becomes more attractive. But as I always used to say when some in our ranks urged a mantra of “time for a change” in 1997, it is the most vacuous slogan in politics.
“Time for a Change” begs the question: change to what exactly? And the reason an election that seemed certain to some in its outcome, is now in sharp contention, lies precisely in that question.
As the issue has ceased to be “what makes me angry about the government”, and has focused instead on “if I get change, what change exactly am I getting”, so the race has narrowed. Because that is not a question readily or coherently answered; and in so far as it can be answered, gives as much cause for anxiety as for reassurance.
On some issues like racial equality the Conservatives have left behind the prejudices of the past. I welcome that.
But when it comes to the big policy issues, there is a puzzle, that has turned into a problem that has now become a long hard pause for thought: Where are they centred?
Is there a core? Think of all the phrases you associate with their leadership and the phrase “you know where you are with them” is about the last description you would think of. They seem like they haven’t made up their mind about where they stand; and so the British public finds it hard to make up its mind about where it stands. In uncertain times, there is a lot to be said for certain leadership.
What happens after a long period of one party in Government, is this: the flipside of change being attractive, is that the public put a question mark over the Party seeking to be the change. It is not a cynical question mark. It is not loaded. It’s just a simple inquiry: what is it that I am getting?
Prior to 1997, Gordon and I were acutely conscious of this. We sought to answer the question by saying, again, then again, then further again, that we were a new and different progressive force, that we would combine ambition and compassion, that we understood why Labour had been rejected and we had learnt. Even when we were 20 points ahead in the polls and some of my colleagues would say “oh come on, Tony, ease off now” I would say: no it is at the very moment when we are ahead, that we reinforce and repeat the message that our agenda is different from the past and we reassert New Labour.
However, more than that, we had worked out a set of positions – not always defined policy but positions – that were clear and mutually coherent. We advocated a New Labour policy on the economy and also on law and order; we aimed to be as forward-looking on defence as on public services. We were New Labour throughout. It was a philosophical concept woven across the whole fabric of the case we were putting to the people. We re-wrote the Party constitution; changed policy on education, Northern Ireland, trade union law, crime. There was no compromise with the essential manifesto of New Labour. This was for a straightforward reason: we believed in it. We wanted to define not only our case for government but the way we would govern.
So over time, the question mark faded and was answered. The question mark over the Tories has gone into bolder print. It has grown not faded. They look like they’re either the old Tory Party, but want to hide it; or they’re not certain which way to go. But either is not good news.
On Europe, they’ve gone right when they should have gone centre. On law and order, they’ve gone liberal when actually they should have stuck with a traditional Conservative position; and on the economy, they seem to be buffeted this way and that, depending less on where they think the country should be, than on where they think public opinion might be.
The Europe policy is really not trivial. It is bad enough to end up trying to form an alternative far right group to the mainstream Conservatives like Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. That really isn’t smart. Of course those leaders will work with whichever Party is elected; but forfeiting goodwill in such a spectacular fashion won’t be a great beginning. Withdrawing from the Social Chapter will expend vast amounts of political energy and capital. It is a truly regressive step and for what? The feeling I get is that this is all a sop to the Tory Party. But that’s worrying at two levels. The issue is too important to be a sop, so that’s not good judgement and if it is a sop, what does that say about the Tory Party? Either way, Britain will pay the price, as it did before 1997. And by the way, no Party has won an election in Britain on an avowedly anti Europe platform since we joined the Common Market in the 1970’s.
On law and order the Tories have opposed the stronger anti-terrorism measures and much of the anti-social behaviour agenda. They even want to restrict the use of the DNA database. This employs the advanced technology of DNA tracking and matching, to provide incontrovertible evidence of guilt or innocence. Its use so far has resulted in extraordinary breakthroughs. Old crimes, whose victims or their families never received justice, can be solved and perpetrators brought to book. Innocent people have been freed. As the database builds up, it becomes an invaluable crime fighting tool. In time, it will also be a fierce deterrent, since criminals particularly murderers, rapists and those who commit violent assault, will know they run a big risk of detection. It is an absolutely sensible use of modern technology. It can actually help prevent abuses of civil liberties. Yet the Tories oppose it.
Everywhere you look, where you want certainty, you get confusion.
So the Conservative leader speaking about his policy on the NHS a few weeks back spoke of his pride at how his party members “wrote out the placards, marched on the streets, campaigned to save our community hospitals, our maternity units, our GP’s surgeries.” Well, ok. That’s a policy of preserving the status quo in the NHS.
But here’s Oliver Letwin, now Shadow Cabinet member in charge of policy for a Conservative Government speaking yesterday in the Wall Street Journal: He talks of bringing transformational free-market principles to public services and says: “We will implement a very systematic and powerful change agenda where hospitals compete for patients, schools compete for pupils, welfare providers compete for results…”
That’s also clear. That’s a policy of radical transformation of the status quo.
Or on economic policy, one week the absolute priority is deficit reduction. Ok, again clear. But yesterday a big tax cut became the centrepiece and not a vague ‘when things are better’ aspiration; but a full-on pledge.
Leave aside for a minute, the rights and wrongs of the policies. What can’t be left aside is that they are plainly diametrically opposite. So why the confusion?
The benign but still disqualifying explanation is that the policy-makers are confused, not just the policies. The less benign one is that one set of policies represents what they believe in; the other what they think they have to say to win. That’s not a confusion, actually; that’s a strategy and the British people deserve to have that strategy exposed before polling day.
By contrast, Labour has chosen its path. It is mapped out. It is consistent. It is solid. It matches a strong commitment to public services with a strong commitment to reform. It is clear on crime. The economic policy is measured and set out by the steady hand of Alistair Darling. The package is coherent and thought through.
It does two other things that are defining. It acknowledges completely that difficult choices lie ahead. But it seeks to do them fairly, to balance the tough medicine with the compassion. There are policies to cut the deficit but also to help the unemployed, to protect pensioners from poverty, to ensure that opportunity is spread as widely as possible and today a new plan to provide a National Care Service. It seeks to keep Britain together as a nation through troubled times.
But it does something else. It recognises that we must make these choices and map out our path in a world whose challenges are increasingly global and whose solutions therefore must be. It is outward not inward looking.
Thirteen years of power has seen its share of bad times and good, for the people and for the government. That’s for sure.
But just cast our mind back and recall the change for the better. Not just the pledges on the famous pledge card back in 1997, every one met and more.
Remember how people used to wait 18 months queuing on a hospital waiting list. Now it is a maximum wait of 18 weeks from GP to operation. Delivered by a Labour Government.
Thousands fewer deaths from heart disease and cancer. Delivered by a Labour Government.
In 1997 half of all schools got fewer than 30% of their pupils 5 good GCSEs. Today it is only 1 in 12. Delivered by a Labour Government.
And the biggest schools and hospitals re-building programme since the Welfare State began. Delivered by a Labour Government.
New services like Sure Start.
New frontline workers.
Help for families through tax credits and the winter allowance.
Delivered by a Labour Government.
Crime down, having doubled in the 18 years of the last Tory Government, the chances of being a victim lower than at any time since the Crime Survey began.
Delivered by a Labour Government.
Then the changes that we delivered and that would never have happened under the Tories: a minimum wage, flexible working, devolution, a ban on handguns. And how do we know they wouldn’t have happened under the Tories? Because in each case they opposed the change.
Then there are the things done which define the spirit of the society we believe in: civil partnerships, the Human Rights Act, the boost for arts and culture and yes even bringing the Olympics to Britain in 2012.
This has been part of a global vision. One of my charities today works in Africa. We have teams in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Liberia. In each country, Britain’s role is celebrated as a leader in the fight against global poverty. We can be proud of what we done in development. Our troops continue to perform heroically and brilliantly in Afghanistan. And just recently in Basra, we have seen the huge change in the local economy, due in part to the way British troops held the line there through the most fraught times and of course the Iraq election. In Europe, Britain is standing up for our interests but reckoned and respected as a sound partner for Europe’s other nations. When Gordon sought to bring the world together to act in the financial crisis, it came naturally. He understands it.
Which leads me back to the central point of the election: who “gets” the future? This is not a matter of age or personality. It is a matter of comprehension. This is a very, very important moment in which to exercise understanding. Since leaving office, and spending much time abroad, I can tell you one thing above all else. The characteristics of today’s world are: it is interdependent; it is changing; and power is moving East. And all of this is happening fast, faster than we can easily imagine. Britain’s challenge is not a 20th Century one and its politics cannot afford 20th Century political attitudes. The country has to go forward with energy, drive, determination and above all understanding. Closed minds close off the future. That would mean the challenge is failed, but it would also mean the opportunity is squandered.
This country faces big challenges in the futures.
I want this party to be the one able to meet those challenges.
This country needs strong leadership.
I want our leadership to be the one that gives it.
There is still vast potential and promise in our nation.
I want our government to be the one that develops it.
I want a future fair for all.
I believe a 4th term Labour Government can deliver it.
"
Barack Obama,"I would just like to say that there have been those who have been saying that there is tension between the United States and the National League for Democracy -- or perhaps with me. I would like to make quite clear that the friendship between the United States and those who have been struggling for democracy in Burma is a very strong one. We may view things differently from time to time but it will in no way affect our friendship.
And I have absolute confidence that the United States will continue to support us with regard to the democratic transformation and that when Burma becomes a fully functioning democracy in accordance with the will of the people, we will be able to say that among those friends who enabled us to get there, the United States was among the first.
So please don't think -- please don't worry that there will be any problems between the United States and those working for democracy in Burma. We all believe in the same values. We all believe in the same principles. We may sometimes think that there are different ways of getting to the goal that we wish to achieve, but these differences are part of the democratic tradition. Democracy allows people to have different views, and democracy makes it also -- makes us also responsible for negotiating an answer to those views.
I would like all of you to feel welcome in this country, and I would all -- like all of you to feel that you can join us in hoping for better days. But at the same time, I always warn against over-optimism because that could lead to complacency.
Our reform process is going through, let’s us say, a bumpy...patch. But this bumpy patch is something that we can negotiate with commitment and with the help and understanding of our friends from all over the world. So let us not exaggerate the differences, the difficulties. But at the same time, let us not exaggerate the rosy picture either.
What we need is a healthy balance between optimism and pessimism. We need to view the -- the situation for what it was. But at the same time, we all have to be confident that we will get there -- we will get where we want to get to, because that’s what our people want. In the end, it’s the people of Burma who will decide where this country is going to and which way and how and when.
So we accept responsibility for the fate of our country, but at the same time we welcome the support and the help of our friends. And we always appreciate them very greatly.
Thank you.
When I made my first historic visit to Burma, this country was just taking preliminary steps towards democracy. And in the past two years, important changes have been made. The economy has begun to grow. Political prisoners have been set free. There are more newspapers and media outlets. Children have been released from the military. And these are all important changes that have opened up greater opportunity for the people of Burma.
At the same time, as Aung San Suu Kyi just said, it’s clear how much hard work remains to be done and that many difficult choices still lie ahead. The process for reform is by no means complete or irreversible. For many, progress has not come fast enough or spread far enough. People need to feel safe in their homes and not be subject to arbitrary harassment by authorities or individuals acting with impunity. People need to be empowered to pursue their dreams. And as Burma approaches important national elections next year, it will be critical to ensure that all of Burma’s people can participate in shaping the future of their country.
As a member of parliament and the head of the rule of law committee, Aung San Suu Kyi is working hard to make government more transparent, more accountable, to protect the rights of all the Burmese people, to promote reforms that would expand the political space for more people to contribute their voices. But implementing the major political and economic reforms that are necessary to keep Burma advancing toward democracy is going to take a great deal of political will and no small amount of determination. And we, as friends of the Burmese people, are clear-eyed about the scale of the challenges that remain, and recognize that we cannot remain complacent.
Today, Daw Suu and I had a wide-ranging discussion about how the United States can help facilitate and bolster Burma’s democratic transition. We talked about the need for stronger rule of law, for elections that are free, fair and inclusive, and for continued constitutional changes that will move Burma more fully towards a civilian government.
We spoke about how we can work together to promote national reconciliation and defuse sectarian tensions among Burma’s diverse ethnic groups. Specifically, I stressed the need to find durable and effective solutions for the terrible violence in Rakhine state -- solutions that end discrimination, provide greater security and economic opportunities, protect all citizens, and promote greater tolerance and understanding. Strengthening human rights protections for all of Burma’s people is an essential step to realizing the vision we share for the future of this beautiful country.
The last time I stood here, I made a pledge to the people of Burma -- that if we continued to see progress toward reform, the ties between our countries would grow stronger, and the United States would continue to do whatever it could to help ensure Burma’s success. Over the last two years, I think we’ve made good on that pledge, and I want to reiterate the commitment to match continued reforms with greater support and friendships in the future.
We’re committed to working directly with the people of Burma, and not just the government. So later today, I’m looking forward to speaking with representatives of Burma’s civil society groups and with young leaders from Burma and all across Southeast Asia who are working to create greater opportunities for themselves and for future generations. I think these new voices are going to be critical to making sure that reforms are sustainable and meaningful to people across the country and across the region.
So, Daw Suu, thank you again for welcoming us here today. We continue to look to you for inspiration as well as resolve, and I know that you will continue to be a fierce advocate on behalf of the people of Burma, a future of democracy, and I know that you will be a strong partner with the United States.
Thank you. Questions?
Who’s speaking?
I’ll go first. Christi Parsons.
And if I may, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, ask you -- how concerned are you about the violence against ethnic minorities in your country, and specifically the Rohingya people? And what do you believe is your responsibility to speak out about it? Thank you very much.
The issue of press freedom is a constant concern in my interactions with the Chinese government. It’s an issue that I’ve raised with the President here in Burma. I’m pretty blunt and pretty frank about the fact that societies that repress journalists ultimately oppress people as well, and that if you want a society that is free and vibrant and successful, part of that formula is the free flow of information, of ideas, and that requires a free press. That is part of our tradition.
As I explained to President Xi in China, it’s in our DNA. We believe in the primacy individuals being able to pursue their dreams, endowed with certain inalienable rights. And we believe that when governments censor or control information, that ultimately that undermines not only the society, but it leads to eventual encroachments on individual rights as well.
I can't comment, Christi, on any particular pending case, as you know -- that's sort of an iron-clad rule -- or any particular prosecution. I can read back to you what Attorney General Holder has said, which is no journalist is going to go to jail for doing their job. And I don't think you're suggesting that there's -- that the two cases are comparable. But I recognize that in our own society we have to constantly balance the need for certain national security issues to remain secret with journalists pursuing leads wherever they can.
And the good news is, is that we've got courts and we've got a First Amendment. And we got a whole bunch of tools to ensure that that balance is properly debated and adjudicated.
But I think that when I am traveling, it is important as the President of the United States to not just talk about our interests, but also to talk about our values. Sometimes it has an impact; sometimes it doesn't. Although I was impressed that Mark Landler got an answer to his question from President Xi. It might not have been the one he was expecting, but he did end up taking the question. So you just keep on chipping away and seeing if we can make progress.
Hold on a second, Christi. Don't try to segue into a second question.
I think I better take over because I've got to have my time as well.
There you go.
The National League for Democracy always has been against violence of any kind, either on racial grounds, or religious grounds, or ideological grounds. We do not believe that violence really resolves anything at all.
Our struggle for democracy has been carried out with a strong grasp on the principle of nonviolence. And also, we believe in the rule of law. So if you ask how do we propose to resolve all of these problems of violence between communities, between different ethnic groups, we've got to start with rule of law. People have to feel secure before they can start talking to one another. We cannot achieve harmony without security. People who feel threatened are not going to sit down and sort out their problems.
So I would like to recommend, as the chair of the Rule of Law and Tranquility Committee -- don't forget that tranquility is also included -- that the government should look to rule of law. It is the duty of the government to make all our people feel secure, and it is the duty of our people to learn to live in harmony with one another.
If we want democracy, we have to be prepared to live by the principles of democracy. We have to dare to live according to the principles of democracy. I think we'll get there, but it will take us some time. But we will remain fully committed to the principle of nonviolence.
And also to Daw Aung San Sui Kyi, you have got a one-hour discussion with the President, and at the current political situation, as you said, it’s a bumpy situation. So if you didn't make amendment, or you didn't change constitution, the NLD and you, yourself, is going to be very difficult after 2015 elections. So have you talked about those issues with the President? Or the President talk to you about U.S. support for you? Thank you.
Well, the issue of making sure that reforms and the transition is fully realized was the main topic of our conversation and the main topic of my conversation with the President last night.
As I indicated before, there are signs of progress. We shouldn't deny that Burma today is not the same as Burma five years ago. But the process is still incomplete. And I was very specific with the President in terms of how we will measure whether or not the transition has been fully realized.
Number one, we expect elections to take place on time. We do not want to see delays, because it's time for the voice of the people of Burma to be heard in a fair, free, transparent election.
Number two, I indicated to the President that the constitution amendment process needs to reflect inclusion rather than exclusion, that there are certain provisions in the Burmese constitution that objectively don't make much sense. Ultimately, what changes are made are up to the people of Burma. But, for example, I don't understand a provision that would bar somebody from running for President because of who their children are. That doesn't make much sense to me.
Number three, we are very much in favor of the peace process, and I encourage the President to move forward in the negotiations. He expressed some optimism about the ability to bring a deal to a conclusion. But as Daw Suu has indicated, you have to be skeptical until it's actually done.
Number four, I indicated that we are paying attention to how religious minorities are treated in this country. Now, I recognize the complexities of the situation in Rakhine state. On the other hand, consistent with what Daw Suu just said, I am a firm believer that any legitimate government has to be based on rule of law and a recognition that all people are equal under the law. And discrimination against the Rohingya or any other religious minority I think does not express the kind of country that Burma over the long term wants to be. And I know of no successful democracy in which sectarian or religious divisions are allowed to fester, or the people of different faiths are treated as second-class citizens. Ultimately, that is destabilizing to a democracy.
And finally, I expressed to the President the need to continue to make additional progress on basic issues of freedom and personal security, that journalists can't be jailed simply because they were critical of the government; that arbitrary arrests or individuals being in some fashion abused by government with impunity rather than being respected and treated in accordance with law, that that's a test of whether or not a society is moving towards a genuine democratic process.
And the President yesterday acknowledged that some progress has been made, and there was more to do. And our position will be to continue to measure what's happening on the ground, to consult with a wide range of groups here in Burma. We will strengthen our relationship where we see progress. Where we don’t see progress, then we will continue to express our concerns, and we will not be able to fully realize the kind of bilateral relationship that we want to have with Burma, the Burmese government, until we’ve seen some of these reforms completed.
Well, you asked whether it's going to be fruitful for the NLD to win the elections if the amendments to the constitution are not pushed through. I think it’s too early to ask this question. We’ve just spent one afternoon debating the question of constitutional amendment. I think perhaps some of you may have heard that proportional representation is not going to be instituted.
. It’s not a matter of wanting to win a case, it’s a matter of standing up for what you believe in, for what you believe is necessary for the future of our country.
Now we are asking for a constitutional amendment not because we’re trying to win a case, but because we think that certain amendments are necessary if this country is to be a truly functioning democracy in line with the will of the people. Because of that, we will persist in our efforts to have the constitution amended in the right way and within the framework of the law. I’ve always put great emphasis on this because I want peace and tranquility in our country. I want our people to learn to live under the rule of law, and to support and uphold the importance of the rule of law.
So with regard to the constitution, we know that the people support our wish to amend it in certain ways, and we are prepared to negotiate with those who do not wish to amend the constitution. I think that’s what democracy is all about. We need a culture of negotiated compromise as the foundation for our democratic union.
So we would like to -- it’s not just a matter of debating the case in parliament and winning Brownie points or Boy Scout points, or whatever they’re called. But it’s just a case of standing up for what we think our country needs. And we would like to talk to those who disagree with us. That, again, is what democracy is about. You talk to those who disagree with you; you don’t beat them down. You exchange views. And you come to a compromise, a settlement that would be best for the country.
I’ve always said that dialogues and debates are not aimed at achieving victory for one particular party or the other, but victory for our people as a whole. Whatever we decide on should be seen as a victory for our nation, for the kind of democratic union that we have been trying to build up for decades.
So please don’t worry about whether or not we will win the elections in 2015. Of course, any party wants to win the elections. I’m sure the President will tell you that. But winning is not everything -- it’s how you win. I’d rather lose than win in the wrong way. And that is the way I want our party and our people to approach the problems that we have to tackle -- that we want to win in the right way. We want to bring the changes of the constitution about in the right way.
We want to build up a strong foundation for national reconciliation, which means reconciliation not just between the different ethnic groups and between different religious groups, but between different ideas -- for example, between the idea of military supremacy and the idea of civilian authority over the military, which is the foundation of democracy.
So we want to exchange views and to come to an understanding with all those who at this moment do not yet agree with us. And we are confident that we can come to such a settlement, come to such an agreement because, after all, I do believe that what all of us want is what is best for the country as a whole -- not just for particular individuals or groups or organizations.
So while I tell you that you need not worry about what affects amendment or non-amendment to the constitution might have on the elections, I might as well ask you to vote for us when we do get there.
Pete Maer.
And on two other issues, I’m wondering what your take is on the plan to pass a bill to build the Keystone pipeline that’s in the works now, before the State Department’s review process is over. And Senator McConnell is angry over the climate deal that you had made with China. How does all of this square with your post-election assessment that people want to, as you put it, get stuff done?
And if I may also pose a question to you, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Thank you for hosting all of us here from the White House media corps. As the President mentioned of the constitutional barring of you running in your country’s election, what do you think the impact will be from the President’s statement that was made here today on his strong opposition to that constitutional wording? And what impact do you think it will have on the government here? And is there anything more that you’d like to see him do? Thank you.
Pete, the day after the election I said that there are going to be areas of agreement between me and Republicans, and there are going to be areas of disagreement. There are going to be actions I take they don’t like, and there are going to be bills they pass that I don’t like.
And I think, moving forward, that’s exactly what’s going to happen. You’ve mentioned areas where we disagree. I believe that America is a nation of immigrants. Everybody agrees that the system is broken. There has been ample opportunity for Congress to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would strengthen our borders, improve the legal immigration system, lift millions of people out of the shadows so they are paying taxes and getting right by the law. It passed out of the Senate. I gave the House over a year to go ahead and at least give a vote to the Senate bilaterally; they failed to do so. And I indicated to Speaker Boehner several months ago that if, in fact, Congress failed to act, I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better. And that’s going to happen. That’s going to happen before the end of the year.
But what I’ve also said to them -- and I said this during the lunch with the Speaker and Leader McConnell -- is that I am always interested in negotiating a legislative solution to the immigration problem, and that the minute they pass a bill that I can sign that fixes our immigration system, then any executive actions I take are replaced.
So they have the ability to fix the system. What they don’t have the ability to do is to expect me to stand by with a broken system in perpetuity. And I would advise that if, in fact, they want to take a different approach, rather than devote a lot of time trying to constrain my lawful actions as the Chief Executive of the U.S. government in charge of our enforcing our immigration laws, that they spend some time passing a bill and engaging with all the stakeholders, the immigrant rights groups, the law enforcement groups, the evangelicals, the business community, all of whom have said this is something that needs to be done, is way overdue. And we’ve been talking about it for 10 years now, and it’s been consistently stalled.
So with respect to Keystone, I’ve been clear in the past, Pete, my position hasn’t changed, that this is a process that is supposed to be followed. Right now you have a case pending in Nebraska, where the pipeline would run through, in which a state court judge has questioned the plan. And until we know what the route is, it’s very hard to finish that evaluation. And I don’t think we should short-circuit that process.
I have also noted that, as policy matter, my government believes that we should judge this pipeline based on whether or not it accelerates climate change or whether it helps the American people with their energy costs and their gas prices. And I have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the Keystone pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the United States, or is somehow lowering gas prices.
Understand what this project is. It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices. You know what does have an impact on U.S. gas prices is the incredible boom in U.S. oil production and natural gas production that's taken place under my administration.
And if my Republican friends really want to focus on what's good for the American people in terms of job creation and lower energy costs, we should be engaging in a conversation about what are we doing to produce even more homegrown energy. I'm happy to have that conversation.
With respect to the climate change deal, I have been very clear that I have responsibilities as President not just to current generations, but to future generations. The science is indisputable. The planet is getting warm, and it is getting warmer in part because of man-made activity.
And the release of carbon gases -- carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere can have a potentially devastating effect that will cost our country, could devastate communities, could increase the impact of natural disasters, and will have an impact worldwide that is destabilizing and could affect our national security. That's not my opinion, by the way, that is the opinion of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, that climate change is a direct national security threat.
Now the argument that I've received in the past has been either denial of the science or, alternatively, there's no point in us doing something about it despite us being one of the two largest emitters in the world, because if we do something and China doesn't do anything, we'll just put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage, we'll lose jobs to China, and the problem won't be solved anyway.
I'm not going deny the science, but I took seriously the notion that we want all countries to participate in solving a global problem. And so I engaged with China over a lengthy set of negotiations. And by all independent accounts, for the first time, we got China to make a very serious commitment to constrain its greenhouse gases. Why would anybody be against that? That sounds like the right thing to do to me. So that's a response to those specific ideas.
But let me reiterate what I said at the top. The fact that I disagree or Republicans disagree with me on a certain set of issues doesn't exclude us working together on a whole range of issues where we do agree. They're interested in tax reform -- so am I. Let's get to work. They're interested in promoting trade that will create jobs and opportunity for U.S. workers and U.S. businesses -- all over it. It's part of what this Asia trip has been all about. They're interested in rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, putting people back to work, making sure we're competitive -- I'm game. So the one thing that I think is going to be important for us to have a successful partnership over the next couple of years is not making disagreements on a single issue suddenly a deal-breaker on every issue. Democracy can never work that way because there are always going to be some differences. And when there are differences you can't elevate those differences above the commonalities.
I'm sorry that was a long answer, but it was a lot of questions.
Do you want to --
I'm sorry the President can't get away from all those.
I know. But before Daw Suu responds to the point about the constitutional amendment, I just want to emphasize, ultimately it's up to the people of Burma to make a decision about all these provisions.
I expressed an objective view that some of current provisions don't seem to have much grounding in common sense or precedent when you look at other constitutions around the world, and seem more focused on advantaging or disadvantaging certain players. And one of the basic concepts of a constitution is that it creates a level playing field for all people, and then so I use that as an example not because I think my voice is the one that's most relevant in terms of the constitutional amendment process, but ultimately it's up to the people of Burma.
I did? It doesn't make much sense to me.
I believe democracy should stand up for that principle.
Absolutely.
Well, I've always said that it's somewhat flattering to have a constitution written with me in mind. But it shouldn't be done that way. That's not how a democratic constitution should be written. And we object to that clause not because -- not because it debars me from the presidency as such, but because it is against the principle of democracy and also unconstitutional. The constitution says that all citizens should be treated as equals, and this is discrimination on the grounds of my children, my children's spouses, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, this is not acceptable. And our people are firmly behind us in our desire to change this clause. And if President Obama said anything about the necessity to change a clause like that, they will love him very much for it. So he will be very popular among our people.
And as he said, in the end, it is up to our people to shape the destiny of our country, including the way the constitution is going to be rewritten.
And according to the law -- and I think the President will know the law better than I do because I'm not a lawyer -- according to the law, anybody who is over the age of 18, or whatever legal adult age may be in his or her country, is responsible for himself or herself. Nobody else is responsible for that person.
So from that point of view also, you cannot penalize anybody for what his or her adult children do. From that point of view, it's illegal, it's against all norms of justice. And from the point of view of democracy, it is not right to discriminate against one particular citizen. You wouldn't like to be discriminated against, would you?
So I think our people support the idea of amending this clause because -- not particularly because they want me to be president, perhaps because they do. But I don't think it is so much because of that, but because they realize that this is unfair, unjust and undemocratic.
I didn't bring up specific cases with him. I brought up a basic principle that I stated earlier, which is that a free press is a foundation for any democracy.
We rely on journalists to explain and describe the actions of our government. If the government controls the journalists, then it's very difficult for citizens to hold that government accountable. It's a fairly straightforward proposition. And I recognize that there is a transition process that's taking place, that there is a more robust debate today than there was the last time I visited. But to go back to what we said earlier, we can't be complacent. And we, as a government, are going to be troubled when we hear reports of journalists being imprisoned, being killed, being intimidated, or being censored.
And when we engage with this government -- or any government -- and we have evidence that that's taking place, then we're going to raise it.
Thank you very much.

Joe Biden,"When he said after Charlottesville there were, and I quote, “very fine people on both sides”, I said, then it gave license and safe harbor to white supremacists and Neo Nazis and the Klu Klux Klan. These words not only stunned America, but they stunned the world and in doing so, he has signed a moral equivalence. A moral equivalence between those spewing hate, and those that have the courage to stand against it. I said at the time, we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced my candidacy, and I say it here today. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That’s why primarily I’m running for president.
Charlottesville was no isolated incident. When Trump announced he was running for president, he called Mexicans rapists. Days before the midterm, he formatted fears of a caravan heading to United States creating hysteria when he said, “Look, look, some marching up. This is an invasion, an invasion.” He asserted that immigrants would quote, “carve you up with a knife”. More recently, he called a major American center city, a disgusting rat infected road mess. “No human being”, he said would choose to live as though the vibrant diverse community around Baltimore somehow was less than human. At a rally in Florida, when he asked the crowd, “How do we stop these people?” Meaning immigrants, someone yelled back, “Shoot them!” And he smiled. In North Carolina, he basked in the chants of “send her back” echoing across the stadium.
How far is it from Trump saying this is an invasion to the shooter in El Paso declaring quote, “this attack as a response to Hispanic invasion of Texas”. How far apart are those comments? How far is it from white supremacists in Neo Nazis in Charlottesville? Trump’s very fine people chanting “you will replace us”. To the shooter at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying, “we’re committing genocide”. Jews are committing genocide on his people.
I don’t think it’s that far at all. It is both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation. His low energy, vacant eyed mouthing the words written for him condemning white supremacists this week I don’t believe fooled anyone at home or abroad. His energetic embrace, an energetic embrace of this president by the darkest hearts and most hate-filled minds in this country say it all. When the white nationalist Richard Spencer celebrated Trump’s election by declaring, “hail Trump” at an alt-right conference where the Nazi salute was being used. In Charlottesville, David Duke, the former leader of the KKK said, “This is why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take back the country.”
He knows it. He saw it, and on 8chan, a haven for radicalism on the internet where a declaration of hate linked to El Paso shooter was posted. One commentator wrote that Trump is helping normalize the most extreme radical sentiments because his perceived authority carries so much weight. We have a problem with this rising tide of white supremacy in America, and we have a president who encourages and emboldens it. The statistics are clear. Extremism is on the rise in America. The southern poverty center finds that of the 1020 hate groups operating in the United States in 2018, that’s how many there are. They pointed out that white nationalist groups have surged by over 50%. In 2017, an active shooter with ties to white extremism claimed 135 victims and 70 killed. According to the Anti Defamation League, all but one of the 50 extremists linked murders counted in 2018 had direct links to white supremacists.
His own FBI director recently testified to Congress that extreme right-wing groups, white nationalists posed the greatest threat to racially motivated domestic terrorism. And what has Trump done? He’s poured fuel on the fire. He’s retweeted postings from extremists and white nationalists. He’s cutting funding, and in some cases, completely eliminated funding initiated by Barak, by the president and I, in our administration to counter violent extremism at home. Trump readily, eagerly attacks Islamic terrorism, but can barely bring himself to use the words white supremacy. Even when he says it, he doesn’t appear to believe it. He seems more concerned about losing their votes than beating back this hateful ideology. He says guns are not the problem in mass shootings. The issue is mental health. It’s a dodge. Hatred isn’t a mental health issue. I can tell you as the guy along with Senator Dianne Feinstein, got the assault weapons banned and the high capacity magazines banned in this country for 10 years, if elected presidents, we will do it again. We will do it again.
A hundred rounds date, 30 round clips in El Paso. They’ll be banned. And when we do it, we will put in place a buy back program to get as many as these military style weapons of war as possible off the street, and we need a domestic terrorism law. We can do it without infringing on anyone’s free speech, without tampering with anybody’s liberties. Quite simply, we have to make the same commitment as a nation to root out domestic terrorism that we have stopping international terrorism.
I wish I could say that this all began with Donald Trump and will end with him, but it didn’t and I won’t. American history is not a fairy tale. The battle for the soul of the nation has been a constant push and pull for 243 years between the American ideal that says we’re all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The same document that promised to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity also allowed for slavery, and the so-called three fifths compromise that discounted the very humanity of black people in America at the time. The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out, but it’s never a route. It’s always a fight and it’s a battle that has never fully finished.
Go back to the beginning, Thomas Jefferson wrote what many believed to be the most important civil document in human history, but he was a slaveholder. We’ve never lived up to our American ideals, Jefferson himself didn’t. But what he wrote has pulled us towards justice for more than two centuries and still does. It remains this nation’s north star. Take a look at the Klan, Klu Klux Klan. After the Civil War, we saw a rise in the Klan. It was beaten down only to rise up again in the twenties. In fact, in August of 1925, 30,000 fully clad Klansmen in their robes and pointed hats marched down Pennsylvania Avenue, the streets of Washington. Imagine. Imagine that today. And then the Klan was once again beaten back as it was after the Civil War. How? The courts, the press, and yes, presidents stood against them, and that is the point. Our institutions, often imperfectly, stood against hate at moments when we’ve been most tested.
American presidents have stepped up in the past. George H W Bush renouncing his membership in the NRA. President Clinton after Oklahoma City. George W. Bush going to a mosque after 9/11, President Obama after Charleston. Presidents who led, who oppose, chose to fight for what the best of American character is about. There’s deafening silence now. Sadly, we don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation and it makes winning this battle for the soul of our nation that much tougher, harder. Trump doesn’t understand what Franklin D Roosevelt did. Roosevelt said, the presidency is quote, “preeminently a place of moral leadership”. You don’t see what JFK did when he said “only the president represents the national interest”. He’s blind. Lyndon Baines Johnson said of the office when he said, quote, “nothing makes a man come to grips more directly with his conscience than the presidency.”
Trump offers no moral leadership and seems to have no interest in unifying this nation. No evidence that the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least. Indeed, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has publicly and unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division. So it’s up to us as it was in the 20s, it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history where our president isn’t up to the moment, where our president lacks the moral authority to lead, where our president has more in common with George Wallace than he does with George Washington.
You know, we are almost 330 million Americans. We’ll have to do what our president can’t, stand together, stand against hate, stand up for what’s best, our nation’s best. When we’re the best. In this nation, we believe, when we’re at our best, we believe in honesty, decency, treating everyone with respect, giving everyone a fair shot, leaving nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor, demonizing no one, not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant or the other, leading by the power of our example, not by the example of our power. That’s allowed us to stand as a beacon to the world, being part of something bigger than ourselves. It’s a code. It’s uniquely American code. It’s who we are, but Donald Trump doesn’t get it.
What this president doesn’t understand is that like every other nation on earth, we’re unable to define what constitutes America by religion, by ethnicity, or by tribe. You can’t do it. America’s an idea. An idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most destitute people on earth. It’s not only our values that are under assault, our democracy is as well. Free press, new independent judiciary, legislature. There’s a co-equal branch of government. These are the guard rails of our democracy. They’re written into our Constitution, and if you’ve noticed for the last two plus years, they’ve been under attack. Phrases like fake news, enemy of the people. They’re no joke. They’re insidious. They’re corrosion.
Just look around the world. The worst despots are now using Trump’s language to justify their own abuses of power. Trump is trying to weaken our institutions, the press, the courts, the congress, precisely because they are the only checks on his power. That’s what this is all about. The abuse of power. There’s one thing I can’t stand and I know you can’t, is the abuse of power, whether it’s a boss taking advantage of his or her workers or a man raising his hand to a woman or a child or president who’s running rough shot over everything this country believes in standards.
No matter how old or young you are, you’ve never seen anything like this in your lifetime. We’re being reminded every day there’s nothing guaranteed about democracy, not even here in America. We have to constantly earn it. We have to protect it. We have to fight for it. I believe America is in, as Lincoln named us the last best hope on earth. We have to remember why. It’s not because you’re the biggest economy, the strongest military in the history of the world, it’s not because we have the most innovative entrepreneurs and the greatest research universities. That’s all true, but it’s not why we’re America.
The reason is what we believe. The most powerful idea in the history of the world, I think beats in the heart of the people of this country. It beats in all of us. No matter your race, your ethnicity, no matter your gender identity, your sexual orientation, no matter your faith, it beats in the hearts of the rich and poor alike, it unites America whether your ancestors were native to these shores, or they were brought here and forcibly enslaved, or they’re immigrants with generations back, like my family from Ireland or those coming today looking to build a better life for their families.
The American creed that were all created equal was written long ago, but the genius of every generation of Americans has open it wider and wider and wider to include those who have been excluded in a previous generation. That’s why it’s never gathered any dust in our history books. It’s still alive today, more than 200 years after its inception. But I honest to God don’t believe Donald Trump’s sees it that way. On January 20th, 2017 in his inaugural address, Donald Trump painted a dark, bleak picture of our country in crisis when he declared, and I quote, “this American carnage stops right here. It stops right now”. But as the sitting president, Trump’s anger, hate and divisiveness, pitting Americans against one another, preying on our division and doing nothing, nothing about the endemic and the epidemic of guns is fueling a literal carnage in America.
We now have more mass shootings in the year 2019 since January than we had day’s the past since January one 2019. As of Monday, according to the data from the gun violence archive, there’ve been 255 mass shootings in the first 217 days of this year. We can’t let this go on. We can’t, and I will not let this man be reelected President of the United States of America. We can’t. Folks. Folks.
His incompetence, his amorality, his carnage stops with us right here, right now, starting in the Midwest. Limit it to four years, I believe, I really do believe this. In history, we’ll look back on this presidency as an abberant moment in American history, but if Donald Trump is reelected, I believe he will forever and fundamentally alter in the character of this nation. If we give Donald Trump four more years, this will not be the country envisioned by Washington and Adams and Jefferson. We give Donald Trump four more years, this will not be the nation bound together by Lincoln. We give Donald Trump four more years, this will not be the nation lifted up by Roosevelt or inspired by Kennedy. It will not be the nation. The Barack Obama proved bends toward justice.
The danger Donald Trump and the alt-right pose to this nation isn’t hypothetical or exaggerating. It’s real. The core values is this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that makes America America is at stake. Folks, everyone knows who Donald Trump is. Even the people who support him, we have to show who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose science over fiction. We choose unity over division and yes, we choose truth over lies. If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation. We are the United States of America. There is not a single thing beyond our capacity if we stand together and get up and remember who we are. This is United States of America. Period. Thank you, and may God protect our troops.
"
Harvey Proctor,"This is the first occasion upon which I have sought to raise a matter on the Adjournment of the House. I do so now because of its importance and significance to my constituents. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Health replied on 3 December to the Adjournment debate of my hon. Both debates have their origin in the decision of the Basildon and Thurrock health authority to reorganise health services in its district. As my right hon. Friend indicated in his reply on 3 December, the health authority’s proposed changes form a wide-ranging package of proposals and are largely interdependent, one upon the other.
The proposals are contained in a document from the health authority that is entitled
“Consultative document for the reorganisation of hospital services, particularly involving the maternity, gynaecology, paediatric, regional plastic surgery/burns and some geriatric services and thereby the closure of in-patient facilities at St. Andrew’s hospital Billericay and changes to Orsett and Basildon hospitals.”
I have received over 600 personal, individual letters opposing the proposals. That is an enormous mailbag on any one subject. I have received nine petitions, including one from the Federation of Essex Women’s Institutes that is signed by 4,200 people. More than 20 separate organisations have registered their opposition with me. The consultants’ staff committee for the district is also opposed to the recommendations. On Monday I shall help to deliver a petition to the health authority that contains over 80,000 signatures. In total, that represents locally the strongest, unified body of opinion placed before me since first becoming a Member of Parliament in 1979. To that body of opinion I wish to add my support and hence this Adjournment debate.
I have had three separate meetings with county councillor Mrs. Joan Martin and Mr. Richard Taylor, the ​ chairman and the administrator of the health authority. I thank them for their courtesy and frankness. I plan to meet them again after the consultation ends on 21 December —on 13 January. I urge all my constituents who have not already done so to let the health authority know their feelings before the 21 December deadline.
Let me try to explain briefly to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Health why we all feel so strongly, although I appreciate that he will not be able to comment in any detail. St. Andrew’s hospital is old. The oldest part of the site dates back to 1840 and some accommodation is contained in temporary huts erected during the second world war. But it is a well loved local hospital with a deservedly high reputation and, with the plastic surgery and burns unit, a reputation far beyond the bounds of my constituency. However, most of the buildings on the site are in good condition, with the exception of the emergency medical services wards, and a considerable amount of money has been spent on the site and the hospital in recent years.
The hospital is well sited geographically. It is convenient. A recent survey shows that if the services are transferred to Basildon, 57 per cent. of current patients would experience an increase in return travelling time of an extra one hour and 26 minutes every time they visited the hospital. Basildon would be only marginally faster for only 23 per cent. of current patients.
Inevitably, a move will risk the break up of the team of specialists in various disciplines so important to the super specialities which operate at St. Andrew’s. The team includes not just the consultants and surgeons but the physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists and nurses, all of whom have pooled their expertise. A move will inevitably loosen up that team for no good purpose.
On 3 December my right hon. Friend said that we have to achieve a proper balanced judgment which will ensure
“efficient use of resources to the benefit of everyone concerned.”
However, a central plank of the current proposals is the move of a purpose-built burns unit which was opened only three years ago. It is the ideal burns unit format, separate and isolated from other services. I am afraid that my right hon. Friend was wrong on 3 December when he inferred that burns patients would be rehoused
“in modern buildings more suitable for the practice of modem medicine.
Option 5 of the health authority report clearly envisages that the burns unit will be placed in existing ward accommodation vacated by the maternity unit. That is completely unacceptable. Cross-infection would be much more difficult to prevent and it would be a wholly backward step.
My right hon. Friend knows well the problems of recruitment for the NHS. Yet the Billericay site, I am pleased and not at all surprised to say, is the easiest site in the district for which to recruit. I am told that Basildon is not good and that the difficulties at Orsett are appalling. That is a fact which must weigh heavily with my right hon. Friend.
Remarkably, option 5 did not take into account another hospital in Billericay, the Mayflower. The 75 long-stay geriatric beds there in an old building must sensibly be considered as must the question of whether the 35 acute ​ geriatric beds at St. Andrew’s hospital should not be placed at an acute hospital as best medical experience advises.
All the consultants at St. Andrew’s hospital have supported an alternative proposal involving the closure of the Mayflower hospital for long-stay geriatric patients, as envisaged in the district strategic plan for 1983–93, the transfer of those beds to a redeveloped St. Andrew’s and the switch of the acute geriatric beds to Basildon hospital, where there is no geriatric provision. The alternative has been submitted to the district health authority for consideration and I believe it to be a well-argued document.
If the proposals go through unamended, there will be a threat to voluntary endeavour. Building the burns unit cost £1·2 million, of which £400,000 was raised by the spectacularly successful burns unit appeal. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point for all that he did to get the burns unit established and for his help with that spectacular appeal.
Is that endeavour to be wasted? Not only will those who gave their time, effort and money feel hurt, offended and angry, but the goodwill that was generated will disappear. People in Billericay and Essex generally will never again respond to help the NHS and I, for one, would not blame them.
I have said outside the House, and I should repeat for the record, that we are not talking about cuts, although our political opponents will muddy the waters by suggesting that we are. In fact, we are talking about how sensibly to spend increased sums of money on the Health Service locally. We must remember that there is no limit to the amount of money that could be spent. The level is an arbitrary one and a matter of political judgment. Locally, we must get the best deal in the best interests of the patients. They must come first.
As a Government, nationally we have done well. We have 58,000 more nurses and midwives, over 5,000 more hospital doctors and dentists, 3,000 more family doctors and over 13,000 more radiologists, laboratory technicians and other professional staff than were in place in 1978. They are all caring for patients. Government spending on health services has increased by 23 per cent. in real terms. This year, the NHS will receive over double the amount provided by the Labour Government in 1978–79.
We must ensure that the money spent locally by our health authority is well spent. I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister will realise that I mean no disrespect when I say that I hope that these local matters do not come to him for his decision. I hope that cold logic and rational argument will win the day with the health authority. However, the Minister now knows the strength of feeling on the issue; that feeling will not abate until St. Andrew’s hospital and the burns unit are saved.
"
Matt Hancock,"Mr Speaker, with permission, I would like to make a statement on our action against coronavirus and the decisions we’ve been taking throughout the day today to determine what we need in Leicester.
We continue our determined fight against this invisible killer.
The number of new cases yesterday was 642, lower than when lockdown began.
And according to the latest figures, the number of deaths in all settings is down to 66.
We are successfully turning the tide.
And part of this success lies in our ability to take action locally, whenever we see it flare up.
Often this is on a very small scale – swiftly and quietly – like in an individual farm or a factory.
But when needed, we also act on a broader basis, as we have done in Leicester.
And today I wanted to update the House on the situation in Leicester.
At the end of June we made the decision to close schools and non-essential retail in the city, and not to introduce the relaxations that applied elsewhere from 4 July, like the reopening of pubs.
This was not an easy decision, but it was one that we had to take.
At that point, the 7-day infection rate in Leicester was 135 cases per 100,000 people, which was 3 times higher than the next highest city.
And Leicester was accounting for 10% of all positive cases in the country.
This decision was taken with the agreement of all local leaders.
And I am grateful to the leader and officers of Leicestershire County Council, and to the officers of Leicester City Council, for their support and hard work.
Since then, we’ve doubled testing.
And through a monumental programme of communications and community engagement, we’ve been pushing our important messages.
I committed to reviewing the measures in Leicester every 2 weeks.
This morning I chaired a Gold meeting of the Local Action Committee to discuss the latest situation.
And this afternoon, I held a further meeting with local leaders, Public Health England, the JBC, the local resilience forum, and my clinical advisers.
The latest data show that the 7-day infection rate in Leicester is now 119 cases per 100,000 people, and that the percentage of people who have tested positive is now at 4.8%.
These are positive indicators, especially in light of the huge increase in testing in the local area.
But they still remain well above the national average, and the average for surrounding areas.
Thanks to the incredible efforts of people of Leicester, who have followed the lockdown, even while others have had their freedom relaxed, we are now in a position to relax some, but not all, of the restrictions that were in place.
So, from 24 July we’ll be removing the restrictions on schools and early years childcare and taking a more targeted approach to the restrictions on non-essential retail.
Replacing the national decision to close non-essential retail with a local power to close them where necessary. This is all part of our more targeted approach.
However, other restrictions, like those for travel and only having social gatherings of up to 6 people, for example, will remain in force.
And measures introduced on 4 July, like re-opening the hospitality sector, will also not yet apply.
The initial definition of the geography covered by the lockdown was a decision I delegated to Leicestershire County Council, and they made and published.
The Leader of Leicestershire County Council, Nicholas Rushton, has advised me, based on the data and the best public health advice, that he recommends these restrictions now apply only to the Oadby and Wigston area of Leicestershire, as well as the City of Leicester itself.
And I have accepted his advice.
Some say that the local lockdown is unnecessary. I wish this were true.
But sadly it remains vital for the health of everyone in Leicester, and the rest of the country, that these restrictions stay in place.
We will review them again in a fortnight.
I hope that this careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to people in Leicester and Leicestershire.
And I’d say this directly to the people of Leicester and Leicestershire – I’d like to pay tribute to you all.
Your perseverance and your hard work has brought real and tangible results.
And you have shown respect for one another.
I understand this hasn’t been easy.
Strong representations have been made to me by my honourable friends, the members for Charnwood, Harborough and South Leicestershire and for the members opposite who represent the city of Leicester, on behalf of constituents who have been impacted, and constituents who wanted to see the lockdown lifted too.
However, there is still a lot to do. And the public health messages remain critical.
So please get a test if you have symptoms.
Keep following the rules that are in place.
Please do not lose your resolve.
Because the sooner we get this virus under control, the sooner we can restore life in Leicester, and across the country, to normal.
Mr Speaker, this statement also gives me the opportunity to inform the House of an issue relating to testing.
We have identified some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we will be carrying out further testing of this batch.
As a precautionary measure and while we investigate further, we are requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits are paused in all settings until further notice.
This problem was brought to my attention yesterday afternoon. We contacted settings using these swabs last night, and published the pause notice immediately.
Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm.
Those test results are not affected.
There is no evidence of issues with any of our other tests swabs.
And there is no impact on access to testing.
Mr Speaker, our ability to take action on this local level is the keystone of our plan to defeat coronavirus.
So we can keep this virus on the run and defeat it once and for all.
I’m grateful to you for allowing me to make this statement at this time and I commend this statement to the House.
"
Barack Obama,"Thank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. I love you back. Thank you. Thank you. 
Well, thank you so much. I am still fired up and ready to go. Thank you. Thank you.
Well, first of all, I want to congratulate Senator Clinton on a hard-fought victory here in New Hampshire. She did an outstanding job. Give her a big round of applause. 
You know, a few weeks ago, no one imagined that we'd have accomplished what we did here tonight in New Hampshire. No one could have imagined it. 
For most of this campaign, we were far behind. We always knew our climb would be steep. But in record numbers, you came out, and you spoke up for change. 
And with your voices and your votes, you made it clear that at this moment, in this election, there is something happening in America. 
There is something happening when men and women in Des Moines and Davenport, in Lebanon and Concord, come out in the snows of January to wait in lines that stretch block after block because they believe in what this country can be. 
There is something happening. There's something happening when Americans who are young in age and in spirit, who've never participated in politics before, turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different. 
There's something happening when people vote not just for party that they belong to, but the hopes that they hold in common. 
And whether we are rich or poor, black or white, Latino or Asian, whether we hail from Iowa or New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction. 
That's what's happening in America right now; change is what's happening in America. 
You, all of you who are here tonight, all who put so much heart and soul and work into this campaign, you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness. 
Democrats, independents and Republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded Washington, who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable, who understand that, if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better, there is no problem we cannot solve, there is no destiny that we cannot fulfill.Our new American majority can end the outrage of unaffordable, unavailable health care in our time. We can bring doctors and patients, workers and businesses, Democrats and Republicans together, and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that, while they get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair, not this time, not now. 
Our new majority can end the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of working Americans who deserve it. 
We can stop sending our children to schools with corridors of shame and start putting them on a pathway to success. 
We can stop talking about how great teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness by giving them more pay and more support. We can do this with our new majority. 
We can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists, citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return. 
And when I am President of the United States, we will end this war in Iraq and bring our troops home. 
We will end this war in Iraq. We will bring our troops home. We will finish the job -- We will finish the job against Al Qaida in Afghanistan. We will care for our veterans. We will restore our moral standing in the world.
All of the candidates in this race share these goals. All of the candidates in this race have good ideas and all are patriots who serve this country honorably. 
But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago is because it's not just about what I will do as president. It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it. 
That's what this election is all about. 
That's why tonight belongs to you. It belongs to the organizers, and the volunteers, and the staff who believed in this journey and rallied so many others to join the cause. 
We know the battle ahead will be long. But always remember that, no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change. 
We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. And they will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks and months to come. 
We've been asked to pause for a reality check. We've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope. 
Yes we can.
Yes we can.
Yes we can. 
Yes we can -- to opportunity and prosperity.
Yes we can heal this nation.
Yes we can repair this world.
Yes we can. 
And so, tomorrow, as we take the campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile workers in Spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in Las Vegas, that the hopes of the little girl who goes to the crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of L.A., we will remember that there is something happening in America, that we are not as divided as our politics suggest, that we are one people, we are one nation. 
Thank you, New Hampshire.
Thank you. Thank you.
"
Steve Baker,"I will begin by setting out our approach to publishing economic analysis, I hope once and for all.
I can confirm that—I think the right hon. I can confirm that when we bring forward the vote on the final deal that we agree with the European Union, we will ensure that the House is presented with the appropriate analysis that the Government have carried out, so that the House can make an informed decision. All Members must surely agree, however, that the Government cannot be expected to put such an analysis into the public domain before it has been completed. That would misrepresent our views. Furthermore, the Government cannot be expected to publish the analysis while the negotiations continue, which would surely harm the national interest. Parliament has rightfully agreed that Ministers have a duty not to publish anything that could risk exposing our negotiating position.
Let me now turn to the article that prompted the urgent question. It is a selective interpretation of a preliminary analysis. It is an attempt to undermine our exit from the European Union. As I have told the House before, the Government are undertaking a wide range of analysis on our exit from the EU. The next stage of that analysis, summarised in a draft paper presented to Ministers this month, has been a cross-Whitehall effort to support our negotiating priorities. It has not been led by my Department, and it is not yet anywhere near being approved by Ministers. Even the ministerial team in my Department has only just been consulted on the paper, in recent days, and we have made it clear that it requires significant further work. In fact, I saw this report myself only this morning. The analysis to which I believe this article refers is a preliminary attempt to improve on the flawed analysis around the EU referendum. It is there to test ideas and to design a viable framework for the analysis of our exit from the EU. At this early stage, it only considers off-the-shelf trade arrangements that currently exist; we have been clear that these are not what we are seeking in the negotiations. It does not yet consider our desired outcome: the most ambitious relationship possible with the EU, as set out by the Prime Minister in her Florence speech.
Such an agreement is in the interests of both the UK and the EU. Therefore, the scenarios in this analysis continue to suffer from the flaws we have seen in previous analyses of this type. Such analyses have been proved to be wrong in the wake of the referendum, not least because there is huge uncertainty around any forecast, especially in the long run and especially in the context of a major strategic choice.
It is the Government’s job to improve on this analysis, but to do so we first have to understand where it went wrong previously. That is what the analysis to which this article refers is: it is not a forecast for our preferred outcome of the negotiations; it does not yet properly take account of the opportunities of leaving the EU.
Finally, on 23 June 2016 the people of this country took a decision to leave the EU in the context of a wide range of economic information. The purpose of this analysis is not to question that decision, which this House voted overwhelmingly to uphold. I hope all Members of this House will agree that we should continue to respect the result of the referendum.

Donald Trump,"Well, the economy is doing very well. We're seeing wages rise more than they have at any time for a long, long time. Wages are going up first time for many years -- I talked about it during the campaign -- for over 20 years. So, I'm happy about that. The economy is very, very strong.
If you look at the stock market over the last few months, it's been great. And certainly since my election, it's up -- getting close to 50 percent -- the stock market. So, we're obviously very happy with that. We will -- I think as soon as these trade deals are done, if they get done -- and we're working with China; we'll see what happens -- but I think you're going to see a very big spike.
A lot of people are waiting to see what happens with the China deal. Mexico, Canada is done. We'll be submitting to Congress very shortly. And that's a great deal for the United States, so we're very happy about that. And I am now, as you know, going to Alabama. Some of you are joining me. But I look forward to it. I'll be meeting with Governor Ivey.
The people of Alabama, they got hit very hard by the tornadoes. We're stopping there, then we're going to Florida. And we're going to do a lot of work. We'll be working very hard.
I feel very badly for Paul Manafort. I think it's been a very, very tough time for him. But if you notice, both his lawyer -- a highly respected man and a very highly respected judge -- the judge said there was no collusion with Russia. It's had nothing to do with collusion. There was no collusion. It's a collusion hoax.
It's a collusion witch-hoax. I don’t collude with Russia. So I just want to tell you that his lawyer went out of his way, actually, to make a statement last night. No collusion with Russia. There was absolutely none. The judge, I mean, for whatever reason -- I was very honored by it -- also made the statement that this had nothing do with collusion with Russia.
So, you know, keep it going. Let's go. Keep the hoax going. Just a hoax. Senator Burr said there's no collusion. If you look at Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Commission -- Committee -- they said there's no collusion. And guess what? There is none.
What?
Well, it's a step. I think you'll probably find out it averages out. The unemployment rate just went lower. We're down now to 3.8 percent, so we had very good news on that. I think the big news, really, was that wages went up. And that's great for the American worker. That’s something people -- I don’t know if they ever expected to see it. Yeah?
Well, I haven’t heard that. I think they're doing well. But if it happened that way, we'll do even better. We’ll do very well either way, with or without a deal. But you're telling me something that I have not heard.
Yeah. Sure. I'm confident. But if we don’t make a very good deal for our country, I wouldn’t make a deal. If this isn’t a great deal, I won't make a deal.
Say it?
I don’t even discuss it. I have -- the only one discussing it is you. I haven’t discussed it. I know that, in watching and seeing you folks at night, that Michael Cohen lied about the pardon. It was a stone-cold lie. And he's lied about a lot of things, but when he lied about the pardon, that was really a lie.
And he knew all about pardons. His lawyers said that they went to my lawyers and asked for pardons. And I can go a step above that, but I won't go do it now.
Why what?
It's the most ridiculous suit I've ever seen. Bad lawyer. I had a bad lawyer. Go ahead. That happens.
We'll make a comment on it later.
Talk. Talk. Up. You're competing with a helicopter, John.
Well, I think that it's going very well. The border -- we're doing a great job. We're apprehending record numbers of people -- 75,000 over the last short period of time. That's a lot of work. And with a wall, we wouldn't have to do it. No, I think we're doing fine in Congress. They understand it's an emergency.
Well, time will tell, but I have a feeling that our relationship with North Korea -- Kim Jong Un and myself -- Chairman Kim -- I think it's a very good one. I think it remains good. I would be surprised, in a negative way, if he did anything that was not per our understanding. But we'll see what happens.
Look, when I came in -- under the Obama administration, North Korea was a disaster. You were going to war, folks, whether you know it or not. You were going to war. There was no talking. There was testing. We didn't have our people back. We didn't have our great hostages back. Now we're getting the remains, we're doing a lot of things now.
This was a disaster. I inherited a mess. In many ways, I inherited -- the Middle East, I inherited a mess, and it's straightening out a lot. We're doing very well there. I inherited a mess.
I inherited -- wait. Wait. I inherited a mess with North Korea. And right now, you have no testing. You have no nothing. Let's see what happens. But I would be very disappointed if I saw testing.
I thought yesterday's vote by the House was disgraceful because it's become -- the Democrats have become an anti-Israel party. They've become an anti-Jewish party. And I thought that vote was a disgrace and so does everybody else, if you get an honest answer. If you get an honest answer from politicians, they thought it was a disgrace.
The Democrats have become an anti-Israel party. They've become an anti-Jewish party, and that's too bad. I'm going to Alabama.
"
Margaret Hodge,"I’ve seen that statement. I think it’s bizarre, it’s obsessional, and I think a little humility shown by Jeremy Corbyn at this point of time would be most welcome. Not only did nine out of 10 Jewish people before the last general election fear the advent of Jeremy Corbyn as our prime minister, not only have we got the inquiry by the human rights commission, but we have the most resounding defeat ever in the last general election. The British people spoke. And I think Jeremy’s just got to start listening to that. He’s got to start showing a little humility. The less said by him at the moment, the better, not just for us, the Labour party, but for him too and for his future and reputation.
"
Ernest Pretyman,"It is a kindly custom of this House to regard with special indulgence the Member to whom is entrusted the duty which I have to discharge to-day, and I feel sure that I shall have given me even double indulgence because the occasion is not an ordinary one, and I cannot and do not pretend to have that special knowledge which alone would enable me to do full justice to it.
Ordinarily our discussions here are upon controversial matters. As mover of the Address it is difficult to be non-controversial without being colourless. But to-day there is common ground I shall have to traverse, and there are feelings which we shall all share on whichever side of the House we sit. The first of these feelings is that of deep sympathy, which it is our privilege to express, as representing the nation, with all sufferers by the war which is going on in South Africa.
It will hardly be necessary to enumerate the sufferings which are in the minds of everyone of us here, but I think we must first refer to those who are suffering from wounds and from bodily disablement. Then, Sir, our sympathy must go out to those who are bereaved, to the widow and childless, and also to the weary watchers who have their dear ones at the front, and who are daily waiting for news—painful news such as we received this morning, and which carries sorrow and distress into many a home.
There is one other expression of sympathy which I am sure will not be wanting, and that is an expression of the deepest sympathy with the sufferings of colony of Natal. Half the colony is in the hands of the enemy, and not only have they put into the field a force far out of proportion to their numbers, but they have suffered grievous loss of property and life.
I trust we may be in a position at the end of the war to recompense them for the losses and suffering they have experienced. We have also feelings of the deepest admiration for the gallantry which our soldiers have displayed. Whether it be in the gallant defence of Mafeking, or the no less gallant and protracted defence of Ladysmith, or in the gallant action of Wauchope and the Highland Brigade at Magersfontein, where so many lost their lives, the story is the same, and it is a story of which we are all proud.
It is our only regret that so many of those to whom our pride goes out are lost for ever. In addition to that we have another common ground. We have pride not only in the gallantry that this contest has evoked, but also in the national spirit which has been evinced. That national spirit is not confined to the British Islands. It has found expression to the utmost bounds of this Empire. If we look at the present position of the Empire as a whole, we may say with truth we have set a girdle round the globe, and every link rings true and clear at this moment. I believe when this war is over we may look forward to South Africa being peaceful and tranquil and contented, and that any rift which may exist can and will be repaired in a way which will cause less offence and less trouble in the future.
Although at the end of the war there will, no doubt, remain a certain amount of race antagonism, which is the natural result of a contest of this description, we shall at any rate have purged the contempt with which that race antagonism was previously associated; the races will have learned to respect one another, and will be able to live side by side in amity, the hatreds of the past being merged into a mutual liking. Contempt is the kindling which fans antagonism into flame; and it was that contempt combined with race antagonism which brought about the present conflict.
When the struggle is concluded let us hope that the contempt which has arisen from surface causes will have been purged, that Boer and Briton will live side by side in peace, and that both will have a great future before them under the British flag. One other feeling we have in common, and that is the feeling of regret for the reverses which we have suffered in South Africa. Further than that we have the unanimous determination to retrieve those reverses. We wish to examine and to investigate the causes of the reverses and the failures, if they may be so called, which have occurred in our campaign. I am here, perhaps, on delicate ground, but I think I may say this.
We may ask ourselves with advantage whether our weakness or our failures, if I may use that word, are due to any deep-seated and inherent national weakness, or to temporary and removable causes. I think the latter can only be the answer. The Empire and the resources of the nation were never stronger than at this moment, but our power does not lie on the surface. It is deep-seated, and the causes which we have to inquire into if they are temporary and removable must be inquired into with a view to their being removed.
I feel sure that no obstacle will be thrown in the way, but that the Government will welcome an inquiry in any form which may be agreeable to the House and which will enable us to discover the causes of the difficulty, and to remove them. There is one consideration which occurs to me, and that is that of “inadequate preparation.” Is that one of the principal causes for our difficulties? I would rather say it is not so much inadequate preparation as the insufficient estimate of the forces arrayed against us.
In the case of the Crimean war the preparations were inadequate for any war, but I doubt if we were ever so well prepared to undertake a campaign on a certain scale as when this war broke out three months ago. If there was a fault it was the under-estimate of the forces arrayed against us, and it will be for us to consider how the under-estimate arose. There are many factors to be considered, some of which are new, but I think that we shall find—or, at any rate, it so appears to me—that those factors in themselves were to a certain extent foreseen, and that there was some knowledge of them. But the result of the combination of all those factors and the strength of the enemy, from a defensive point of view, which we had to engage, was not foreseen or measured, so far as I am aware, by any person.
The want of prophetic power was not confined to the Government alone, it was common to the country as a whole. That, at all events, was the impression at which I arrived in this House three months ago: that nobody on this or that side of the House, or in the country, had measured the strength of the enemy arrayed against us or, if so, the expressions of opinion were few and far between.
Who could have realised that this campaign would resolve itself into the taking of a series of natural fortresses of enormous strength, ably defended by troops of unexampled mobility, instructed by Continental experts, and armed with the most perfect weapons ever used in warfare? It is perhaps difficult to realise how small a factor will determine success or failure. Such a thing as a barbed wire fence may easily turn a victory into a defeat, and to sum up all these factors is almost impossible after fifty years of peace, which we have passed through, when many of these factors are to a large extent unknown.
There has been some criticism in which I as an artilleryman feel particularly interested. Our field guns have been condemned on all sides because they are of less range than the guns of the enemy; but one thing has been forgotten, and that is that our field guns have been compared with guns of the enemy, which are guns of position and not field guns at all, and for an artilleryman to estimate the efficiency of a field gun solely by its range is—I should look on as very much the same thing as a pressman who would judge the merits of a newspaper solely by its circulation. The situation is a most grave one, but it has its better side: I do not think that the resources of our opponents were immediately realised.
The Boer Republic had formed itself into a vast military machine, every part of which was perfect; our military machine was imperfect in the sense that our resources had not been called together. Is it therefore any wonder that the smaller perfect machine should for the moment be successful? But we have resources, and I hope that this House will support the Government in bringing every one of those resources into action to bring about our supremacy. They are only just now coming into play, and although we have now been checked more than once, when once the ring is broken the collapse may be as sudden as our progress, up to the present, has been slow.
The last struggle for the relief of Ladysmith, it was hoped, would be the beginning of the end, as it is it is only the end of the beginning. But this House has not only to consider the cause of the difficulty, but the cause and the motive which led up to the war itself. Here I am on very delicate ground, and it would not become me in the duty I have to perform to-day to examine the questions which have been, and which will have to be, discussed here; but I should like to make one observation. Although some may attribute a motive to this or that person or politician, I think we may all agree that the national motive for this war is a pure and just one.
The motive which has for centuries animated this country, and which animates it now, is that we shall obtain justice and freedom for all races and all creeds. That is the great stream in which our national sentiment has run in the past and is running now. It will always occur that where there is a great stream of pure water there will be draining into it streams which are not so pure as the river itself, and no doubt uses will be made and motives attributed that do not exist.
The motive that animates us here, and the House and country generally, is to restore peace and freedom to all throughout South Africa. So far as I have observed that is the motive animating us all, and although we may have to engage our attention with that legislation which we are more accustomed to consider, our hearts will be with our soldiers in South Africa. But that is no reason why we should not consider other measures. We have submitted to us to-day no measures of heroic legislation or costly legislation. The only costly legislation will be the estimates for the war in South Africa.
Last year the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for a vote of eight millions. He would be a bold man who would say how much we shall be asked for this session. But whatever is asked for I hope will be cheerfully given. We cannot set money against the lives of our fellow subjects now being risked in South Africa. We shall be asked to sanction measures of improving and remodelling the Companies Act, and that a matter we shall gladly do because we know the loss which is suffered by those who are induced to part with their money under false pretences by fraudulent companies.
Another measure we shall be asked to consider is what is called an Agricultural Holdings Bill, and anything that this House can do towards the improvement of our agriculture will be greatly welcomed. We have, however, to remember that the conditions of our agricultural industry, vary greatly in different parts of the country. We have also to consider the incoming tenant as well as the outgoing, tenant. Sir, the situation before us is indeed a serious and a difficult one. It is, perhaps, the most serious and, perhaps, the most difficult situation which this country has had to face since the earliest years of the century. This is, indeed, a momentous session.
Our, ill-wishers, we know, are looking eagerly for any signs of weakness, of vacillation, or of disunion within these walls. On the other hand, the country, and the Empire in arms, are looking to us to express their unanimous determination to bring this struggle to a successful issue. Now, Sir, I need hardly ask the House to which of these we should afford satisfaction. The question can have but one answer. Therefore, I trust that the touchstone of all criticism will be not party advantage, but the needs and necessities of the Empire.
"
Martin Van Buren,"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: 
I congratulate you on the favorable circumstances in the condition of our country under which you reassemble for the performance of your official duties. Though the anticipations of an abundant harvest have not everywhere been realized, yet on the whole the labors of the husbandman are rewarded with a bountiful return; industry prospers in its various channels of business and enterprise; general health again prevails through our vast diversity of climate; nothing threatens from abroad the continuance of external peace; nor has anything at home impaired the strength of those fraternal and domestic ties which constitute the only guaranty to the success and permanency of our happy Union, and which, formed in the hour of peril, have hitherto been honorably sustained through every vicissitude in our national affairs. These blessings, which evince the care and beneficence of Providence, call for our devout and fervent gratitude.
We have not less reason to be grateful for other bounties bestowed by the same munificent hand, and more exclusively our own. 
The present year closes the first half century of our Federal institutions, and our system, differing from all others in the acknowledged practical and unlimited operation which it has for so long a period given to the sovereignty of the people, has now been fully tested by experience. 
The Constitution devised by our forefathers as the framework and bond of that system, then untried, has become a settled form of government; not only preserving and protecting the great principles upon which it was rounded, but wonderfully promoting individual happiness and private interests. Though subject to change and entire revocation whenever deemed inadequate to all these purposes, yet such is the wisdom of its construction and so stable has been the public sentiment that it remains unaltered except in matters of detail comparatively unimportant. It has proved amply sufficient for the various emergencies incident to our condition as a nation. A formidable foreign war; agitating collisions between domestic, and in some respects rival, sovereignties; temptations to interfere in the intestine commotions of neighboring countries; the dangerous influences that arise in periods of excessive prosperity, and the antirepublican tendencies of associated wealth--these, with other trials not less formidable, have all been encountered, and thus far successfully resisted. 
It was reserved for the American Union to test the advantages of a government entirely dependent on the continual exercise of the popular will, and our experience has shown that it is as beneficent in practice as it is just in theory. Each successive change made in our local institutions has contributed to extend the right of suffrage, has increased the direct influence of the mass of the community, given greater freedom to individual exertion, and restricted more and more the powers of Government; yet the intelligence, prudence, and patriotism of the people have kept pace with this augmented responsibility. In no country has education been so widely diffused. Domestic peace has nowhere so largely reigned. The close bonds of social intercourse have in no instance prevailed with such harmony over a space so vast. All forms of religion have united for the first time to diffuse charity and piety, because for the first time in the history of nations all have been totally untrammeled and absolutely free. The deepest recesses of the wilderness have been penetrated; yet instead of the rudeness in the social condition consequent upon such adventures elsewhere, numerous communities have sprung up, already unrivaled in prosperity, general intelligence, internal tranquillity, and the wisdom of their political institutions. Internal improvement, the fruit of individual enterprise, fostered by the protection of the States, has added new links to the Confederation and fresh rewards to provident industry. Doubtful questions of domestic policy have been quietly settled by mutual forbearance, and agriculture, commerce, and manufactures minister to each other. Taxation and public debt, the burdens which bear so heavily upon all other countries, have pressed with comparative lightness upon us. Without one entangling alliance, our friendship is prized by every nation, and the rights of our citizens are everywhere respected, because they are known to be guarded by a united, sensitive, and watchful people. 
To this practical operation of our institutions, so evident and successful, we owe that increased attachment to them which is among the most cheering exhibitions of popular sentiment and will prove their best security in time to come against foreign or domestic assault. 
This review of the results of our institutions for half a century, without exciting a spirit of vain exultation, should serve to impress upon us the great principles from which they have sprung--constant and direct supervision by the people over every public measure. strict forbearance on the part of the Government from exercising any doubtful or disputed powers, and a cautious abstinence from all interference with concerns which properly belong and are best left to State regulations and individual enterprise. 
Full information of the state of our foreign affairs having been recently on different occasions submitted to Congress, I deem it necessary now to bring to your notice only such events as have subsequently occurred or are of such importance as to require particular attention. 
The most amicable dispositions continue to be exhibited by all the nations with whom the Government and citizens of the United States have an habitual intercourse. At the date of my last annual message Mexico was the only nation which could not be included in so gratifying a reference to our foreign relations. 
I am happy to be now able to inform you that an advance has been made toward the adjustment of our differences with that Republic and the restoration of the customary good feeling between the two nations. This important change has been effected by conciliatory negotiations that have resulted in the conclusion of a treaty between the two Governments, which, when ratified, will refer to the arbitrament of a friendly power all the subjects of controversy between us growing out of injuries to individuals. There is at present also reason to believe that an equitable settlement of all disputed points will be attained without further difficulty or unnecessary delay, and thus authorize the free resumption of diplomatic intercourse with our sister Republic. 
With respect to the northeastern boundary of the United States, no official correspondence between this Government and that of Great Britain has passed since that communicated to Congress toward the close of their last session. The offer to negotiate a convention for the appointment of a joint commission of survey and exploration I am, however, assured will be met by Her Majesty's Government in a conciliatory and friendly spirit, and instructions to enable the British minister here to conclude such an arrangement will be transmitted to him without needless delay. It is hoped and expected that these instructions will be of a liberal character, and that this negotiation, if successful, will prove to be an important step toward the satisfactory and final adjustment of the controversy. 
I had hoped that the respect for the laws and regard for the peace and honor of their own country which have ever characterized the citizens of the United States would have prevented any portion of them from using any means to promote insurrection in the territory of a power with which we are at peace, and with which the United States are desirous of maintaining the most friendly relations. I regret deeply, however, to be obliged to inform you that this has not been the case. Information has been given to me, derived from official and other sources, that many citizens of the United States have associated together to make hostile incursions from our territory into Canada and to aid and abet insurrection there, in violation of the obligations and laws of the United States and in open disregard of their own duties as citizens. This information has been in part confirmed by a hostile invasion actually made by citizens of the United States, in conjunction with Canadians and others, and accompanied by a forcible seizure of the property of our citizens and an application thereof to the prosecution of military operations against the authorities and people of Canada.
The results of these criminal assaults upon the peace and order of a neighboring country have been, as was to be expected, fatally destructive to the misguided or deluded persons engaged in them and highly injurious to those in whose behalf they are professed to have been undertaken. The authorities in Canada, from intelligence received of such intended movements among our citizens, have felt themselves obliged to take precautionary measures against them; have actually embodied the militia and assumed an attitude to repel the invasion to which they believed the colonies were exposed from the United States. A state of feeling on both sides of the frontier has thus been produced which called for prompt and vigorous interference. If an insurrection existed in Canada, the amicable dispositions of the United States toward Great Britain, as well as their duty to themselves, would lead them to maintain a strict neutrality and to restrain their citizens from all violations of the laws which have been passed for its enforcement. But this Government recognizes a still higher obligation to repress all attempts on the part of its citizens to disturb the peace of a country where order prevails or has been reestablished. Depredations by our citizens upon nations at peace with the United States, or combinations for committing them, have at all times been regarded by the American Government and people with the greatest abhorrence. Military incursions by our citizens into countries so situated, and the commission of acts of violence on the members thereof, in order to effect a change in their government, or under any pretext whatever, have from the commencement of our Government been held equally criminal on the part of those engaged in them, and as much deserving of punishment as would be the disturbance of the public peace by the perpetration of similar acts within our own territory. 
By no country or persons have these invaluable principles of international law--principles the strict observance of which is so indispensable to the preservation of social order in the world--been more earnestly cherished or sacredly respected than by those great and good men who first declared and finally established the independence of our own country. They promulgated and maintained them at an early and critical period in our history; they were subsequently embodied in legislative enactments of a highly penal character, the faithful enforcement of which has hitherto been, and will, I trust, always continue to be, regarded as a duty inseparably associated with the maintenance of our national honor. That the people of the United States should feel an interest in the spread of political institutions as free as they regard their own to be is natural, nor can a sincere solicitude for the success of all those who are at any time in good faith struggling for their acquisition be imputed to our citizens as a crime. With the entire freedom of opinion and an undisguised expression thereof on their part the Government has neither the right nor, I trust, the disposition to interfere. But whether the interest or the honor of the United States requires that they should be made a party to any such struggle, and by inevitable consequence to the war which is waged in its support, is a question which by our Constitution is wisely left to Congress alone to decide. It is by the laws already made criminal in our citizens to embarrass or anticipate that decision by unauthorized military operations on their part. Offenses of this character, in addition to their criminality as violations of the laws of our country, have a direct tendency to draw down upon our own citizens at large the multiplied evils of a foreign war and expose to injurious imputations the good faith and honor of the country. As such they deserve to be put down with promptitude and decision. I can not be mistaken, I am confident, in counting on the cordial and general concurrence of our fellow-citizens in this sentiment. A copy of the proclamation which I have felt it my duty to issue is herewith communicated. I can not but hope that the good sense and patriotism, the regard for the honor and reputation of their country, the respect for the laws which they have themselves enacted for their own government, and the love of order for which the mass of our people have been so long and so justly distinguished will deter the comparatively few who are engaged in them from a further prosecution of such desperate enterprises. In the meantime the existing laws have been and will continue to be faithfully executed, and every effort will be made to carry them out in their full extent. Whether they are sufficient or not to meet the actual state of things on the Canadian frontier it is for Congress to decide. 
It will appear from the correspondence herewith submitted that the Government of Russia declines a renewal of the fourth article of the convention of April, 1824, between the United States and His Imperial Majesty, by the third article of which it is agreed that ""hereafter there shall not be formed by the citizens of the United States or under the authority of the said States any establishment upon the northwest coast of America, nor in any of the islands adjacent, to the north of 54? 40' of north latitude, and that in the same manner there shall be none formed by Russian subjects or under the authority of Russia south of the same parallel;"" and by the fourth article, ""that during a term of ten years, counting from the signature of the present convention, the ships of both powers, or which belong to their citizens or subjects, respectively, may reciprocally frequent, without any hindrance whatever, the interior seas, gulfs, harbors, and creeks upon the coast mentioned in the preceding article, for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives of the country."" The reasons assigned for declining to renew the provisions of this article are, briefly, that the only use made by our citizens of the privileges it secures to them has been to supply the Indians with spirituous liquors, ammunition, and firearms; that this traffic has been excluded from the Russian trade; and as the supplies furnished from the United States are injurious to the Russian establishments on the northwest coast and calculated to produce complaints between the two Governments, His Imperial Majesty thinks it for the interest of both countries not to accede to the proposition made by the American Government for the renewal of the article last referred to. 
The correspondence herewith communicated will show the grounds upon which we contend that the citizens of the United States have, independent of the provisions of the convention of 1824, a right to trade with the natives upon the coast in question at unoccupied places, liable, however, it is admitted, to be at any time extinguished by the creation of Russian establishments at such points. This right is denied by the Russian Government, which asserts that by the operation of the treaty of 1824 each party agreed to waive the general right to land on the vacant coasts on the respective sides of the degree of latitude referred to, and accepted in lieu thereof the mutual privileges mentioned in the fourth article. The capital and tonnage employed by our citizens in their trade with the northwest coast of America will, perhaps, on adverting to the official statements of the commerce and navigation of the United States for the last few years, be deemed too inconsiderable in amount to attract much attention; yet the subject may in other respects deserve the careful consideration of Congress. 
I regret to state that the blockade of the principal ports on the eastern coast of Mexico, which, in consequence of differences between that Republic and France, was instituted in May last, unfortunately still continues, enforced by a competent French naval armament, and is necessarily embarrassing to our own trade in the Gulf, in common with that of other nations. Every disposition, however, is believed to exist on the part of the French Government to render this measure as little onerous as practicable to the interests of the citizens of the United States and to those of neutral commerce, and it is to be hoped that an early settlement of the difficulties between France and Mexico will soon reestablish the harmonious relations formerly subsisting between them and again open the ports of that Republic to the vessels of all friendly nations. 
A convention for marking that part of the boundary between the United States and the Republic of Texas which extends from the mouth of the Sabine to the Red River was concluded and signed at this city on the 25th of April last. It has since been ratified by both Governments, and seasonable measures will be taken to carry it into effect on the part of the United States. 
The application of that Republic for admission into this Union, made in August, 1837, and which was declined for reasons already made known to you, has been formally withdrawn, as will appear from the accompanying copy of the note of the minister plenipotentiary of Texas, which was presented to the Secretary of State on the occasion of the exchange of the ratifications of the convention above mentioned. 
Copies of the convention with Texas, of a commercial treaty concluded with the King of Greece, and of a similar treaty with the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, the ratifications of which have been recently exchanged, accompany this message, for the information of Congress and for such legislative enactments as may be found necessary or expedient in relation to either of them. 
To watch over and foster the interests of a gradually increasing and widely extended commerce, to guard the rights of American citizens whom business or pleasure or other motives may tempt into distant climes, and at the same time to cultivate those sentiments of mutual respect and good will which experience has proved so beneficial in international intercourse, the Government of the United States has deemed it expedient from time to time to establish diplomatic connections with-different foreign states, by the appointment of representatives. to reside within their respective territories. I am gratified to be enabled to announce to you that since the close of your last session these relations have been opened under the happiest auspices with Austria and the Two Sicilies, that new nominations have been made in the respective missions of Russia, Brazil, Belgium, and Sweden and Norway in this country, and that a minister extraordinary has been received, accredited to this Government, from the Argentine Confederation. 
An exposition of the fiscal affairs of the Government and of their condition for the past year will be made to you by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
The available balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next is estimated at $2,765,342. The receipts of the year from customs and lands will probably amount to $20,615,598. These usual sources of revenue have been increased by an issue of Treasury notes, of which less than $8,000,000, including interest and principal, will be outstanding at the end of the year, and by the sale of one of the bonds of the Bank of the United States for $2,254,871. The aggregate of means from these and other sources, with the balance on hand on the 1st of January last, has been applied to the payment of appropriations by Congress. The whole expenditure for the year on their account, including the redemption of more than eight millions of Treasury notes, constitutes an aggregate of about $40,000,000, and will still leave in the Treasury the balance before stated. 
Nearly $8,000,000 of Treasury notes are to be paid during the coming year in addition to the ordinary appropriations for the support of Government. For both these purposes the resources of the Treasury will undoubtedly be sufficient if the charges upon it are not increased beyond the annual estimates. No excess, however, is likely to exist. Nor can the postponed installment of the surplus revenue be deposited with the States nor any considerable appropriations beyond the estimates be made without causing a deficiency in the Treasury. The great caution, advisable at all times, of limiting appropriations to the wants of the public service is rendered necessary at present by the prospective and rapid reduction of the tariff, while the vigilant jealousy evidently excited among the people by the occurrences of the last few years assures us that they expect from their representatives, and will sustain them in the exercise of, the most rigid economy. Much can be effected by postponing appropriations not immediately required for the ordinary public service or for any pressing emergency, and much by reducing the expenditures where the entire and immediate accomplishment of the objects in view is not indispensable. 
When we call to mind the recent and extreme embarrassments produced by excessive issues of bank paper, aggravated by the unforeseen withdrawal of much foreign capital and the inevitable derangement arising from the distribution of the surplus revenue among the States as required by Congress, and consider the heavy expenses incurred by the removal of Indian tribes, by the military operations in Florida, and on account of the unusually large appropriations made at the last two annual sessions of Congress for other objects, we have striking evidence in the present efficient state of our finances of the abundant resources of the country to fulfill all its obligations. Nor is it less gratifying to find that the general business of the community, deeply affected as it has been, is reviving with additional vigor, chastened by the lessons of the past and animated by the hopes of the future. By the curtailment of paper issues, by curbing the sanguine and adventurous spirit of speculation, and by the honorable application of all available means to the fulfillment of obligations, confidence has been restored both at home and abroad, and ease and facility secured to all the operations of trade. 
The agency of the Government in producing these results has been as efficient as its powers and means permitted. By withholding from the States the deposit of the fourth installment, and leaving several millions at long credits with the banks, principally in one section of the country, and more immediately beneficial to it, and at the same time aiding the banks and commercial communities in other sections by postponing the payment of bonds for duties to the amount of between four and five millions of dollars; by an issue of Treasury notes as a means to enable the Government to meet the consequences of their indulgences, but affording at the same time facilities for remittance and exchange; and by steadily declining to employ as general depositories of the public revenues, or receive the notes of, all banks which refused to redeem them with specie--by these measures, aided by the favorable action of some of the banks and by the support and cooperation of a large portion of the community, we have witnessed an early resumption of specie payments in our great commercial capital, promptly followed in almost every part of the United States. This result has been alike salutary to the true interests of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures; to public morals, respect for the laws, and that confidence between man and man which is so essential in all our social relations. 
The contrast between the suspension of 1814 and that of 1837 is most striking. The short duration of the latter, the prompt restoration of business, the evident benefits resulting from an adherence by the Government to the constitutional standard of value instead of sanctioning the suspension by the receipt of irredeemable paper, and the advantages derived from the large amount of specie introduced into the country previous to 1837 afford a valuable illustration of the true policy of the Government in such a crisis. Nor can the comparison fail to remove the impression that a national bank is necessary in such emergencies. Not only were specie payments resumed without its aid, but exchanges have also been more rapidly restored than when it existed, thereby showing that private capital, enterprise, and prudence are fully adequate to these ends. On all these points experience seems to have confirmed the views heretofore submitted to Congress. We have been saved the mortification of seeing the distresses of the community for the third time seized on to fasten upon the country so dangerous an institution, and we may also hope that the business of individuals will hereafter be relieved from the injurious effects of a continued agitation of that disturbing subject. The limited influence of a national bank in averting derangement in the exchanges of the country or in compelling the resumption of specie payments is now not less apparent than its tendency to increase inordinate speculation by sudden expansions and contractions; its disposition to create panic and embarrassment for the promotion of its own designs; its interference with politics, and its far greater power for evil than for good, either in regard to the local institutions or the operations of Government itself. What was in these respects but apprehension or opinion when a national bank was first established now stands confirmed by humiliating experience. The scenes through which we have passed conclusively prove how little our commerce, agriculture, manufactures, or finances require such an institution, and what dangers are attendant on its power--a power, I trust, never to be conferred by the American people upon their Government, and still less upon individuals not responsible to them for its unavoidable abuses. 
My conviction of the necessity of further legislative provisions for the safe-keeping and disbursement of the public moneys and my opinion in regard to the measures best adapted to the accomplishment of those objects have been already submitted to you. These have been strengthened by recent events, and in the full conviction that time and experience must still further demonstrate their propriety I feel it my duty, with respectful deference to the conflicting views of others, again to invite your attention to them. 
With the exception of limited sums deposited in the few banks still employed under the act of 1836, the amounts received for duties, and, with very inconsiderable exceptions, those accruing from lands also, have since the general suspension of specie payments by the deposit banks been kept and disbursed by the Treasurer under his general legal powers, subject to the superintendence of the Secretary of the Treasury. The propriety of defining more specifically and of regulating by law the exercise of this wide scope of Executive discretion has been already submitted to Congress. 
A change in the office of collector at one of our principal ports has brought to light a defalcation of the gravest character, the particulars of which will be laid before you in a special report from the Secretary of the Treasury. By his report and the accompanying documents it will be seen that the weekly returns of the defaulting officer apparently exhibited throughout a faithful administration of the affairs intrusted to his management. It, however, now appears that he commenced abstracting the public moneys shortly after his appointment and continued to do so, progressively increasing the amount, for the term of more than seven years, embracing a portion of the period during which the public moneys were deposited in the Bank of the United States, the whole of that of the State bank deposit system, and concluding only on his retirement from office, after that system had substantially failed in consequence of the suspension of specie payments. 
The way in which this defalcation was so long concealed and the steps taken to indemnify the United States, as far as practicable, against loss will also be presented to you. The ease is one which imperatively claims the attention of Congress and furnishes the strongest motive for the establishment of a more severe and secure system for the safe-keeping -and disbursement of the public moneys than any that has heretofore existed. 
It seems proper, at all events, that by an early enactment similar to that of other countries the application of public money by an officer of Government to private uses should be made a felony and visited with severe and ignominious punishment. This is already in effect the law in respect to the Mint, and has been productive of the most salutary results. Whatever system is adopted, such an enactment would be wise as an independent measure, since much of the public moneys must in their collection and ultimate disbursement pass twice through the hands of public officers, in whatever manner they are intermediately kept. The Government, it must be admitted, has been from its commencement comparatively fortunate in this respect. But the appointing power can not always be well advised in its selections, and the experience of every country has shown that public officers are not at all times proof against temptation. It is a duty, therefore, which the Government owes, as well to the interests committed to its care as to the officers themselves, to provide every guard against transgressions of this character that is consistent with reason and humanity. Congress can not be too jealous of the conduct of those who are intrusted with the public money, and I shall at all times be disposed to encourage a watchful discharge of this duty. 
If a more direct cooperation on the part of Congress in the supervision of the conduct of the officers intrusted with the custody and application of the public money is deemed desirable, it will give me pleasure to assist in the establishment of any judicious and constitutional plan by which that object may be accomplished. You will in your wisdom determine upon the propriety of adopting such a plan and upon the measures necessary to its effectual execution. When the late Bank of the United States was incorporated and made the depository of the public moneys, a right was reserved to Congress to inspect at its pleasure, by a committee of that body, the books and the proceedings of the bank. In one of the States, whose banking institutions are supposed to rank amongst the first in point of stability, they are subjected to constant examination by commissioners appointed for that purpose, and much of the success of its banking system is attributed to this watchful supervision. 
The same course has also, in view of its beneficial operation, been adopted by an adjoining State, favorably known for the care it has always bestowed upon whatever relates to its financial concerns. I submit to your consideration whether a committee of Congress might not be profitably employed in inspecting, at such intervals as might be deemed proper, the affairs and accounts of officers intrusted with the custody of the public moneys. The frequent performance of this duty might be made obligatory on the committee in respect to those officers who have large sums in their possession, and left discretionary in respect to others. They might report to the Executive such defalcations as were found to exist, with a view to a prompt removal from office unless the default was satisfactorily accounted for, and report also to Congress, at the commencement of each session, the result of their examinations and proceedings. It does appear to me that with a subjection of this class of public officers to the general supervision of the Executive, to examinations by a committee of Congress at periods of which they should have no previous notice, and to prosecution and punishment as for felony for every breach of trust, the safe-keeping of the public moneys might under the system proposed be placed on a surer foundation than it has ever occupied since the establishment of the Government. 
The Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you additional information containing new details on this interesting subject. To these I ask your early attention. That it should have given rise to great diversity of opinion can not be a subject of surprise. After the collection and custody of the public moneys had been for so many years connected with and made subsidiary to the advancement of private interests, a return to the simple self-denying ordinances of the Constitution could not but be difficult. But time and free discussion, eliciting the sentiments of the people, and aided by that conciliatory spirit which has ever characterized their course on great emergencies, were relied upon for a satisfactory settlement of the question. Already has this anticipation, on one important point at least--the impropriety of diverting public money to private purposes--been fully realized. There is no reason to suppose that legislation upon that branch of the subject would now be embarrassed by a difference of opinion, or fail to receive the cordial support of a large majority of our constituents. 
The connection which formerly existed between the Government and banks was in reality injurious to both, as well as to the general interests of the community at large. It aggravated the disasters of trade and the derangements of commercial intercourse, and administered new excitements and additional means to wild and reckless speculations, the disappointment of which threw the country into convulsions of panic, and all but produced violence and bloodshed. The imprudent expansion of bank credits, which was the natural result of the command of the revenues of the State, furnished the resources for unbounded license in every species of adventure, seduced industry from its regular and salutary occupations by the hope of abundance without labor, and deranged the social state by tempting all trades and professions into the vortex of speculation on remote contingencies. 
The same wide-spreading influence impeded also the resources of the Government, curtailed its useful operations, embarrassed the fulfillment of its obligations, and seriously interfered with the execution of the laws. Large appropriations and oppressive taxes are the natural consequences of such a connection, since they increase the profits of those who are allowed to use the public funds, and make it their interest that money should be accumulated and expenditures multiplied. It is thus that a concentrated money power is tempted to become an active agent in political affairs; and all past experience has shown on which side that influence will be arrayed. We deceive ourselves if we suppose that, it will ever be found asserting and supporting the rights of the community at large in opposition to the claims of the few. 
In a government whose distinguishing characteristic should be a diffusion and equalization of its benefits and burdens the advantage of individuals will be augmented at the expense of the community at large. Nor is it the nature of combinations for the acquisition of legislative influence to confine their interference to the single object for which they were originally formed. The temptation to extend it to other matters is, on the contrary, not unfrequently too strong to be resisted. The rightful influence in the direction of public affairs of the mass of the people is therefore in no slight danger of being sensibly and injuriously affected by giving to a comparatively small but very efficient class a direct and exclusive personal interest in so important a portion of the legislation of Congress as that which relates to the custody of the public moneys. If laws acting upon private interests can not always be avoided, they should be confined within the narrowest limits, and left wherever possible to the legislatures of the States. When not thus restricted they lead to combinations of powerful associations, foster an influence necessarily selfish, and turn the fair course of legislation to sinister ends rather than to objects that advance public liberty and promote the general good. 
The whole subject now rests with you, and I can not but express a hope that some definite measure will be adopted at the present session. 
It will not, I am sure, be deemed out of place for me here to remark that the declaration of my views in opposition to the policy of employing banks as depositories of the Government funds can not justly be construed as indicative of hostility, official or personal, to those institutions; or to repeat in this form and in connection with this subject opinions which I have uniformly entertained and on all proper occasions expressed. Though always opposed to their creation in the form of exclusive privileges, and, as a State magistrate, aiming by appropriate legislation to secure the community against the consequences of their occasional mismanagement, I have yet ever wished to see them protected in the exercise of rights conferred by law, and have never doubted their utility when properly managed in promoting the interests of trade, and through that channel the other interests of the community. To the General Government they present themselves merely as State institutions, having no necessary connection with its legislation or its administration. Like other State establishments, they may be used or not in conducting the affairs of the Government, as public policy and the general interests of the Union may seem to require. The only safe or proper principle upon which their intercourse with the Government can be regulated is that which regulates their intercourse with the private citizen--the conferring of mutual benefits. When the Government can accomplish a financial operation better with the aid of the banks than without it, it should be at liberty to seek that aid as it would the services of a private banker or other capitalist or agent, giving the preference to those who will serve it on the best terms. Nor can there ever exist an interest in the officers of the General Government, as such, inducing them to embarrass or annoy the State banks any more than to incur the hostility of any other class of State institutions or of private citizens. It is not in the nature of things that hostility to these institutions can spring from this source, or any opposition to their course of business, except when they themselves depart from the objects of their creation and attempt to usurp powers not conferred upon them or to subvert the standard of value established by the Constitution. While opposition to their regular operations can not exist in this quarter, resistance to any attempt to make the Government dependent upon them for the successful administration of public affairs is a matter of duty, as I trust it ever will be of inclination, no matter from what motive or consideration the attempt may originate. 
It is no more than just to the banks to say that in the late emergency most of them firmly resisted the strongest temptations to extend their paper issues when apparently sustained in a suspension of specie payments by public opinion, even though in some cases invited by legislative enactments. To this honorable course, aided by the resistance of the General Government, acting in obedience to the Constitution and laws of the United States, to the introduction of an irredeemable paper medium, may be attributed in a great degree the speedy restoration of our currency to a sound state and the business of the country to its wonted prosperity. 
The banks have but to continue in the same safe course and be content in their appropriate sphere to avoid all interference from the General Government and to derive from it all the protection and benefits which it bestows on other State establishments, on the people of the States, and on the States themselves. In this, their true position, they can not but secure the confidence and good will of the people and the Government, which they can only lose when, leaping from their legitimate sphere, they attempt to control the legislation of the country and pervert the operations of the Government to their own purposes. 
Our experience under the act, passed at the last session, to grant preemption rights to settlers on the public lands has as yet been too limited to enable us to pronounce with safety upon the efficacy of its provisions to carry out the wise and liberal policy of the Government in that respect. There is, however, the best reason to anticipate favorable results from its operation. The recommendations formerly submitted to you in respect to a graduation of the price of the public lands remain to be finally acted upon. Having found no reason to change the views then expressed, your attention to them is again respectfully requested. 
Every proper exertion has been made and will be continued to carry out the wishes of Congress in relation to the tobacco trade, as indicated in the several resolutions of the House of Representatives and the legislation of the two branches. A favorable impression has, I trust, been made in the different foreign countries to which particular attention has been directed; and although we can not hope for an early change in their policy, as in many of them a convenient and large revenue is derived from monopolies in the fabrication and sale of this article, yet, as these monopolies are really injurious to the people where they are established, and the revenue derived from them may be less injuriously and with equal facility obtained from another and a liberal system of administration, we can not doubt that our efforts will be eventually crowned with, success if persisted in with temperate firmness and sustained by prudent legislation. 
In recommending to Congress the adoption of the necessary provisions at this session for taking the next census or enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States, the suggestion presents itself whether the scope of the measure might not be usefully extended by causing it to embrace authentic statistical returns of the great interests specially intrusted to or necessarily affected by the legislation of Congress. 
The accompanying report of the Secretary of War presents a satisfactory account of the state of the Army and of the several branches of the public service confided to the superintendence of that officer. 
The law increasing and organizing the military establishment of the United States has been nearly carried into effect, and the Army has been extensively and usefully employed during the past season. 
I would again call to your notice the subjects connected with and essential to the military defenses of the country which were submitted to you at the last session, but which were not acted upon, as is supposed, for want of time. The most important of them is the organization of the militia on the maritime and inland frontiers. This measure is deemed important, as it is believed that it will furnish an effective volunteer force in aid of the Regular Army, and may form the basis of a general system of organization for the entire militia of the United States. The erection of a national foundry and gunpowder manufactory, and one for making small arms, the latter to be situated at some point west of the Allegany Mountains, all appear to be of sufficient importance to be again urged upon your attention. 
The plan proposed by the Secretary of War for the distribution of the forces of the United States in time of peace is well calculated to promote regularity and economy in the fiscal administration of the service, to preserve the discipline of the troops, and to render them available for the maintenance of the peace and tranquillity of the Country. With this view, likewise, I recommend the adoption of the plan presented by that officer for the defense of the western frontier. The preservation of the lives and property of our fellow-citizens who are settled upon that border country, as well as the existence of the Indian population, which might be tempted by our want of preparation to rush on their own destruction and attack the white settlements, all seem to require that this subject should be acted upon without delay, and the War Department authorized to place that country in a state of complete defense against any assault from the numerous and warlike tribes which are congregated on that border. 
It affords me sincere pleasure to be able to apprise you of the entire removal of the Cherokee Nation of Indians to their new homes west of the Mississippi. The measures authorized by Congress at its last session, with a view to the long-standing controversy with them, have had the happiest effects. By an agreement concluded with them by the commanding general in that country, who has performed the duties assigned to him on the occasion with commendable energy and humanity, their removal has been principally under the conduct of their own chiefs, and they have emigrated without any apparent reluctance. 
The successful accomplishment of this important object, the removal also of the entire Creek Nation with the exception of a small number of fugitives amongst the Seminoles in Florida, the progress already made toward a speedy completion of the removal of the Chickasaws, the Choctaws, the Pottawatamies, the Ottawas, and the Chippewas, with the extensive purchases of Indian lands during the present year, have rendered the speedy and successful result of the long-established policy of the Government upon the subject of Indian affairs entirely certain. The occasion is therefore deemed a proper one to place this policy in such a point of view as will exonerate the Government of the United States from the undeserved reproach which has been cast upon it through several successive Administrations. That a mixed occupancy of the same territory by the white and red man is incompatible with the safety or happiness of either is a position in respect to which there has long since ceased to be room for a difference of opinion. Reason and experience have alike demonstrated its impracticability. The bitter fruits of every attempt heretofore to overcome the barriers interposed by nature have only been destruction, both physical and moral, to the Indian, dangerous conflicts of authority between the Federal and State Governments, and detriment to the individual prosperity of the citizen as well as to the general improvement of the country. The remedial policy, the principles of which were settled more than thirty years ago under the Administration of Mr. Jefferson, consists in an extinction, for a fair consideration, of the title to all the lands still occupied by the Indians within the States and Territories of the United States; their removal to a country west of the Mississippi much more extensive and better adapted to their condition than that on which they then resided; the guarantee to them by the United States of their exclusive possession of that country forever, exempt from all intrusions by white men, with ample provisions for their security against external violence and internal dissensions, and the extension to them of suitable facilities for their advancement in civilization. This has not been the policy of particular Administrations only, but of each in succession since the first attempt to carry it out under that of Mr. Monroe. All have labored for its accomplishment, only with different degrees of success. The manner of its execution has, it is true, from time to time given rise to conflicts of opinion and unjust imputations; but in respect to the wisdom and necessity of the policy itself there has not from the beginning existed a doubt in the mind of any calm, judicious, disinterested friend of the Indian race accustomed to reflection and enlightened by experience. 
Occupying the double character of contractor on its own account and guardian for the parties contracted with, it was hardly to be expected that the dealings of the Federal Government with the Indian tribes would escape misrepresentation. That there occurred ill the early settlement of this country, as in all others where the civilized race has succeeded to the possessions of the savage, instances of oppression and fraud on the part of the former there is too much reason to believe. No such offenses can, however, be justly charged upon this Government since it became free to pursue its own course. Its dealings with the Indian tribes have been just .and friendly throughout; its efforts for their civilization constant, and directed by the best feelings of humanity; its watchfulness in protecting them from individual frauds unremitting; its forbearance under the keenest provocations, the deepest injuries, and the most flagrant outrages may challenge at least a comparison with any nation, ancient or modern, in similar circumstances; and if in future times a powerful, civilized, and happy nation of Indians shall be found to exist within the limits of this northern continent it will be owing to the consummation of that policy which has been so unjustly assailed. Only a very brief reference to facts in confirmation of this assertion can in this form be given, and you are therefore necessarily referred to the report of the Secretary of War for further details. To the Cherokees, whose case has perhaps excited the greatest share of attention and sympathy, the United States have granted in fee, with a perpetual guaranty of exclusive and peaceable possession, 13,554,135 acres of land on the west side of the Mississippi, eligibly situated, in a healthy climate, and in all respects better suited to their condition than the country they have left, in exchange for only 9,492, 160 acres on the east side of the same river. The United States have in addition stipulated to pay them $5,600,000 for their interest in and improvements on the lands thus relinquished, and $1,160,000 for subsistence and other beneficial purposes, thereby putting it in their power to become one of the most wealthy and independent separate communities of the same extent in the world. 
By the treaties made and ratified with the Miamies, the Chippewas, the Sioux, the Sacs and Foxes, and the Winnebagoes during the last year the Indian title to 18,458,000 acres has been extinguished. These purchases have been much more extensive than those of any previous year, and have, with other Indian expenses, borne very heavily upon the Treasury. They leave, however, but a small quantity of unbought Indian lands within the States and Territories, and the Legislature and Executive were equally sensible of the propriety of a final and more speedy extinction of Indian titles within those limits. The treaties, which were with a single exception made in pursuance of previous appropriations for defraying the expenses, have subsequently been ratified by the Senate, and received the sanction of Congress by the appropriations necessary to carry them into effect. Of the terms upon which these important negotiations were concluded I can speak from direct knowledge, and I feel no difficulty in affirming that the interest of the Indians in the extensive territory embraced by them is to be paid for at its fair value, and that no more favorable terms have been granted to the United States than would have been reasonably expected in a negotiation with civilized men fully capable of appreciating and protecting their own rights. For the Indian title to 116,349,897 acres acquired since the 4th of March, 1829, the United States have paid $72,560,056 in permanent annuities, lands, reservations for Indians, expenses of removal and subsistence, merchandise, mechanical and agricultural establishments and implements. When the heavy expenses incurred by the United States and the circumstance that so large a portion of the entire territory will be forever unsalable are considered, and this price is compared with that for which the United States sell their own lands, no one can doubt that justice has been done to the Indians in these purchases also. Certain it is that the transactions of the Federal Government with the Indians have been uniformly characterized by a sincere and paramount desire to promote their welfare; and it must be a source of the highest gratification to every friend to justice and humanity to learn that not withstanding the obstructions from time to time thrown in its way and the difficulties which have arisen from the peculiar and impracticable nature of the Indian character, the wise, humane, and undeviating policy of the Government in this the most difficult of all our relations, foreign or domestic, has at length been justified to the world in its near approach to a happy and certain consummation. 
The condition of the tribes which occupy the country set apart for them in the West is highly prosperous, and encourages the hope of their early civilization. They have for the most part abandoned the hunter state and turned their attention to agricultural pursuits. All those who have been established for any length of time in that fertile region maintain themselves by their own industry. There are among them traders of no inconsiderable capital, and planters exporting cotton to some extent, but the greater number are small agriculturists, living in comfort upon the produce of their farms. The recent emigrants, although they have in some instances removed reluctantly, have readily acquiesced in their unavoidable destiny. They have found at once a recompense for past sufferings and an incentive to industrious habits in the abundance and comforts around them. There is reason to believe that all these tribes are friendly in their feelings toward the United States; and it is to be hoped that the acquisition of individual wealth, the pursuits of agriculture, and habits of industry will gradually subdue their warlike propensities and incline them to maintain peace among themselves. To effect this desirable object the attention of Congress is solicited to the measures recommended by the Secretary of War for their future government and protection, as well from each other as from the hostility of the warlike tribes around them and the intrusions of the whites. The policy of the Government has given them a permanent home and guaranteed to them its peaceful and undisturbed possession. It only remains to give them a government and laws which will encourage industry and secure to them the rewards of their exertions. The importance of some form of government can not be too much insisted upon. The earliest effects will be to diminish the causes and occasions for hostilities among the tribes, to inspire an interest in the observance of laws to which they will have themselves assented, and to multiply the securities of property and the motives for self-improvement. Intimately connected with this subject is the establishment of the military defenses recommended by the Secretary of War, which have been already referred to. Without them the Government will be powerless to redeem its pledge of protection to the emigrating Indians against the numerous warlike tribes that surround them and to provide for the safety of the frontier settlers of the bordering States. 
The case of the Seminoles constitutes at present the only exception to the successful efforts of the Government to remove the Indians to the homes assigned them west of the Mississippi. Four hundred of this tribe emigrated in 1836 and 1,500 in 1837 and 1838, leaving in the country, it is supposed, about 2,000 Indians. The continued treacherous conduct of these people; the savage and unprovoked murders they have lately committed, butchering whole families of the settlers of the Territory without distinction of age or sex, and making their way into the very center and heart of the country, so that no part of it is free from their ravages; their frequent attacks on the light-houses along that dangerous coast, and the barbarity with which they have murdered the passengers and crews of such vessels as have been wrecked upon the reefs and keys which border the Gulf, leave the Government no alternative but to continue the military operations against them until they are totally expelled from Florida. There are other motives which would urge the Government to pursue this course toward the Seminoles. The United States have fulfilled in good faith all their treaty stipulations with the Indian tribes, and have in every other instance insisted upon a like performance of their obligations. To relax from this salutary rule because the Seminoles have maintained themselves so long in the territory they had relinquished, and in defiance of their frequent and solemn engagements still continue to wage a ruthless war against the United States, would not only evince a want of constancy on our part, but be of evil example in our intercourse with other tribes. Experience has shown that but little is to be gained by the march of armies through a country so intersected with inaccessible swamps and marshes, and which, from the fatal character of the climate, must be abandoned at the end of the winter. I recommend, therefore, to your attention the plan submitted by the Secretary of War in the accompanying report, for the permanent occupation of the portion of the Territory freed from the Indians and the more efficient protection of the people of Florida from their inhuman warfare. 
From the report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith transmitted it will appear that a large portion of the disposable naval force is either actively employed or in a state of preparation for the purposes of experience and discipline and the protection. of our commerce. So effectual has been this protection that so far as the information of Government extends not a single outrage has been attempted on a vessel carrying the flag of the United States within the present year, in any quarter, however distant or exposed. 
The exploring expedition sailed from Norfolk on the 19th of August last, and information has been received of its safe arrival at the island of Madeira. The best spirit animates the officers and crews, and there is every reason to anticipate from its efforts results beneficial to commerce and honorable to the nation. 
It will also be seen that no reduction of the force now in commission is contemplated. The unsettled state of a portion of South America renders it indispensable that our commerce should receive protection in that quarter; the vast and increasing interests embarked in the trade of the Indian and China seas, in the whale fisheries of the Pacific Ocean, and in the Gulf of Mexico require equal attention to their safety, and a small squadron may be employed to great advantage on our Atlantic coast in meeting sudden demands for the reenforcement of other stations, in aiding merchant vessels in distress, in affording active service to an additional number of officers, and in visiting the different ports of the United States, an accurate knowledge of which is obviously of the highest importance. 
The attention of Congress is respectfully called to that portion of the report recommending an increase in the number of smaller vessels, and to other suggestions contained in that document. The rapid increase and wide expansion of our commerce, which is every day seeking new avenues of profitable adventure; the absolute necessity of a naval force for its protection precisely in the degree of its extension; a due regard to the national rights and honor; the recollection of its former exploits, and the anticipation of its future triumphs whenever opportunity presents itself, which we may rightfully indulge from the experience of the past--all seem to point to the Navy as a most efficient arm of our national defense and a proper object of legislative encouragement. 
The progress and condition of the Post-Office Department will be seen by reference to the report of the Postmaster-General. The extent of post-roads covered by mail contracts is stated to be 134,818 miles, and the annual transportation upon them 34,580,202 miles. The number of post-offices in the United States is 12,553, and rapidly increasing. The gross revenue for the year ending on the 30th day of June last was $4,262,145; the accruing expenditures, $4,680,068; excess of expenditures, $417,923. This has been made up out of the surplus previously on hand. The cash on hand on the 1st instant was $314,068. The revenue for the year ending June 30, 1838, was $161,540 more than that for the year ending June 30, 1837. The expenditures of the Department had been graduated upon the anticipation of a largely increased revenue. A moderate curtailment of mail service consequently became necessary, and has been effected, to shield the Department against the danger of embarrassment. Its revenue is now improving, and it will soon resume its onward course in the march of improvement. 
Your particular attention is requested to so much of the Postmaster-Generals report as relates to the transportation of the mails upon railroads. The laws on that subject do not seem adequate to secure that service, now become almost essential to the public interests, and at the same time protect the Department from combinations and unreasonable demands. 
Nor can I too earnestly request your attention to the necessity of providing a more secure building for this Department. The danger of destruction to which its important books and papers are continually exposed, as well from the highly combustible character of the building occupied as from that of others in the vicinity, calls loudly for prompt action. 
Your attention is again earnestly invited to the suggestions and recommendations submitted at the last session in respect to the District of Columbia. 
I feel it my duty also to bring to your notice certain proceedings at law which have recently been prosecuted in this District in the name of the United States, on the relation of Messrs. Stockton & Stokes, of the State of Maryland, against the Postmaster-General, and which have resulted in the payment of money out of the National Treasury, for the first time since the establishment of the Government, by judicial compulsion exercised by the common-law writ of mandamus issued by the circuit court of this District. 
The facts of the case and the grounds of the proceedings will be found fully stated in the report of the decision, and any additional information which you may desire will be supplied by the proper Department. No interference in the particular case is contemplated. The money has been paid, the claims of the prosecutors have been satisfied, and the whole subject, so far as they are concerned, is finally disposed of; but it is on the supposition that the case may be regarded as an authoritative exposition of the law as it now stands that I have thought it necessary to present it to your consideration. 
The object of the application to the circuit court was to compel the Postmaster-General to carry into effect an award made by the Solicitor of the Treasury, under a special act of Congress for the settlement of certain claims of the relators on the Post-Office Department, which award the Postmaster-General declined to execute in full until he should receive further legislative direction on the subject. If the duty imposed on the Postmaster-General by that law was to be regarded as one of an official nature, belonging to his office as a branch of the executive, then it is obvious that the constitutional competency of the judiciary to direct and control him in its discharge was necessarily drawn in question; and if the duty so imposed on the Postmaster-General was to be considered as merely ministerial, and not executive, it yet remained to be shown that the circuit court of this District had authority to interfere by mandamus, such a power having never before been asserted or claimed by that court. With a view to the settlement of these important questions, the judgment of the circuit court was carried by a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the opinion of that tribunal the duty imposed on the Postmaster-General was not an official executive duty, but one of a merely ministerial nature. The grave constitutional questions which had been discussed were therefore excluded from the decision of the case, the court, indeed, expressly admitting that with powers and duties properly belonging to the executive no other department can inter-fere by the writ of mandamus; and the question therefore resolved itself into this: Has Congress conferred upon the circuit court of this District the power to issue such a writ to an officer of the General Government commanding him to perform a ministerial act? A majority of the court have decided that it has, but have rounded their decision upon a process of reasoning which in my judgment renders further legislative provision indispensable to the public interests and the equal administration of justice. 
It has long since been decided by the Supreme Court that neither that tribunal nor the circuit courts of the United States, held within the respective States, possess the power in question; but it is now held that this power, denied to both of these high tribunals (to the former by the Constitution and to the latter by Congress), has been by its legislation vested in the circuit court of this District. No such direct grant of power to the circuit court of this District is claimed, but it has been held to result by necessary implication from several sections of the law establishing the court. One of these sections declares that the laws of Maryland, as they existed at the time of the cession, should be in force in that part of the District ceded by that State, and by this provision the common law in civil and criminal cases, as it prevailed in Maryland in 1801, was established in that part of the District. 
Admitting that the adoption of the laws of Maryland for a portion of this District confers on the circuit court thereof, in that portion, the transcendent extrajudicial prerogative powers of the court of king's bench in England, or that either of the acts of Congress by necessary implication authorizes the former court to issue a writ of mandamus to an officer of the United States to compel him to perform a ministerial duty, the consequences are in one respect the same. The result in either case is that the officers of the United States stationed in different parts of the United States are, in respect to the performance of their official duties, subject to different laws and a different supervision--those in the States to one rule, and those in the District of Columbia to another and a very different one. In the District their official conduct is subject to a judicial control from which in the States they are exempt. 
Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the expediency of vesting such a power in the judiciary in a system of government constituted like that of the United States, all must agree that these disparaging discrepancies in the law and in the administration of justice ought not to he permitted to continue; and as Congress alone can provide the remedy, the subject is unavoidably presented to your consideration. 
"
Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much. It's an honor to be with Prime Minister May. We've had a great discussion. We're on the same wavelength in, I think, every respect.
The Prime Minister and myself have had a really great relationship, although some people don't necessarily believe that. But I can tell you it's true. I have tremendous respect for the Prime Minister and the job she's doing.
And I think the feeling is mutual from the standpoint of liking each other a lot. And so that was a little bit of a false rumor out there. I just wanted to correct it, frankly, because we have great respect for everything you're doing. And we love your country because it's truly great.
And we're working on transactions, in terms of economic development, trade, maybe most importantly, military. And we are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military. We have the same ideas, the same ideals, and there's nothing that would happen to you that we won't be there to fight for you. You know that. And I just want to thank you very much. This is a great honor to be with you. Thank you very much.
Good. Well, it's great to see you. One thing that will be taking place over a number of years will be trade. The trade is going to increase many times, and we look forward to that.
But the trade concepts and discussions -- and the discussions, really, I think can say, most importantly that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increases in trade between our two countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. And we look forward to that, and we are starting that process pretty much as we speak. So thank you all very much for being here. Thank you.
When will be -- what? State?
We will talk about it.
We're going to be talking about it.
"
Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much. I’m honored to be here with many of the great American workers as we take historic action to accelerate the incredible revival of American manufacturing. It truly is a revival. Nobody thought it was possible, actually. And not only is it possible, but we’re thriving. We’re also grateful to be joined by Secretary Acosta, Administrator McMahon, and Representative Robert Aderholt, Mario Diaz-Balart.
And we're working on a lot of interesting projects in your neck of the woods, aren’t we, huh? How’s that all going?
I didn’t expect that. I never told him to say that. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Robert Aderholt. Robert, thank you very much. David Joyce, Anthony Gonzalez, and David Rouzer.
Thank you all for being here. We really worked hard on this. And I appreciate your support. In the eight years before I took office, we lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. They were leaving. People were talking about the fact that you needed a magic wand; you’ll never bring them back. You remember the previous administration, he said that they said -- he said -- they all said you needed a magic wand; manufacturing jobs were over.
I guess you people heard that too. It was a little bit discouraging. And since the election, we’ve gained more than 500,000 jobs -- and that number is going to be very soon to 700,000 jobs -- all in the manufacturing world, which is a beautiful world, a high-paying world, and very important for our country.
Last year, we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing employment in more than 20 years. Early in my presidency, I issued an executive order directing the federal government to live by two very crucial rules: Buy American and hire American. And I think that sounds appropriate. Remember in the old days? It was not that.
It was almost the opposite. You’d say, “Where are they coming from?” Thanks to my executive order and a really great group of people, we have increased reliance on American-made goods very, very substantially. Federal agencies are now spending an additional $24 billion on American-made products instead of going to other countries or foreign-made products.
Federal spending on foreign goods is now the lowest it’s been in more than 10 years, and it’s going down very substantially. And, by the way, we don’t get treated great by many countries in terms of our trade deals, and that’s changing rapidly. But we are now looking out a little bit for ourselves and it’s about time.
Today, I’m taking action to build on this tremendous success by strengthening the Buy American principle for federal infrastructure and federal spending. We want American roads, bridges, and railways, and everything else to be built with American iron, American steel, American concrete, and American hands.
And if you look at what’s happened with the steel industry, it’s actually amazing. The steel industry is thriving now and it was dead when I came to office. It was dead. It was a dead industry. They were dumping steel all over the place. The jobs were going. And if any of you were in the steel industry, I think you can probably tell them, you know.
And aluminum, too. But when you look at what’s happened to the steel industry, it’s been incredible. One of the great successes. And now prices are starting to come down because they’re competing with each other. Nucor and U.S. Steel and so many of these companies, they’re building many, many plants all over the United States.
And as those plants open, they’re finally competing with themselves. We literally were not going to have steel companies. We weren’t going to make steel in this country. And that in itself is a very important thing. We have to have steel. There are some products you have to have. And, by the way, steel is one of them.
You talked about defense -- how do you do it without steel and aluminum and the kinds of things that we're really very heavily focused on. By signing this order today, we renew our commitment to an essential truth: It matters where something is made, and it matters very greatly. When I came to office, and I witnessed for many years -- for decades, frankly -- they didn’t care where it was made.
I care where it’s made. It should be made right here in the USA. And we’ve taken a very strong stand. I want to introduce, before I sign, Peter Navarro and Kevin Hassett, two of my great economic people. And they’re going to give you a little talk as to what’s happened and how good we’re doing.
Peter, do you want to start?
Wow. That's fantastic.
Well, you know, Kevin, when I took over, the Rust Belt was really in trouble. Many people were saying it’s dying, it’s dead; people were leaving. And I love the Rust Belt, and the Rust Belt is no longer the Rust Belt as far as I’m concerned. It’s vibrant. It’s doing so well. You look at all of those red marks, those red marks are where it’s flourishing.
Tremendous numbers. And that’s fantastic. We’re very proud. I wish, frankly, that the media would report how well we’re doing in manufacturing, how well we’re doing with the economy. They don’t seem to report how well we’re doing. I think if you had another President, it would be the biggest story, because it really is the biggest story, or certainly one of the biggest stories.
And you see the market, how it is. It hit 25,000 yesterday. We’re doing great. We’re doing great as a country. And we have a lot of bite-back because other countries are not doing well. China is having a very hard time. They’re here now. We’re going to be seeing them a little bit later. We’re trying to work out a new trade deal with China.
I think it will happen. Something will happen. But it’s a very big deal. It will be -- if it does happen, it will be, by far, the largest trade deal ever made. And we essentially didn’t have a trade deal with China. We lost $500 billion with China, for many years, a year. Anywhere from $300- to $500-, $505 billion a year was lost in our dealing with China.
And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and I think we’ll sit down at the end -- at the end of the negotiation by our representatives -- and do something with respect to making a deal with China. I think it has a very good chance of happening. But China is having a very hard time with their economy, and the European Union is having a hard time.
A lot of things going on. And we’re getting tremendous numbers. Tremendous unemployment numbers -- among the best we’ve ever had in the history of our country. Individual groups the best: African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women. Numbers that we haven’t seen before. The overall is the best numbers.
Best employment numbers in 51 years. So we're doing really well. I wish the press would report it. I'm going to sign this. Before I do, I think I want to just ask a few of you folks, would you like to say something? Anybody.
Thank you very much. That was great. Charlie? That was great.
Yeah. We're changing that fast.
Big difference. Big difference.
That's great. Great group. Thank you. Thank you all very much. You want to say anything? Anybody else? Anybody want to become a congressperson?
Big difference. Right?
Thank you all very much. So how about our politicians? Now, they want to say, that I know.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
That’s why he wins by so much.
That's why he doesn’t worry too much about races. You know? Just wins.
I think I did very well.
That’s great. That's very nice. Thank you very much. Say hello. Linda?
Great job you're doing too. She runs the Small Business, and they're big business when you add it all up. She's done a fantastic job -- Linda McMahon. Mr. Secretary?
It's having an incredible effect. I mean, people don’t realize it yet, but they're seeing it more and more. We are mandating even pipelines and things that were made elsewhere. They're starting to be made here because we have a steel industry again. But it's having a tremendous effect. Please.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
So China, as you know, has opened up because of us to the financial services industry, which is a big thing. Nobody thought that was possible. And they've opened up to financial services and things of the like. But I just want to let everyone know we won't have a deal if we don’t open it up to the farmers, and we won't have a deal if they don’t open it up to our manufacturers, and just all of it. And I think China is very prone to do this.
So we're going to have a talk. But we've already got financial services. A big impact. You have tremendous amounts of money. Tremendous amounts of people. It's a whole different market, and a massive market. I guess you could certainly say the biggest, or one of the biggest markets in the world, but maybe the biggest market in a certain way in the world.
But we're the number-one country in the world economically. I don’t want people to forget that. We're the number one. And we were heading -- we were heading south fast. We were going down, and we turned it around. And it started with the regulations that we cut. We cut more regulations than any administration in the history of our country in two years.
And, actually, less than two years. And it also was helped by the tax cuts. Put a lot of people to work and really gave companies something where they're now coming back into our country, they're investing in our country, and they're expanding in our country. So, a lot of great things are happening. Mario?
Thank you. I'm liking this guy more and more.
I know. Reciprocal trade is going be very important. We're going putting in a bill very soon, where when a country charges us tariffs that are massive, and we charge them nothing for the same exact product, we just say, ""Hey, got to be equal. You charge us, we charge you."" You could call it a reciprocal tax, but some people call it a mirror tax.
So, if Europe, as an example -- the EU charges us 72 percent tariff on corn, and they don’t even want it, and we charge them nothing -- it doesn’t work that way anymore. So, you know, I've gone to many people that aren’t that familiar with it, including politicians that you'll be dealing with soon.
And I went to a couple that are always tough. I said, ""What do you think of that? They charge us, we charge them."" They looked at me and they said, Robert, ""Huh. Sounds fair to me."" And, actually, you probably get rid of tariffs, because rather than charging 75 percent to nothing, now if you're both at 75, you say, ""Let's call it quits.
We'll go to nothing."" So it really has that impact too, as you know. Please.
Thank you.
And they're getting -- it’s a beautiful thing because I opened up, as you know -- the best iron ore, they say, virtually in the world is in Minnesota. The big mines. They were closed. President Obama decided to close them. I opened them. And we're not bringing it in; we’re taking it right from our own home.
And we're having it made in Ohio. We have good ore in Ohio, too. But we're having it made in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, and all the different places. It's been really incredible to see what's happening. We don’t need anything from outside of our own boundaries. So that’s been really great.
Okay, let's go. Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. I appreciate it.
No, I disagree with certain things that they said. I think I'm right, but time will prove that. Time will prove me right, probably. I think Iran is a threat. I think it's a very big threat. And I think I did a great thing when I terminated the ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible, one-sided deal that was $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash, and lots of other bad things.
If you remember, they took our 10 sailors out of waters that people are disputing, and made us look very bad. But, of course, the payment was due the following day, so they eventually let them go, which they had to. I disagree very much on that. I also think -- and you'll be seeing something next week -- because you look at what's happened in Syria with respect to ISIS and the caliphate.
We took over a lot of area in the last two weeks. We've done tremendous in the last couple of weeks. At the same time, we're consolidating, and a tremendous amount of good things are happening. You even look at what's going on -- and I can't tell you that this is a guarantee because we're going into close to 19 years in being in Afghanistan.
And, for the first time, they're talking about settling. They're talking about making an agreement. And we bring our people back home if that happens. We'll see what happens, but they're in very serious negotiations for the first time. There's a reason for that. So I think we're doing so well on a foreign policy basis.
If you look at North Korea -- and many of you are going to be traveling with us to North Korea and -- for the meetings with North Korea. We're going to a certain location. I think most of you know where the location is. I don't think it's any great secret. But we'll be announcing the location and the date -- the exact date.
It will be at the end of February. And we've made tremendous progress with North Korea. When I came in -- or, let's say, at the end of the last administration -- frankly, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. Now there's no missile testing. There's no rocket testing. There's no nuclear testing.
We got back our prisoners or our hostages. And we're getting back our remains; they're coming in. And we've had some beautiful ceremonies in Hawaii, other places. So I just tell you that we are doing really well. Our military is being rebuilt. It's very close to being rebuilt. We have tremendous amounts of new aircraft, new ships, new weapons of all kinds, which we need -- because, hopefully, the stronger we get, the less you have to use it. I guess you know that from growing up in school.
The stronger we are, the less we're going to have you use it, and we don't want to have to use it. But we're going to have the strongest military, by far, that we've ever had. So I didn't see the report from the intelligence. When you read it, it's a lot different than it was covered on in the news. But I think that Iran is somebody -- is a nation that we have to watch very closely.
They sent up a rocket the other day, and it failed. But it was sent up. Now, they can say they're sending it up for civilian purposes, but I don't think too many people believe that. They're doing tests. And we don't want to be in a position where we're behind. We're not going to be leading from behind anymore.
So that's the story. I have great respect for a lot of people, but I don't always agree with everybody. Okay?
So, it's great. Well, we're going to -- look, we're going to go into everything. You probably saw, this morning I put out a statement. We're going into everything. This isn't going to be a small deal with China. This is either going to be a very big deal or it's going to be a deal that we'll just postpone for a little while.
But we've been dealing with China. We've had a great relationship. I have a great relationship with President Xi. The relationship of my people to Chinese representatives has been very good. They're negotiating now. They'll be coming over here at about 4 o'clock, and we'll be talking to, actually, one of the top leaders in China, as you know.
I think that probably the final deal will be made. If it's made, will be made between myself and President Xi. But we're certainly talking about theft. We're talking about every aspect of trade with a country. And we're talking about fentanyl, too. As you know, most of the fentanyl -- which is killing 80,000 Americans a year is -- it comes through China.
And, in China, it was not criminalized. And they've agreed to criminalize fentanyl and give it the maximum penalty. The maximum penalty in China, if you're selling drugs, is death; it's the death penalty. And they've agreed to do the death penalty for selling fentanyl. And if it's shipped to the United States, that would be a very severe penalty.
So I think that's going to have a tremendous impact. We put that one item into the trade deal -- the fentanyl. I think that's a very important item to put in. But they've agreed -- they've agree, and agreed very readily -- we really appreciate it -- to criminalize the sale of fentanyl. Steve?
I don't know. I mean, it's --
I can tell you, there's -- a lot of people are working. What happens -- we're charging large tariffs to Chinese products that are coming in, which hurts China. As you know -- you saw the reports -- out of the 25 points, we're paying for four points out of the 25. They're paying for 21. That's a big difference.
I've always said that. We're taking in billions of dollars. And, frankly, we're creating a lot of industry. But the rate goes from 10 percent to 25 percent on March 1st. So they would like to do it, and I'd like to accommodate them. If we can, I'd like to accommodate China if we can get the deal done. It's a lot of work because this is a very comprehensive deal.
This isn't what we're talking about, you know, they're going to buy some corn and that's going to be it. No, they're going to buy corn. Hopefully, they're going to buy lots of corn, and lots of wheat, and lots of everything else that we have. But they're also talking heavy technology, heavy manufacturing, financial services, and everything else.
I think we can do it by March 1st. Can you get it down on paper by March 1st? I don't know. I can say, on March 1st, the tariff on China goes to 25 percent, and that's a big tariff.
Oh, I campaigned against Stacey Abrams. I know that President Obama campaigned for her. Michelle Obama campaigned for her. And Oprah campaigned for her. And all Brian had was me. And he won fairly easily -- you know, fairly easy. So I hope that she does a good job. I mean, I respect her. I don't know her.
I haven't met her. But I hope she does a good job.
I think it's unification. I think it's industry. I think it's about the people that you see right here. It's also working with these people, because they've been incredible. We have had some incredible report. And we've have incredible Republican support. The problem is, the Democrats -- you know, when they say, ""We don't want to build…"" -- as an example, ""We don't want to build a wall because it doesn't work or because it's immoral."" Well, it's also immoral the people that come into our country that shouldn't be here and kill people.
That's immoral, too. That's a lot more immoral. So -- but I really think it's doing to be a speech that's going to cover a lot of territory. But part of it is going to be unity. Yeah, please.
No, because if there's no wall, it doesn't work. She's just playing games. So if there's no wall, it doesn't work. And we're building the wall right now. I mean, a lot of people don't know that, but we have a lot of wall under construction. We've given out a lot of contracts over the last three, four weeks -- good contracts.
A lot of wall is soon going to be under construction. We will be -- we're finishing up design on certain areas, the most important areas -- the Rio Grande area and others. We are building a lot of wall. You know, I’m not waiting for this committee. And I've told a lot of people I don't expect much coming out of the committee because I keep hearing the words that, ""We'll give you what you want, but we're not going to give you wall."" The problem is, if they don't give us a wall, it doesn't work.
Without a wall, it doesn't work. We have caravans right now coming up from Honduras, who we give a lot of money to -- which is stopping, by the way. But we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And then they have caravans leaving their country, coming up here. And, by the way, if you go to Tijuana and you take down that wall, you will have so many people coming into our country that Nancy Pelosi will be begging for a wall.
She'll be begging for a wall. She will say, ""Mr. President, please, please give us a wall."" It'd be very interesting. Some people have suggested: Let me take the wall along California, let's move it to Arizona, let's move it to Texas. And, you know, it's going to -- it would be a very interesting statement.
About Nancy: So, in California, they wanted the wall built in San Diego so badly. And we built it. And probably I should have waited, because as soon as it was finished, they started screaming, ""We don't want a wall. We don't want a wall."" But they wanted the wall so badly. And, by the way, it worked. Nobody is getting through.
But the minute it was built, they started saying, ""We don't want a wall."" Without a wall, it doesn't work. It's very simple. I mean, I'm not saying this as a Republican. I'm not saying it as anything other than a fact-stater. Without a wall, it just doesn't work.
That, I can tell you, is horrible. I've seen it last night. I think that's horrible. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I'm concerned. As far as the people are concerned, many of those people wanted me to stay out, but I didn’t want to do it because people were getting hurt. People -- what I think is the worst sin of all is the fact that we're allowing people to come into this country and sell drugs and human traffic, and do all of these horrible things.
That if we had the simplicity of a well-constructed, beautiful barrier or wall, they wouldn’t be able to come into our country. That, to me, is the great sin. And everybody knows it works. I watched this morning, early in the morning, somebody trying to justify walls are immoral. I mean, if walls are immoral, maybe we should take down all the walls that are built right now.
You will see a mess like you've never seen before. So I only say this: I was elected partially on this issue -- not as much as people say, but partially on this issue. This is a very important issue. Nothing to do with elections. Nothing to do with votes. Nothing. Only to do with common sense and only to do with security.
And if we don’t put up a barrier or wall -- a strong one, but one that looks good -- in the old days, they used to build them; they looked terrible. Now we build them, they look really good. If we don’t put up a physical barrier, you can forget it. Our country is going to be a very unsafe place. People are coming in. Drugs are coming in. Human trafficking is coming in, which is so horrible.
Things are happening that won't happen after the wall is constructed. So we're building a lot of wall. We're building new sections that are starting in about two weeks. We're building some brand new sections -- large sections. And the wall is getting built. I would like to build it even faster, but it's getting built, and it's getting built very substantially, as some of you see because you've been there.
Yeah, please.
Yes. I do.
Yeah, we're going to very soon. We're going to announce it pretty soon. We'll be announcing it early next week.
And they very much want the meeting, and I think they really want to do something. We'll see. But I think they really want. But again, remember, North Korea was a whole different story. When I came to office, many people thought we were going to war with North Korea. I would sit and listen, and I would read people saying, ""Go to war with North Korea."" Well, you'd lose, I mean potentially, hundreds of millions of lives.
You know, Seoul has 30-some-odd million people, and it's literally right off their wall, by the way. But that wall works, I can tell you.
Well, it was one of my points. I had -- yeah.
Now they say it's the wall, because I've accomplished practically everything else. Look, I accomplished the military. I accomplished the tax cuts. I accomplished the regulation cuts. I accomplished so much. The economy is the number-one economy in the world. We're the number-one economy in the world. We're the number one, not even close.
Companies are pouring into our country. I've accomplished so much. So now they say, ""Oh, if he doesn’t get the wall…"" -- they make that the only issue. But it's not going to work, because I'm building the wall. The wall is happening right now, okay?
With respect to the committee?
I would say we're the same. Because I'm hearing they don’t want to do a wall, for political reasons. I actually think it's bad politics. I mean, frankly, I think them fighting us on what everybody knows has to be done to have proper security. And you can add the other things, but the other things only really work if you have the physical barrier.
Without the physical barrier, you just won't -- what are you going to have? Drones flying over the 12,000 people? You're going to have a nice drone flying -- doing circles around the 12,000 people that are walking in from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador? No, you don’t want that. So I want to do real things, like the deal with China.
I want it to be a real deal. I could do a deal with China, where people would say, ""Isn't that wonderful?"" It's not wonderful. I have to do the real deal. We have to open up China. We're open to them. They have to be open to us. So, it would be so easy for me to make a deal with China, but it wouldn’t be a real deal.
I could get them to buy more corn than they've ever bought, and more soybeans than they've ever bought. And they'd be so happy if I did that. But they're going to do that, but in even higher numbers. But we're going to do a lot of other things. And just remember, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from China.
We never took in 10 cents from China. China is being charged tremendous amounts of money for the privilege of coming in and doing what they do to our country. They're being charged a tremendous amount of money. And we're going to make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal with China, but it's going to be a very comprehensive deal.
We're going to cover everything, okay?
Well, the trade deals won't kick in for a while. You know, number one, the USMCA hasn’t even been approved yet. It has to go before Congress and get approved. Now, it should get approved quickly. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. During the campaign, I said I will either terminate NAFTA or negotiate a new deal.
And we negotiated a good deal. Now, if you went back to pre-NAFTA, that would be, frankly, okay with me. Pre-NAFTA or the new deal. But I won't allow NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal for this country. If you look at the scars all over our country, where you go to New England, you go to Ohio, you go to Pennsylvania, you see what -- I mean, what happened in North Carolina -- you have factories that are still empty from what happened with NAFTA. NAFTA was a horrible deal.
The USMCA is a great deal. But pre-NAFTA was -- we had huge surpluses with Mexico. With NAFTA, we have huge deficits. We lose $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico. Does that sound good? And this has been going on for many years. So I stopped it. I stopped it a lot.
No, there's nothing -- look, they had this from day one.
Could I have done it differently? No, not really. I mean, I think what -- by having the shutdown, we've set the table for where we are now. If I didn’t do the shutdown, people wouldn’t know -- they wouldn’t understand the subject. Now they understand the subject. They realize what a humanitarian crisis it is. It's sort of -- it's called, like in deal-making, ""setting the table,"" or, you know, setting the stage.
We've set the stage for what's going to happen on the 15th of February. I don’t think they're going to make a deal. I see what's happening. They're all saying, ""Oh, let's do this, but we're not giving one dime for the wall."" That's okay. But if they're not going to give money for the wall, it's not going to work.
And if it's not going to work, then the politicians are really wasting a lot of time. Okay.
I would do that. I would do that.
We have money. Just so you understand: We have money. We're building the wall right now -- a lot of it. People don’t know that, and nobody reports it, but that's okay. Because it's not very exciting when you say it's built. You know, people. But let me just tell you: We're building the wall right now. It's going up fairly rapidly.
We're renovating tremendous amounts of wall, which is good stuff that's in very bad shape with massive holes in it and fencing coming down. It's being beautifully renovated. In some cases, we have to replace it. We renovate some. We replace some. We build some new. But the wall is going up right now in all different forms.
Thank you very much, everybody.
We're going to see what happens on February 15th.
Against who?
No, I'm not concerned. I'm not concerned.
I'm waiting -- excuse me. I didn’t say that. I said I'm waiting until February 15th. On February 15th, the committee will come back, and if they don’t have a wall, I don’t even want to waste my time reading what they have because it's a waste of time. Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall.
Now, when you couple the wall with sensors and drones and all of these other things, that works, as a combination. But if you don’t have a wall, they're all just wasting their time. It's just politics. Thank you all very much.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Boy, what a crowd! What a crowd.
And you've got thousands and thousands of people standing outside trying to get in. It's amazing.
It's amazing. And you know, when I came over I was just watching the television, I watched one of the commentators say that we have a few thousand people here, a few thousand. You know a few thousand people? That means 3,000 people. He said, yeah, we have a few thousand people. And I said, oh, these people, forget it. This is not a few thousand. To me, a few thousand is 3,000. This is no 3,000, this is 13,000 or 15,000, but this is no 3,000.
And this is 20,000 if we get them in, so we'll try getting them in. But let's start, right.
Thank you, everybody, for being here. In 12 days we are going to win Ohio and we are going to win back the White House, believe me.
It's about time. A brand-new poll -- I love the good polls when they're accurate. Even if they're against me, which aren't so many against us, right, if they're accurate, but a brand-new poll just came out from Remington Research, highly respected, has us 4 points up in Ohio.
And we're leading in Florida and we're leading in Iowa and we're leading in a lot of places. They're starting to get very nervous, the press.
The dishonest media, world's most dishonest people. I'm trying to figure out, who is more dishonest? Crooked Hillary Clinton or the media.
I'm not sure, that's a close one.
Early voting, right? Everybody, did you vote? Did you vote yet.
Early voting is underway, so make sure to get out and vote, right? Who's voted? Who has voted.
Whoa! That's great. So get out and vote. And you know, November 8th is your last day, but if you do it before then, that's good, too.
And I love Ohio. I worked in Ohio.
You know, I worked here at the very beginning of my career I worked in Ohio in Cincinnati. And I'll tell you what, I love the people of Ohio.
And I was right next to Kentucky and I'd go across the line, I love the people of Kentucky, they've been so great, too, right? Yeah, come on.
Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track, which it certainly is. Who are the other 25 percent? Who are these people? Twenty-five percent think we're on the right track? We're going to fix it and we're going to get our country back on the right track very, very fast.
Real change begins with immediately -- immediately -- replacing and repealing Obamacare.
Disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was approved. It should have never been approved. It was approved by lies. You can keep your doctor: lie! You can keep your plan: lie! Twenty-eight times he said keep your doctor, keep your plan, all lies.
It has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare"" premiums
... oh, don't smile, because you know what? It's going to happen to you, too. It's going to happen. It is a total catastrophe, Obamacare"" in this country. And Hillary Clinton wants to keep it and make it even more expensive. And it's never going to work. Even Bill Clinton admitted that ""Obamacare"" is the craziest thing in the world where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. No good. Job-killing ""Obamacare"" is just one more way the system is rigged. Our system is rigged. Clinton wants to double-down on ""Obamacare
You're great.
Just this year, Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare"" is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama
And this is who you're going to have as president? I don't think so.
She's got bad judgment. Remember Bernie Sanders? He said she's got bad judgment; she does.
Here in Ohio, another five insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare."" They're out
Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.
Crooked Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after a congressional subpoena, lied to Congress under oath and then made 13 iPhones disappear, some with a hammer. Unbelievable.
Who here has gotten rid of their phones with a hammer, anybody in the room? Boy, this place is packed. That person. Why, home come? What business are you in, sir? Don't tell me, I don't want to know.
Now in another new report, we're learning that Hillary Clinton's State Department wasted hundreds of millions of dollars of your hard- earned tax pay spending on a wild bunch of things. Here are some of the kinds of shocking revelations about Hillary's spending habits. These are all State Department expenditures during her tenure: $5.4 million on a no-bid contract for crystal stemware; $167.5 million on cost overruns at the embassy in Afghanistan; over $200 million on mostly unused police training facilities in Iraq; $79,000 to buy copies of President Obama's books, wonderful, wonderful deal; $53 to polish marble at the Brazilian embassy, that's a great deal; $630,000 to try and make the State -- oh, this is a good one -- to try and make the State Department Facebook pages more popular.
Doesn't she understand you need personality to do that, not money. You need personality.
Not a lot of personality there, even though she'd get millions of dollars to make speeches. I tell you what, that wasn't a good deal.
Two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars to hire an event planner for a 4th of July party in Madrid; $88,000 to send three comedians to India. These are the things. More than $250,000 to purchase art in Mexico, where they're taking our companies and our jobs, now we're buying art.
We are going to build the wall 100 percent and Mexico is going to pay for the wall, don't worry about it.
And $410,000 to purchase art in China. The elites in government, like Hillary Clinton, believe they're entitled to do whatever they want. Hillary Clinton has never earned an honest dollar. Well, I think that's really, you know, hey, let's put it this way. What she's done to our country is a disgrace and she should be ashamed of herself.
She lives the high life at your expense, making money off the rigged system, and it is a rigged system. Are you starting to agree with me about the rigged system.
This is an election between the small handful of people who benefit from the corrupt system and the great majority of American citizens who are the victims of that same corruption. Those who benefit from the corruption will say and do anything to keep it the way it is, they don't want change.
Washington insiders, including the corrupt media...
... they are so dishonest, look down on hardworking people who make a very honest and, you know, really a fought-for living. And it's tough. It's tough when our country allows your companies to all leave and fire everybody. Pretty tough, isn't it?
The corrupt political class takes pride in ripping off the American people. Now these same elites, the people who brought us every disastrous foreign war, all of these horrible wars that they never win -- we go into wars, they never win the wars, they just go on forever. Disastrous. And then they've brought us these horrible trade deals, are spending millions to try to put Hillary in the White House so she can keep the deal going on and keep what we really love about our country, the greatness of our country, from the American people. It's not going to happen longer.
November 8th, everybody.
Hillary Clinton said she left the White House dead broke and now they're worth over $200 million. They didn't create anything, produce anything, invent anything. All they did was sell favors, sell access and sell out the American worker.
Uranium is right. Uranium to Russia, he just said uranium, uranium to Russia. Hillary even sold out our nation's security with her illegal private server, knowing full well it would put you and your family in danger. As moms across this nation put their children to bed each night with a prayer for safety and peace, Hillary was knowingly putting those same families at risk by putting our confidential secrets on this illegal, private server. But for Hillary, it seems anything is OK as long as it increases whatever it was she was looking for.
I'm running to put a stop to the theft of our great American prosperity.
We're going to do it. I'm running to put an end to corruption. I'm running to expose the crimes of our ruling class and give this country back to the middle class and to the people, to the people.
Hillary pushes trade deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that enrich her donors and strip the jobs out of your community. And then she says at the debate, remember, she never called it the gold standard, that's what she said. But at the next debate, which I don't want to brag, but I won the debates, OK? I'm not going to brag.
It wasn't hard. She was very tired at the end of those debates, did you notice? The scenes of her going to the car were not pretty.
She wants to raise your taxes, even if she used those taxes to spend lavishly on wasteful projects at the State Department. She pledges open borders, that means there goes your country.
There goes your country, open borders. In secret to her donors, even as it causes the loss of millions of American jobs and thousands of American lives, you see what's happening in terms of safety and security.
She talks about the values of tolerance, yet proposes to issue massive numbers of visas to places, and think of this, visas all over, to places where women and gays and minorities and horribly oppressed and brutalized. I mean, you see what's happening. Countries are pouring money into her and her husband and you see what some of these countries do to women and gays and to so many others. And she should give that money back to those countries.
But she takes money from these regimes without apology and doesn't worry about how extremism brought onto our shores will affect the quality of life for you or your family. Hillary has access to the best doctors in the world, but wants you and your children to live under Obamacare"" which is a catastrophe.
And she doesn't want to repeal it and she doesn't want to replace it, she wants it to get bigger and more expensive.
I'm running to end the rule of this corrupt ruling class.
And I was, I have to tell you, you know, I was on the other side of this equation, folks. I didn't need to do this. I did not need to do this. But I love this country, I love the people of this country, and we did it. And you know what? It's a movement like they've never seen before.
Never. And we're going to give government back to the people.
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to hear the words I'm about to say. When we win...
You know, I've been saying if we win"" because I want to be nice
... we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp.
So cute. I see this young boy here and he's screaming drain the swamp!"" He's this big
He's learning young, learning young about our government. Very cute.
You know, I didn't like the expression. I started it, what, a week ago, right? Drain the swamp. And I said I don't like it. And the people were going crazy, they loved it. All of a sudden I like it. It's like Frank Sinatra was a special guy, a difficult guy, but he had songs he didn't like, but they became his biggest songs, so he liked them. And drain the swamp
At the core of my contract, and that's a contract with America and the American people, is a plan and our plan to bring back our jobs.
We are living through the single-greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Look at what's happened to not only Ohio, everybody, everything, our country. Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by his lovely wife, Hillary.
We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. The steel industry has been hit so hard. U.S. Steel in Lorain laid off at least 600 workers in 2015, and that's after years of doing lots of layoffs. Republic Steel laid off over 200 workers this year. A Trump administration will immediately begin, and I have to do this, we will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA...
... and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better and stronger and fairer deal for our workers and our country.
We will also stand up to the Chinese currency manipulation, of which they're grand masters, and we will stop separately, because China right now is not in Trans-Pacific Partnership, but they want to be in it at a later date when they find out how good it is, they want to wait. We will become a rich nation again.
But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world with the vacuum. Look, she has created with Obama the way that we -- we should have never been in Iraq, but we should have never ever gotten out the way they got out. And the next time we attack whoever we're going to attack, maybe we could use a little bit of -- what's the best word? Surprise, right? Maybe we could use a little bit of, like, the element of surprise, would that be possible.
Instead of four months ago, three months ago, two months ago, we're going into Mosul in three months and we're going to -- in the meantime, hey, look, these people are tough and they're smart. We're going in to get the leaders because the leaders of ISIS they thought lived in Mosul and they probably did. But they were gone about, what, 12 seconds after they heard? They were gone.
So there we lose that. In addition, the fighters have really trenched in, make it much tougher. The element of surprise, the element of surprise, so sad. And it's a tough battle. These people are using human shields, they're fighting hard, they've been preparing. And I've been seeing four months ago, then three months ago, then two months ago, they say we're going into Mosul. Then a week ago I heard we'll be attacking sometime tomorrow. What the hell is wrong.
I always say, you know, I have great respect for General George Patton, although today he'd have a hard time being a general because he wasn't exactly politically correct. He was a little on the rough side.
But could you imagine? He's been known to slap a soldier who was not exactly the kind of soldier he liked. In other words, a soldier that wasn't so brave. He had been known to slap. Now, if that happened here? Oh, boy, can you imagine if that would happen today? But his people loved him and his people would fight for him. And he wants to take care of his people because he loved his people.
Thank you. He just said we'll fight for you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. But he wouldn't subject his people to announcing four and three and two and one month and then a week and then two days, we're going in tomorrow. This is crazy. This is crazy.
And he wouldn't subject because these were smart people, these were great military men that didn't have -- well, I mean, look, they had different presidents than what we have. What we have is somebody that honestly he doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
Doesn't know what he's doing. Don't forget, we shouldn't even be fighting for Mosul. You know, we had Mosul, but when we left they took it over, so now we have to go get it again. But we had Mosul. You know that. We left in such a dumb way, we just left, and then ISIS came and took it over. Remember, the junior varsity came and took over, right? So now we're getting it again.
But you're not going to get the people and you're not going to get the leaders because they're gone long ago. So we have to be smarter, we need people that know what's going on with life. And we don't have that right now.
Thank you. Thank you.
We need Donald Trump.
Now Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country...
... over and above the thousands and thousands that are coming in under President Obama, who, by the way, should stop campaigning for Hillary Clinton, get to the office, create jobs, help our military, help our vets who have been horribly treated.
I mean, this guy's campaigning. That's all he likes to do is campaign. Boy, oh, boy I've got more people campaigning against me. I've got Biden, he said I'd like to take him behind the gym. Oh, I dream of that. Biden.
You know what you do with Biden? You go like this and he'd fall over.
Tough guy, Mr. Tough Guy, Mr. Tough Guy. Just a little bit of a poof and he's gone. Another beauty.
Can you imagine if I ever made that statement? Donald Trump is a bully, he threatened Vice President Biden. Donald Trump is a bully, can you imagine? But he can say it, everyone thought, oh, that was a wonderful statement. Oh, oh, that was a -- give me a break. These people are the world's most -- they are so bad. Biden. I dream about Biden.
Boy, would that be easy. That would be an easy function.
A Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program.
And I want to build safe havens, but we have to use money from the Gulf states. They have plenty of money and they're not doing the job, but they've got a lot of money. But I want to see safe havens, we're all in the same thing, but we can't take people in this country who may do tremendous harm to us someday.
When you look at what's going on in Germany and Paris and all over France, you look at what's going on in Belgium, you look at what's going on throughout the world, and we're taking people in by the tens of thousands? Hillary wants to increase it by 550 percent.
That alone means, frankly, you shouldn't be voting for Hillary Clinton. Obamacare
Taxes, she wants to raise your taxes, I'm lowering your taxes. Believe me, this country can't take a tax hike. So let me state this and state it very clearly. If I'm elected president, I'm going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
We're going to keep them out. We're not going to be reading about -- they're not going to be reading about us in a hundred years and talking about the new version of the Trojan horse. OK? You know what that means, right? No going to happen.
A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
And, yes, we will build a wall and, yes, Mexico will pay for the wall.
Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. The victims include 60-year-old Margaret Kostelnik, murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant right here in Ohio. You know the situation, you know the story. You know the story of Margaret.
Earlier that day, her killer tried to rape a 14-year-old girl and shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park. Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime spree, but federal authorities acting under Obama guidelines refused to take him into custody, despite the fact that people were begging them to take this man off the streets. They wouldn't do it.
I have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers and the gang members preying on our citizens. When I win, your long reign of terror will come to a crashing and very unglorious end.
We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military, the greatest people on earth.
We will build new advanced aircraft at places like Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
And we will change our foreign policy. Hillary Clinton's policies in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya threw the Middle East into total mass turmoil. Now Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia, which could very well lead to World War III. I honestly think she's unstable. If you look at what she's saying, I actually believe she's unstable.
To all Americans I say it is time for new leadership.
We've spent now $6 trillion in the Middle East. We've spent, think of this, $6 trillion. We could have rebuilt our country twice. If our presidents went to the beach or, in Obama's case, if he went out and played golf every single day without making any decisions, we would have been far better off.
Let's compare my contract with the American voter against Hillary's agenda. Hillary will raise taxes as much as 45 and even 50 percent. That's just what you need. Just what you need is to pay even more taxes.
Highest-taxed nation in the world. My contract calls for the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.
Hillary will massively expand regulation and shut down American energy. My contract eliminates every job-killing regulation.
And we're going to put our miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work.
Hillary opposes school choice and wants federal bureaucrats to make education choices instead of the parents. My contract guarantees school choice and puts an end to Common Core. We bring our education local.
Hillary oversaw massive cuts to the military budget and said the problems at the V.A. are not widespread. Oh, they are really widespread.
The veterans have been treated so badly, so badly. She said they're not widespread. Right? Tell that to a veteran that waits in line for nine days and can't see a doctor. My contract reverses the defense cuts, rebuilds our military and gives veterans the right to see the doctor of their choice if they cannot see a veterans' doctor.
Hillary attacks the integrity of police officers. You see that all the time. My contract calls for funding, training and supporting the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
Hillary wants to release more violent offenders from prison, even as murder rates almost 8 percent in Ohio, did you know that, and have the largest one-year increase nationwide in 45 years. Did you know that? You don't hear that from the press. The biggest -- think of it, the biggest increase in murder in 45 years. You don't hear that. My contract calls for a national plan to reduce violent crime and treats safety as a civil right. It is a civil right.
Hillary Clinton wants to effectively abolish the Second Amendment and overturn the Supreme Court's ruling.
It's a big one. You saw her the other night at the debate. I don't even think she understood the question, talking about the Heller case.
Who won the debate, by the way?
I think that was an easy one. That was easy.
My contract calls for saving the Second Amendment and protecting the right to keep and bear arms.
We have to.
Hillary wants immediate amnesty, open borders and virtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world. My plan ends illegal immigration. By the way, people come into our country, we have strong borders, we will have the wall, we're going to stop the drugs, but we're going to have big, beautiful doors in that wall and people are coming into our country, a lot of people, but they're going to come in legally.
And we're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions. Hillary wants radical judges who will impose their personal opinions from the bench. My contract calls for the appointment of judges who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
Hillary wants to go even further than Obama on illegal executive action. I will terminate every single illegal Obama executive order and will restore the constitutional rule...
We will restore the constitutional rule of law in this country we have to have or we don't have a country.
Finally, Hillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C.
I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love of this great country.
I'm asking you to renew your faith in the American dream.
We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We are fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We are just -- this is such a divided country. This is such a divided country. We are living now in a very divided country. Our country is going to come together with love. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag.
Once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.
So we're going to work on a lot of things. We're going to work on coming together. We're going to work on our military. We're going to work on our inner cities. The inner cities need help, folks. They're so dangerous, they're crime-ridding, they're so dangerous, there are no jobs. There's essentially no education. We're going to work on our inner cities and make them great for African-American communities that are suffering in the inner cities. Suffering.
We're going to work on our jobs. We're not letting companies say everybody's fired, we're moving to Mexico or wherever they want to move. We're going to make our product, we're going to sell it back into the United States, no problem. No, well, there is going to be a problem. There's going to be a big problem. So I said they want to do that, I don't call it retribution, I call it consequence. The consequence is, you want to let all of these great people from Ohio and from North Carolina and from Pennsylvania and all of these other great places, you want to let them go and you want to leave and you want to go build this beautiful plant? You go ahead. But it's a 35 percent tax, as I said. And just 35 percent.
And, folks, and, folks, it's such a problem. We're losing our companies. We're losing our financial, we're losing everything. We're losing our jobs. We're losing our great jobs. You see it. Even the other side admits we're losing our good jobs. Our good jobs are going to other countries. So we're going to stop it. It's not even hard to stop it. And when they know there is that kind of a consequence, they're not leaving, they're staying. They may go to a different state, and that's different, right? But they're staying, they're staying in our country, they're not leaving. And when they want to leave, that's OK, too, because they're going to pay a very, very big price, right.
A friend of mine builds plants and factories, but he builds plants and he's the biggest in the world. And he told me what's happening in Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world, some of the biggest plants in the world, some of the most incredible plants that he's ever built. And I said, how are we doing in the United States? And he looks like, eh, not so great. We're going to change it, folks. We have to change it. I want Apple to be building factories in the United States, and plants, so they can make their product in the United States, not in China, not in Vietnam, not in all of the countries, and other companies, other of our great companies.
We don't make things anymore. We don't win anymore. We don't win anymore. We don't win with health care. We don't win with ISIS. We can't beat ISIS. We don't win anymore and we don't make things anymore.
It's going to change November 8th. You've got to get out November 8th.
And you're going to say that this was -- oh, that's a beautiful, big sign. Now, those are fans.
And by the way, I just spoke to our future vice president and he's OK. Do you know he was in a big accident with a plane? The plane skidded off the runway and was pretty close to grave, grave danger. But I just spoke to Mike Pence and he's fine.
He got out, everybody's fine. Everybody's fine. But what a great decision it was to get Mike Pence. What a great guy he is.
What a great job he's doing.
So you're going to remember this evening and you're going to remember, more importantly, your vote, whether it's on November 8th or sooner, and you're going to say it was the most important vote you've ever cast because we're going to start making things again and we're going to start winning again, that I can tell you.
And together as a big group and a loving group, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Thank you very much. God bless you. Go out and vote. God bless you, thank you.
"
Donald Trump,"That's right.
Well, I wanted to thank you too Emmanuel. We have, really, a very good relationship, very special. A lot of people wrote a couple of things that weren't quite correct, a little bit accurate, perhaps. We have little test every once in a while when it comes to trade.
The United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union, and we're working it out, and Emanuel has been very helpful in that regard, and something's going to happen. I think it'll be very positive.
We also have a very positive really a while ago on NAFTA, so this is turning out to be a good thing, but we had a very, very good meeting on NAFTA with Justin and his representatives. But I want to thank you. It was really helpful today.
I also want to congratulate you, because I'm reading what's going on in France. You've got great courage. You're doing the right thing. Nothing's easy, but what you're doing is the right thing, and it's a wonderful country. It's a special country, and you have a special president. That I can tell you Thank you very much.
Thank you.
We haven't brought that up.
"
Donald Trump,"So were you at Trump International Golf Links? Were you there? Did you go there?
Oh good. Did you see Sarah Malone?
Okay. You know, it's a tremendous place. Did you get a tour of the place at least? I hope?
Good, because that's important, that you see the quality. You know, a lot of people are saying that it's the single greatest golf course ever built. They're also saying that it's the best modern — I am sure you have some magazine articles and things.
So one of the very important things: We say modern, modern being from 1960. It's a great place. It's going to be great. But you know, the big play there, the big play will be building — someday, I'm not looking to do it now, especially, I'm not looking to do it — but you know we have a very big play to build, you know, thousands of houses, houses on the site. Because, it's, you know, it's a massive site, on the North Sea, and I'll be building — let me put it this way: Maybe I won't do it but maybe my children will do it. But we're zoned. It's a great place. It's the oil capital. I don't know if you noticed at the airport, more helicopters are there than at any airport in the world because they go out to the oil rigs, and it's the oil capital of Europe. And it's a great, you know, it's a great place, it's a whole great thing. But it's also a future very, very big development play, if I want to do that.
Yeah, this one — well, my mother was born in Scotland and, you know, golf is a very big game, it's a great game, all of the people you write about love golf — it's crazy. But I wanted to build something great in Europe, ideally in Scotland, and then it turned out I got Turnberry, which is where they had the British Open for years, you know, which is one of the great — I don't know if you got to visit that. And I also have Doonbeg, which is in Ireland, which I bought during the Ireland depression, you know when things were very low and now it has become — it's 500 acres on the Atlantic Ocean. So I actually have three —
Yes? What?
I really was. What happened, a couple of things: I did this and everyone said you'd never get it zoned. And it's zoned for two golf courses, if I want to do the second one, but two golf courses, and it's zoned for thousands of houses. You know, units and houses, the houses. But I'm not in a rush to build the houses because, to be honest with you, I have plenty of houses. Plenty of other sites. But this was a special site. This is consider the largest dunes anywhere in the world. It was very tough zoning because it was a site of scientific interest, it's called SSI. And everybody when I bought it — I bought it for the right price, I bought it for a very low price because you couldn't do anything with it. And the owner, who is a very good guy, felt you couldn't do — nobody thought you could do anything with it. In theory, you weren't even supposed to walk on the dunes, let alone build a golf course through the dunes, and what happened is I took a chance, I bought it and — no options, no nothing, just bought it for cash, no mortgage, no debt, no nothing — I don't have debt on any of them, I don't have debt on very much, period. But what happened is I bought it, and I applied for the course. I landed, I applied for the course, I hired Dr. Martin Hawtree, who is the preeminent — he does St. Andrews. I went to the Royal and Ancient — you know, that's the governing body in Europe — and I went to the Royal and Ancient, spoke to Peter Dawson, who is the head of Royal and Ancient, and I said: Who would be the best architect to use. And they said: Well, the greatest in the world for links golf — and he knew the site because he was born in Aberdeen — is Dr. Martin Hawtree. And I met him, we liked him, we came to a — you know, we walked the site a number of times. We built a course that turned out to be an incredible course. Now, in between seeing and building it, we went through a tremendous amount of legal and everything else because to break the site of scientific interest was a very hard thing to do, it has never been done before.
Right, well, what they did, what they did — you're right — what they did is, and I've wanted to do this as an artistic thing, and you saw what I mean about the land. There's no piece of land like this in the world, no matter where you go in the world. And the largest dunes in the world, it's in Scotland, it's on the North Sea — you know, every hole has a view of the North Sea, as you see. And, you know, when you look at the 18th hole and the 14th hole, I don't know if you remember the 14th? So anyways, so what happened is, I built it, and then they had this idea to build windmills, and I said: I don't want windmills. I don't want to have windmills. And they said: Well, we want to have them. And what happened is, you know, we've been in litigation for years, and now, in all fairness, the windmills no longer work. They don't work with 35 dollar oil. They didn't work at 100 dollar oil, you know, they're very expensive, and they're not going to work. And the company that was doing them is pretty much out of business, so they'll never get built. But I've been in court with them for years — not a big deal, but I've been in court with them for years.
So, I accomplished my goal, and my golf course is built. It's doing really well. It's, you know, people travel from all over the world to get there. And at some point I'll build thousands of units of housing, meaning my company will. You know, I'm not going to do it. After —
Okay, go ahead.
Well, I stopped it. I mean, the project is beautiful. It's like — the road, I built the roadway in, which was a very big thing. I built the course, which is sort of like the anchor tenant, if you think of it, you know. If you think of it, it's like the anchor tenant. I built it, and it's a world-championship course, it has been reviewed as one of the best in the world. So you have the roadway. You have everything done. I built the clubhouse, that's totally complete, you saw that, and now I have all of the sites ready for housing whenever I want to build them. But, you know, I'm not going to build them now because, well — and then I held it up because of the wind, you know, because of the windmills, because I didn't want them. I held it up because of the windmills because I didn't want to be staring at windmills, and now I won't be staring at windmills, and at some point, we'll go forward, and we'll do the rest of the job. But I'm in no rush, frankly, to do it. I did want to do, I did want to do this great golf course because there's no piece of land like it in the world and —
Well, I'll be doing that. Well, you have to understand. First of all, a couple of things happened. They came in, and they wanted to put the windmills up — you understand that — and I want a commitment that they're not going to build the windmills. And I've said that: I want a commitment that they're not going to build the windmills. Because I don't want to build and then find out that they're building the windmills. Now, they never told me that, and, you know, I've delayed them for many years, and they don't make economic sense any more anyway. They're not going to get built, but I wanted a commitment that they're not going to build the windmills. And that was the reason that I didn't finish it out. Then, of course, you had the oil reduction, you had the oil price go down, so that had an impact on the area, so I wouldn't want to be building units with the lower oil prices. And at some point it goes up, but, you know it's not — so I'm zoned for thousands of units. I can start whenever I want, and I'll start it when I want. But what I wanted to do there is I wanted to build the world's greatest golf course, which I built.
Now, did you get the reviews and everything? You probably saw Golf Week rated it at number one on the list. It's rated number one, number three in the world, number two in the world, number one. I mean, it's a phenomenal place.
That's only because it's under development now — in other words, I'm doing roads, I'm doing pipes, I'm all sorts of things. View the golf course like an anchor tenant, and the golf course does very well. It's doing great, actually. People are coming from all over the world to play it. But it's really under development, you know, the whole thing is under development. In fact, at some point we're going to build a ballroom. Hold it, Jenna, one second.
Hey Jenna, can I call you back? That's Reince. You know Reince, right?
So let me call you back. So it's been a tremendous, it's been a tremendous development. And, you know, at some time my kids will or the company maybe will build the houses or whatever. But that's it. Why don't I call you back later, or I'll call you tomorrow and finish it up. Is that okay?
Okay, honey. Thanks so much.
Okay, bye.
. What do you want to talk about, Aberdeen?
Well, I visited a lot but now since the presidential, I haven't. As you know, Turnberry — I'm thinking about, you know, it's under construction now but it's opening in June, and I was wondering if I should go over and cut the ribbon. Give me advice. I was wondering: Should I go over and cut the ribbon? You know, we've rebuilt the big building, it's a big hotel project and its got the great courses of the world, also, it's got a course that was a four-time Open Championship. You know, formally the British Open.
And the question is: Should I go there in June. What do you think? Would you go there if you were me and under my circumstance? Or no? You know this stuff better than I do.
Oh, no. No, no, that's false. Who told you that? That's absolutely false.
Where did you hear that?
Well, it doesn't matter what — absolutely not. The Royal and Ancient, we worked very closely together to rebuild Turnberry, the championship course and it's totally — yup, it will be there. It's totally, it's one of the rotas — you know, it's in the rotas, the system.
No, no, you're talking — By the way, don't write that because it's totally false.
In fact, we worked with the Royal and Ancient on, you know, we lengthened and modernized Turnberry and, you know, moved some holes out into the ocean, that was all done under the auspices of the Royal and Ancient — they're the ones that have the Open championship.
But I'm glad you brought that up.
There was one report, which was a totally false report about that — no, that was wrong. Okay?
By the way, when did I speak to you last? Tell me. When was it?
That was Wednesday. Okay. All right, good. So go ahead because, you know, one thing happened that I just wanted to know. We spoke when? Wednesday?
Okay, so go ahead. I what? I bullied my way?
Well, I will tell you what I have done, Jenna: I've built one of the great golf courses anywhere in the world, I think you see that, right? I don't know if you do or not, but I hope you do because that's part of the reason I'm talking to you. You saw the ratings that we've gotten, right? I think, have you?
People have given you and some people consider it the No. 1 modern, you know, new course in the world — new being defined, as I told you, from 1960. That's called 'new' in the world of golf.
But what I've done there is incredible. I built one of the great golf courses of the world, it's bringing tremendous tourism. Many other clubs are doing much better because of it. If you look at Royal Aberdeen and if you call the people at Royal Aberdeen. And if you call the people at Cruden Bay, which is another club that's fairly nearby. They say their business is way, way up because of what I built and it's been great. Now, because of the wind mills, I said I'm not going to — I told you this — but because of the windmills, I said I'm not going to proceed until such time as the windmills aren't going to be built. The windmills will never be built because the economics are even worse now than they were before, and they're old fashioned, and they're not working, and you know etc. And you know I've been in court for five years with them, and the wind mills will never get built because, you know, once the price of oil went down — by the way, the windmills didn't work at a hundred, at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel, the windmills didn't work. At 100 dollars a barrel they didn't work but now it's down to 30 dollars a barrel. And they really don't work. You understand: A lot of it has to do with the price of oil.
So the windmills won't get built and, you know, frankly, I can start that job — oh by the way, just so you know, I built the maintenance facilities, I built the roadway in and the roadway is like a highway — you drove down the road, didn't you?
Okay, so you se the road, it's like a highway. I built the road going down to the ocean. I built the clubhouse, I built the course. The rest of it is residential and we've already started the hotel because the hotel is part of the castle. I rebuilt, you know, I totally rebuilt the castle. Did you go in the castle?
McLeod House. And now what we're doing is we're going to be doing an expansion of McLeod House, in other words the concept has changed, much for the better. You know, as you own land, you get to know the land better and what works better. So the concept of what we're doing is now that we're expanding — in fact, we're in for approvals, but we're expanding McLeod House. We're doing nicely there and we're expanding it, as opposed to building something away from it. And I don't know if you saw — did you see plan for the expansion?
Okay. And the ballroom and everything? Right?
Okay.
And in addition to that, we'll build thousands of houses. So, and we'll continue to expand the hotel. You know, we're expanding — we can expand it very nicely. The project has been, it's an amazing project, and it's, you know, the big money in the project is to build the houses, I'll build the houses for the people that want to buy houses and apartments. But, you know, I just haven't until recently, I haven't wanted to do that because of the windmills. Now, the windmills won't get built. So at some point we'll do that. But, in the meantime, I'm running for president, Jenna. You know?
I mean, in all fairness, right now it's not exactly top of my mind because I'm running for president. But what I've done is made the land incredible. I mean, when you looked at the land originally, you know, it was a vast piece of land of 1,400 acres on the North Sea. Now it's a piece of land that's fully sculpted, it's beautiful, it's ready, and I can go any time I want. I just choose not to build now and one of the primary reasons is because I'm running for president.
But I've done, Jenna, a fantastic — I've built one of the great golf courses in the world. Now, the clubhouse is finished. You saw the clubhouse, I guess? Right?
Clubhouse is finished. The course is finished. The maintenance facility is finished. And McLeod House, which was a castle, built in the year 1401 was totally rebuilt and made magnificent and doing very well.
They're what? They're calling her what?
A bitch? No, I haven't heard that.
No, that I have not seen. No, I don't like that. I have not seen it, though, Jenna. How often do you go? Do you go to a lot of my speeches?
It's getting better and better?
I have not heard that. I don't like that. But I have not heard that. I would not be happy if I heard it. No, I have not heard it. Did you see that the crowds are getting bigger and bigger?
Why doesn't the press tell the, why doesn't the press — for instance, I have the biggest crowds. You saw Washington, you saw all of these places.
Why does the press not show the crowds?
Actually, you do. You've had a couple of the best photos — you're a good photographer, come to think of it. But I'm talking about generally speaking, like when I talk to people that watch the speech on television, they don't see the magnitude of what I'm doing. Because they don't show the crowds. You know what I mean?
No, I don't think so, I don't think so, I mean I feel that I'm very consistent but you must have flexibility. You can't just go — if you have a position, that doesn't mean that there is not a better alternative, and you can't have — I've dealt with people over the years that are totally inflexible and they're never successful. You know, a lot of times things are subject to flexibility and change, and it doesn't mean — and you know, I'm very upfront with people and I will tell people, but I think i've been extremely, I think I've been steadfast in my beliefs, actually. But with all of that being said, sometimes there is flexibility. Sometimes you want to negotiate. Sometimes, you know, etc etc. But, you know, and as you know the crowds are becoming more and more enthusiastic and bigger and bigger.
So, I don't know, it's been a — so you've been there for many of the rallies, right, Jenna?
How many?
Oh, wow. Wow. Well, I hope you don't get bored then, hearing me, because I try to change them up as much as you can. But when you think about it, you know, there are six or seven or eight main subjects, right? So, you know, it's — and certain things I like talking about a certain way, because it makes the point, and many of these people, most of these people haven't heard it before, you know. But you know what I mean, because you followed other politicians and many of them will make the exact same speech every single time. I don't do that.
When he lost?
Yeah, that's true.
He was very upset or I was?
Yeah, no, I was upset, because he should have won. I thought that he should have won that election — I mean, I know that he should have won that election. Had he asked me to go to Florida, you saw that I beat Rubio in a landslide, right? Had he asked me to go to Florida, like he should have, he would have won Florida. And you know, it was bad. They made a lot of errors, they made a lot of errors.
Oh, I was just like everybody else. I was watching it. I heard — I mean, it was too bad but I didn't run, it wasn't me that was running. Had they used me in a few of the states that he lost, he would have won those states. But they didn't do that. They used me in the primaries in five states — every single state that he used me, I won. I made speeches and I did robocalls. Every single state he won. In the general, they didn't use me — which was fine with me, I'm busy, you know, I'm always busy. But they didn't use my services and they should have and I would have won. I tell ya: I would have won Florida and that would have won him the election if he won Florida. But I would have done great there, I would have done great in Pennsylvania, you know, places he lost, we could have won. But they chose not to use my services — which was fine with me because I'm very busy, you know. But I was invited to the party and I felt that it was too bad. This was a great opportunity to win.
It's going to be interesting, right? You saw the polls come out where I am leading now in many cases, right? We've — it's come a long way from June 16, right?
I think, I think that consistency in the message is very important: Make America Great Again. Bring our jobs back. Make good trade deals. Build up our military.
Very important, Jenna, is the borders. Very, very important. You know the story, I just got endorsed by the border patrol, which they've never done before. 16,500 people, they've never done it before but they believe in me — So I think that's a message that has been very good for me and she'll be terrible on the message. Look at what she did with the miners in West Virginia, she said she's going to put them out of work. Not exactly the right message in West Virginia or anywhere else, frankly. So, treat me fairly, okay? Aberdeen is an incredible diamond, it's a jewel, it's like owning one of the great paintings of the world, but much better. And Turnberry will open in about two months and I think it's going to be a tremendous success and I did it in conjunction with the Royal and Ancient… But Turnberry is going to be incredible. it opens in two months. And it will be great. I have Eric Trump running it. Okay, you take care of yourself. Treat me fairly. Have a good time.
"
Donald Trump,"Thank you everybody. This is really an honor. We're going to win Ohio, right? Come here, Mike. We're going to win Ohio. We're going to win it all. Going to Make America Great Again. That's what we want to do. But the last time I got accused of speaking a little bit long, so this time we have to speak a lot short.
But I just want to introduce a man who's become a friend of mine. Somebody who is going to make an unbelievable vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.
Thank you very much Mike. I just also congratulate Don and Tiffany and Eric is going to have his shot tonight, and Eric's gonna be great, and Ivanka tomorrow night and my whole family. And Karen I want to just tell your whole family is an incredible family and we love having you with us in this endeavor and hopefully we're going to do an amazing job and an amazing job.

Tulip Siddiq,"The physical and mental health of many children with SEND has deteriorated in this pandemic, and we know that their families have felt abandoned.
The Government has failed to show the leadership needed to ensure SEND provision was not overlooked during this crisis. The sad result is that risk assessments have been few and far between and very few children with SEND have had their needs met.
There must now be a laser-like focus on ensuring that schools and local authorities can get every child back to school safely in September, with proper support for vulnerable children and those with SEND.
"
Louise Haigh,"The lack of detail and engagement from senior Ministers on the most significant change to border management in decades is staggering and irresponsible.
The Government’s careless approach risks a ‘perfect storm’ for Northern Ireland with businesses unprepared for major new requirements with their largest trading partner, at a time when they are fighting to stay afloat during the Covid-19 crisis.
The Prime Minister owes it to Northern Ireland businesses so badly let down by his broken promises, to urgently lay out the precise details of the new checks and arrangements that must be implemented in twenty six weeks’ time. This must include help with mitigation to avoid businesses going under as a result of the new costs, and outline if they will make use of measures like a bespoke Trusted Trader Scheme between GB and NI to avoid costly tariffs and checks on business.
