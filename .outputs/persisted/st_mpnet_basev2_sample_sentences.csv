Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-10-23,"Thank you very much, it's a great honor to be with you. And, Secretary Chao, you've been so fantastic in so many ways. Transportation -- it's just moving along. And you've done a fantastic job for me and for the country. And I appreciate all that you do.
And I shouldn’t say it because it always causes a problem, but we just don't have any problems there. It goes so smooth. And you're a very special person. Thank you very much, Elaine. Really appreciate it.
It's a true honor to host so many great leaders from Alaska, California, and Hawaii. In particular, I want to thank the President of the National Association of Counties and a member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, Greg Cox. Go ahead, stand up. Yeah, that's good. Thank you, Greg.
Also, Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler is joining us. Where is Andrew? Andrew is here someplace. I saw him back there. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much.
Since I first took office, my administration has made it a priority to invite county commissioners from across the United States to the White House. Very, very important people to me and to a lot of other people. Perhaps to some people, you're not important. But, to us, you'll always be important, okay. We know where it's at.
I am pleased to say that more than 3,700 local officials from all 50 states have now participated in a White House State Leadership Conference.
In recent weeks, we have seen the crucial importance of state, local, and federal partnerships. Natural disasters have struck states across the nation, including each of yours -- and very heavily in your states. In every instance, our joint response and recovery efforts have been critical to saving lives and rebuilding communities.
The White House State Leadership Conference is a perfect venue for us to share priorities and to forge partnerships.
This is a truly exciting time for America. You've heard me say this before, but we just got the World Economic Forum the recognition that the United States has reclaimed its rightful place, after many years of being off the list, as the most competitive economy anywhere in the world. Nice. It's a big statement.
And if you look at consumer confidence, we're at the top of every list. We're setting records in terms of that, too. But we got back on the list in the number-one position and world's most competitive.
Following the passage of our massive tax cuts and regulation cuts, the unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years -- 5-0. Great.
We have created more than 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
Median household income in 2017 was the highest level ever recorded.
Hispanic American household income reached an all-time high, historic level. Hispanic American poverty and African American poverty have reached an all-time low. The lowest levels ever.
Hispanic American, African American, and Asian American unemployment all recently achieved their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country.
We've reached a deal to replace NAFTA. And, as you know, I wasn't a big fan of NAFTA. I think it's one of the worst trade deals ever entered into. I rate it second; I won't tell you what the first is. And I won't tell you it's the WTO. Okay? I refuse to tell you the name. I refuse to say what it is, though. Keep it quiet. Am I allowed to say ""off the record""? Let's see.
And we have a tremendous new deal with -- so, with the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The ""USMCA,"" we call it. I didn't want the ""NAFTA"" name on it, because I saw what NAFTA did many years ago to towns and factories and businesses; and what it did to the car companies where -- not so much to companies -- to Michigan, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania and Kentucky and so many other places where these companies just left the United States. And we still have empty factories all over the place from that devastation of NAFTA.
Well, we have just the opposite: the USMCA. One of the strongest things about that, you're not going to have companies leaving anymore, because they have a dis-incentive to leave. I don't want them to leave.
Call me a ""nationalist"" if you'd like, but I don't want companies leaving. I don't want them firing all their people, going to another country, making a product, sending it into our country -- tax-free, no charge, no tariff, no nothing. And in the meantime, we end up with empty plants, unemployment all over the place. We end up with nothing. So those deals are not happening anymore.
We also completed a wonderful new deal with South Korea. This was a deal that the previous administration did. And they promised 250,000 jobs. They said, ""This will create 250,000 new jobs."" And they were right -- for South Korea, not for us. So we've renegotiated the deal with South Korea. Now, it's a reasonable deal.
Just last week, I signed a presidential memorandum to dramatically improve the reliable supply and delivery of water critical to states like California. I saw it on the campaign trail, and I saw it numerous times. But I was out in that area -- actually with Congressman Devin Nunes, who is a terrific guy, and some of the congressmen that, right now, are out there so happy at what I signed.
And I look at these incredible, beautiful fields, and they're dry. It's like dry as a bone. And I see hundreds and hundreds of acres as far as the eye could see, and then you'd have a little, tiny, little green patch in the corner. Just beautiful -- green. It's so beautiful. So rich.
And I said, ""Huh, what's going on? You have this little patch, and then you have all this dry, horrible…"" -- really, to me, it was horrible. It was all dry land. And they said -- I said, ""You must have a tremendous drought going on."" This is like, three and a half, four years ago. I said, ""You must have a tremendous drought going on.""
They said, ""No, we have so much water, we don't know what to do with it. But they don't let the water come down to us. It naturally flows to us. They won't let it -- they send it out into the Pacific Ocean. Millions and millions and millions of gallons. We have the greatest farmland anywhere in the world, but they won't give us water. So the only areas are if we take little spots on these massive areas of land.""
I could see it. I'm driving down the highway and I'm saying -- after, like, 10 minutes of looking at all this barren -- and then a little spot of beautiful. So green. I've never forgotten it.
And I said, ""What's going on here?"" But I assumed it was a drought. They said, ""No. The government, state and federal, send the water out into the Pacific."" I believe he said they're trying to protect a smelt. Little, tiny -- which, by the way, is doing very poorly. Nobody knows what a smelt is. I still don't know what a smelt is. But it's doing very poorly. It really is a terrible thing.
I said, ""So, let me ask you…"" And they have a -- they have a -- like a valve, but massive. Like from a faucet, but massive. And they turn it and the water goes pouring, Elaine, out into the Pacific Ocean, where it means nothing. Like, like a drop. For the Pacific, it's a drop. For the farmers, it's like we have more water, more economic development than anything you can do in the state of California.
So it left a great impression. And I told them, I said, ""Listen, if I win the nomination…"" -- this was during -- before I got the nomination -- ""…and if I go on to victory, I'm going to come back and revisit this. This is a seriously defective thing going on."" I thought they had a drought. I said -- you know, I didn't realize. They said, ""No, we have so much water, we don't know what to do with it.""
Then you have all the forest fires burning. We have so much water, they could actually water some of it. And of course, Secretary Zinke -- I'm sure he talked about management. Because, you know, we're tired of giving California hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars all the time for their forest fires, when you wouldn't have them if they managed their forests properly. They don't. They have lousy management.
And the environmentalists are, you know, doing something very bad. They won't let us take the logs. They won't let us take the dead trees. It's all a mess.
And if you did it properly -- I was in another state I won't mention, but I was in another state where they have tremendous forests and it's a very well-managed state. And they maintain their property. And when a tree dies, it doesn't sit there dry as a bone; rotting; and, if a little spark hits it, the whole -- they lose 200,000 acres.
And they've tested and they did -- and, basically, it's almost -- you can't lose anything when you maintain. They sometimes have a grass burn-off underneath the tree; doesn't affect the tree. Doesn't last long enough to light the tree. And they said, ""We had two areas we checked. One was where we let it be, like the California where they have such a disaster. And the other was where we cleaned and managed the forests.
We lit one; we lost a half an acre. We lit the other; we lost like -- I don't know what he said -- like 100,000 -- it was out of control. And these guys are really good with this. But they did it as an experiment. They lost a tremendous -- thousands and thousands of acres. We couldn't put it out, they said.
So, California, get on the ball. Because we're not going to hand you any more money. It's ridiculous, okay.
So with the water, we're looking at that. I mean, we're not only looking, it's going to be approved. We're -- Andrew Wheeler, EPA, is working on it; and Zinke; and everybody. We're going to have that approved fast. And the state has to approve it too. And I hope the state will do it. You know, in California, it might be tough, but they have to do it. They have to do it.
Do you know the kind of money you're talking about for the state and for the federal government? You're talking about an area that's not doing well, to an area that would be the most robust farmland in -- anywhere in the world.
Because I've heard -- I don't know, you people are nodding like you know exactly what I'm talking about. I hear it's the finest land there is for growing things. But they took away the water. You know, it's artificial. They took it away. Do you understand? Am I correct? Do you want to stand up? You look like you know exactly what you're talking about. I don't know who he is, but that's okay. Nice-looking man. Go ahead.
Oh, you're Central Valley?
That's great.
Absolutely.
It's true.
And you used to have the water, right?
They turned it off. They literally turned the water off.
I did.
Well, we have to get the state bill to get it approved. To be honest with you, we stuck on this point. But it has such -- especially with the commissioners and every -- we have to get the state to approve their share. The amount of jobs you're talking about is an enormous. The amount of economic development -- the hundreds of millions of dollars. And it'll be better maintained, much better maintained.
Yes, please.
So horrible, isn't it?
Well, I know California well. And I see houses, beautiful houses -- people are very proud of their house. Their lawn is brown. It's dying. It's dead. And they end up taking it out and just have sand in front of their houses. And they have so much water, they don't know what to do with it. It's so crazy.
And you're lucky, you have the climate and you have the -- and you have the heat. But you have the water. Very few climates have that. Most climates like that don't' have water; you do. You have so much you don't know what to do with it. It is a disgrace.
So on behalf of all of the congressmen that I signed with the other day -- and I hear, in California, it was very well received. The people want it. And it's not; it's the opposite. That's one of the great examples.
Okay, you tell the people we're with them and, whatever we have to do to push the state, we will do to push the state. And those congressmen that stood behind me -- those people are great people. They're not doing it for themselves. They're great people. They just know what's right and wrong.
So good luck. We will be pushing. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for being here.
Later today, I'm going to sign America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which authorizes important investments in ports and harbors and waterways and levees and water systems in communities all across our country.
I was in Texas last night, where we had a seriously amazing crowd of people. So they want to hear something. You know, they're waiting. They're tired of what's been happening for so many years.
And big oil -- they can't get ships into harbors because they can't get permits to drain. And is Andrew Wheeler here someplace? Because I'm going to ask Andrew to get that done right away. If you -- if Andrew could just step up, I'll ask Andrew to get that done. And their ports -- where is he?
Oh, come here, Andrew.
He's Acting, but he's going -- he's doing well, right? So maybe he won't be so Acting so long -- Andrew -- especially if he gets this done.
So, in Texas, they can't get the big ships in because they need to dredge a couple of feet. Standard stuff. They can't get the permits. It's not for months; they've been trying for years. But the ships have gotten much bigger and probably with the silt, it's gone up a little bit.
But if you could work with the state of Texas, and I'll give you the names, they were just -- last night. They say the cost of this is enormous what it's costing not to do it. The dredging is very -- but they need dredging. You may have heard about it. You may know it.
But whatever you can do for the great state of Texas. This way they can bring the giant ships right in, fill them up, and they go out.
And it'll be a tremendous difference. It will sell a lot more oil. We have now become the number-one energy source in the world. Can you believe it? In the last little while. If you could do that, Andrew, okay.
Thank you. He'll get it done. To expand -- boy, we're getting a lot done. I was just going to say a few words. Where's Kellyanne? Our great Kellyanne. She's so good. She's -- they're all backstage here. I think they're all looking for something exciting. Oh, she's speaking? Isn't she after me?
Oh. That's going to be interesting. She's speaking. Maybe I'll have to hang around and hear her speak.
To expand opportunity for all citizens, we are also focused on vocational education. To me, very important. And I'm proud to have signed into law the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. That's a long name, but good name. And I love the name ""vocational.""
You know, when I was growing up, we had vocational schools. Today you have community college. I'm trying to say, ""Well, a community college -- what do they teach? English and Latin and -- what are they teaching?"" The old days, we had vocational schools.
And I'd go to school with people who knew -- weren't necessarily good students, but they could go outside after school hours and take away a car engine, take apart electric motors, take apart their -- and nobody else -- the best student in the class didn't even know what they're doing. They had no clue. But they were great at that, and that's what they liked to do.
And we've gotten rid of vocational schools and we've replaced them with community colleges. We need vocational schools. It's great money.
I mean, did you see a recent study came out? They earn more than a lot of the white-collar people that go out and they work behind a desk. They're doing better. And that's their ability, and that's what they want to do. So we have to bring back vocational schools. Use that name. I think it's a much better name.
Our Pledge to America's Workers has also resulted -- and Ivanka Trump worked so hard on this -- in employers committing to train more than 4 million Americans. And that number is now up substantially. These are the company's training.
One of the most important areas of state and federal cooperation is public safety. In the past, and if you look at post-9/11 era, we know how capital -- and how critical it is to have a seamless cooperation between all levels of law enforcement. And I want to specially thank the community leaders here today we have expressed their support for working with federal immigration authorities. So important. So great.
And a lot of times you're not allowed to do it, by some bad leadership in various states. You have some bad leadership, but you know what the right thing to do is. So I want to thank all of those people that work with federal immigration authorities to remove gang members, drug dealers, and criminals from your community. Sounds like a pretty easy thing to do, I think.
So what do they do? They say, ""No, we don't want gang members removed from the community""? ""We don't want -- we don't want criminals removed."" I guess, right? Someday, you'll have to explain the politics of that, okay? Because I don't' get it. I don't' think too many people in this room do either because you know what you're doing at the highest level. But I appreciate you working with the authorities.
My administration is also working closely with state and local leaders to save the lives of those suffering from the scourge of drug addiction, by taking historic action to confront the opioid epidemic, and also the drug epidemic. I mean, just the drug -- generally -- epidemic.
Since last year, the totally number of opioid prescriptions has decreased by 17 percent. And we're very -- working very hard on the drug problem.
You see what's going on on the border. You see how bad the immigration laws are given to us -- thank you very much -- by the Democrats. They're the dumbest laws anywhere in the world. Dumbest immigration laws anywhere in the world. There's nothing -- catch-and-release.
You know what catch-and-release is. Release him. You know where we release him? Into the United States. Supposed to come back for a trial two or three years later because the judges -- you know, you need thousands of judges. How do you have judges for that many people? It's so ridiculous.
Another country doesn't do that. They say, ""I'm sorry, I can't come in. You can't come in."" Once they set a foot on our land, it's like, ""Welcome to the United States."" It is the dumbest. We're changing it. But we need Republicans. We need people -- or Democrats that have common sense, or Democrats that aren't going to listen to their bosses, because that's what it is.
But you see what's happening. And you see the drugs they pour into our country through many different ways, but many through the southern border. And we're taking care of it.
You also see what's coming up. We have a lot of people coming up. We can't let that happen. We either have a border or we don't. We need a wall. We've put up some of the wall. We do it as fast it comes.
The money comes in; we are building. I said, ""Maybe we'll leave it until the end."" Because they wanted it so badly. They're strong politically. But I said, ""Look, let's get it done."" And we've done a great job with building it, and it's had a tremendous impact on San Diego. And I'm not sure; I think the people will tell you that. But I'm not sure that the governor would tell you that or any of that.
We're in a system that's so political that they don’t want to do what's right if it's politically good for them. And the fact is, I actually think it's bad politically for them; they just don't realize it. And maybe that's why we're here and they're there. Maybe that's why. Maybe that's why. Could be.
But last year, ICE -- they're very brave, brave people -- and Customs and Border Patrol seized more than 2.8 million pounds of illicit and deadly narcotics. Early estimates show that, in 2017 and 2018, fentanyl -- a real horrible situation with fentanyl -- seizures were more than four times higher than the previous two years. We're working very hard on that. Even going through the postal systems, we're working very hard. You saw the change we made last week.
On these initiatives and so many others, we're working hand in hand with your state and local leaders: you. And we're getting tremendous cooperation. I appreciate it very much because otherwise we can't beat -- you can't beat this problem. The state people are so important to what we're doing. We're committed to a future of safety, opportunity, and prosperity for all Americans, from California, to Hawaii, to Alaska, to every state in our magnificent Union.
Thank you all for being here. Thank you all for your incredible service. We really appreciate it. We're going to work with you so hard and so strong. And any problems, you call -- just call me direct. Why not? I'm here. Okay. But we will work with you 100 percent.
Thank you all very much. You do a fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Addresses the White House State Leadership Day Conference,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-state-leadership-conference-october-23-2018
Barack Obama,United States of America,2009-06-04,"Chancellor Merkel and I have just finished our tour here at Buchenwald. I want to thank Dr. Volkhard Knigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were witnessing. I am particularly grateful to be accompanied by my friend Elie Wiesel, as well as Mr. Bertrand Herz, both of whom are survivors of this place.
We saw the area known as Little Camp where Elie and Bertrand were sent as boys. In fact, at the place that commemorates this camp, there is a photograph in which we can see a 16-year-old Elie in one of the bunks along with the others. We saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, the barbed wire fences, the foundations of barracks that once held people in the most unimaginable conditions.
We saw the memorial to all the survivors -- a steel plate, as Chancellor Merkel said, that is heated to 37 degrees Celsius, the temperature of the human body; a reminder -- where people were deemed inhuman because of their differences -- of the mark that we all share.
Now these sights have not lost their horror with the passage of time. As we were walking up, Elie said, ""if these trees could talk."" And there's a certain irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror that took place here.
More than half a century later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not diminished. I will not forget what I've seen here today.
I've known about this place since I was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who was a very young man serving in World War II. He was part of the 89th Infantry Division, the first Americans to reach a concentration camp. They liberated Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald's sub-camps.
And I told this story, he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and isolating himself for months on end from family and friends, alone with the painful memories that would not leave his head. And as we see -- as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that someone who witnessed what had taken place here would be in a state of shock.
My great uncle's commander, General Eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence. He had seen the piles of bodies and starving survivors and deplorable conditions that the American soldiers found when they arrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be too stunned to speak about them or be able -- be unable to find the words to describe them; that they might be rendered mute in the way my great uncle had. And he knew that what had happened here was so unthinkable that after the bodies had been taken away, that perhaps no one would believe it.
And that's why he ordered American troops and Germans from the nearby town to tour the camp. He invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness and ordered photographs and films to be made. And he insisted on viewing every corner of these camps so that -- and I quote -- he could ""be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.""
We are here today because we know this work is not yet finished. To this day, there are those who insist that the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful. This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history.
Also to this day, there are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance -- racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victims and diminishes us all. In this century, we've seen genocide. We've seen mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground; children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. This places teaches us that we must be ever vigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must reject the false comfort that others' suffering is not our problem and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others to serve their own interests.
But as we reflect today on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, we're also reminded of the human capacity for good. For amidst the countless acts of cruelty that took place here, we know that there were many acts of courage and kindness, as well. The Jews who insisted on fasting on Yom Kippur. The camp cook who hid potatoes in the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellow inmates, risking his own life to help save theirs. The prisoners who organized a special effort to protect the children here, sheltering them from work and giving them extra food. They set up secret classrooms, some of the inmates, and taught history and math and urged the children to think about their future professions. And we were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony that the base for the resistance was in the latrine areas because the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there. And so out of the filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could thrive.
They could not have known how the nation of Israel would rise out of the destruction of the Holocaust and the strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own. And they could not have known that one day an American President would visit this place and speak of them and that he would do so standing side by side with the German Chancellor in a Germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued American ally.
They could not have known these things. But still surrounded by death they willed themselves to hold fast to life. In their hearts they still had faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is unknowable it arches towards progress, and that the world would one day remember them. And it is now up to us, the living, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take, and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain. It is up to us to redeem that faith. It is up to us to bear witness; to ensure that the world continues to note what happened here; to remember all those who survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed just like us.
And just as we identify with the victims, it's also important for us I think to remember that the perpetrators of such evil were human, as well, and that we have to guard against cruelty in ourselves. And I want to express particular thanks to Chancellor Merkel and the German people, because it's not easy to look into the past in this way and acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that they will stand guard against acts like this happening again.
Rather than have me end with my remarks I thought it was appropriate to have Elie Wiesel provide some reflection and some thought as he returns here so many years later to the place where his father died.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-08-28,"So, thank you very much everybody. Alice Johnson has been just incredible. She's gotten out; she's recommended people to us. She knows many, many people that have put -- been put in prison, and -- whether they should have been or not. She knows that they were put in for too long.
Alice was given a life sentence.
And you spent about 22 years?
And -- for something that, today, a lot of people wouldn't even be going to jail for. And it was -- it was horrible. And we found out about it. And we gave a commutation; that means we were able to get Alice out. And she has been just so outstanding, and I'm so proud of you.
And we're giving Alice a full pardon. I just told her. We didn't even discuss it. We just -- you were out there; I saw you in the audience last night. And I asked the folks if you could bring Alice over, and we're going to give a full pardon. We're going to do it right now.
That means you have been fully pardoned. That's the ultimate thing that can happen. That means you can do you whatever you want in life. And just keep doing the great job you're doing.
Alice had done an incredible job since she's been out, and -- recommending other people. We said, ""How many people are they like you?"" There's only one Alice, as far as I'm concerned. But how many people are like you or your circumstance, where they were given this massive sentence? And they're good people, great people. And she said, ""So many. They're in jail. So many.""
And she's looking for those people, and she's recommending those people, and we've already done some that you know -- that you know are good people. And they've done really well since they've been out.
So we're taking Alice from a commutation to a full pardon, and I'm going to sign it right now. And we're very proud of Alice and the job you've done --
-- what you represent.
And Pastor Robert Jeffress -- unrelated, but he was here. And we thought maybe I'll sign this, and then maybe you'll like to say a prayer.
And maybe you could include the media because they need it probably more than we do. They definitely need it more than Alice. Okay, thank you.
So, Alice, it's a full pardon. It's been signed. You might want to keep that one. And here it is.
Pastor, please.
Thank you very much, Robert. That was really --
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Alice, thank you very much, and congratulations. It's a real honor.
It's a real honor.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Issues a Pardon for Alice Johnson at The White House,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-pardon-alice-johnson-august-28-2020
David Miliband,United Kingdom,2015-12-17,"I want to start with a simple point. I am here as a politician. And we are at an absolutely critical time in the life of the Government – the first Labour government re-elected to serve a full term, the only Government in Europe to be raising investment in education and health care as a share of national income, the first Government since 1945 to make the renewal of public services its number one priority.
Day to day and week to week it is your decisions that help patients, pupils, victims of crime. But politics sets the direction, the investment, the purposes, the priorities. I want to use my short time to address the following: what is a distinctively social democratic approach to public services, and how we make a social democratic settlement for public services a reality in Britain.
A Social Democratic Settlement
I speak as someone who believes passionately in the renewal of social democracy – the project of civil, social and political progress that dominated reform, though not always government, of industrialised countries for most of the 20th century. The aim for our country is simple: to extend to all the life-chances of the most fortunate. And the challenge for public services follows directly: to create a public realm where security and opportunity are available on the basis of need not ability to pay.
This needs more than good policies – though they are vital, and numerous in the work being done around the country. A social democratic settlement for public services aims to embed in the governing structure and culture of the country new parameters for public policy.
We need services that are, and are seen to be, excellent or improving or both. But we need more. A social democratic settlement for public services would have distinctive features:
– a social democratic settlement would tilt against inequality, giving greatest help to those in greatest need, and using the power of an active welfare state to change life chances;
– a social democratic settlement would engage citizens in their production of public services; people do not want to spend their lives in meetings, but they will increasingly want choice and voice in how their services are delivered
– it would embody the best of social partnership, making the most of the sense of vocation among public servants, and using this commitment as a spur to the most modern working practices, not an excuse for holding back change
– it would have funding secure, sustainable and equitably raised;
– and it would recognise that the public sphere cannot do it all, and instead thrives when it brings together the best innovation from public, private and voluntary sectors.
If these are the aims, I see three central challenges to their achievement, derived directly from the ambitions I have set out. They go to the heart of the political and policy choices open to us today. They concern the role of the individual citizen, the purposes set by government, and the incentives for staff.
Some people argue that by definition mass services cannot deliver the personal touch. I disagree. Services for all citizens can be customised to the needs of each citizen.
In education we call it personalised learning. Its key components try to learn from experience – strengths and weaknesses – of professional power and market forces. It depends on flexibility at the front line, choice for the learner, and incentives for innovation:
– the education service can only be personalised when there is serious and ongoing assessment of individual student need; this requires the time of staff and the engagement of students
– it needs school staff to be able to deploy a range of teaching strategies, so professional flexibility and development are key
– the school and its component lessons need to be organised around the learning needs of the student, so that lesson times and timetables are informed by what we know about how youngsters learn as well as what they want
– when students get older they need an increasing range of curriculum choice, within the school and including college and work-based alternatives; this requires integration of service between different institutions
– and services in school must be properly linked to services beyond, which is the exciting promise of the new engagement between education and children’s social services.
These foundations of personalised service cannot be restricted to the education service. From what I understand intelligence-led policing is founded on serious engagement with data; efficient hospital care depends on proper integration of primary and secondary services around the needs of the patient; this summit can deliver deeper understanding of the links and similarities.
The second challenge concerns the relationship between excellence and equity. We see this in every debate, from Foundation Hospitals to university funding to specialist schooling. In an unequal society, how can excellent provision serve the least fortunate, rather than the most?
There are two answers. One is to say we cannot; excellence will always be monopolised by the well-off, so a social democratic approach should be simply to tackle poor performance.
I believe this is profoundly wrong. We must obviously tackle failure. But aside from the absurdity of trying to put a glass ceiling on the achievement of different services, excellence can be used as a battering ram against inequality.
Education is a case in point. Since 1997 the number of schools judged effectively failing by Ofsted has fallen by 960 in primary and 227 in secondary, to 207 and 78 respectively. But tackling inequality of opportunity requires us to do more:
– by challenging every school to develop a centre of excellence for itself and as a resource for other schools; this is the aim of the specialist school programme
– by paying the best schools in public and private sectors to partner with other state schools and spread their good practice; this is the aim of the Leading Edge programme, which now involves 100 leading schools and 600 learning from them
– by pooling budgets so schools can use each other’s resources to raise standards; this is how leadership development is being fostered in our 1400 toughest secondary schools
– by promoting the development of federations of schools, and syndicates of schools, that replicate excellent provision.
So excellence should be a resource for a more egalitarian system, not a threat. It can do more than set an example; it can be a locomotive for improvement across the system.
The third challenge is about how we combine flexibility in delivery with accountability for results. No one believes every community has the same needs; but flexibility on its own can lead to poverty of aspiration and paucity of provision.
It may be tempting to say that that strategies, targets, Czars and interventions are a diversion. But they are a reaction to the laissez-faire that led to low aspirations, provider convenience, limited innovation. We saw it in English secondary education in the 1970s.
We need central and local government to speak up for the fragmented voice of the consumer, and make good the market failure that allows underperformance to continue. I stress the importance of local government: a Britain of a 100 strong, vibrant and challenging city governments would be a great place.
But here are what I see as the bones of the settlement between front line providers and their funders in central and local government:
– There must be public information on performance, produced in an accessible form, that commands the confidence of professionals and citizens. It should rounded and informed view of how different institutions are performing. That is why we are developing the idea of a School Profile, that will set out in an accessible way qualitative as well as quantitative information beyond the bare bones of raw and value added exam and test results. The answer to the limitations of league tables is more information not less.
– There must be central intervention to set minimum standards. For example in the 111 schools with less than 20% of pupils getting 5 GCSEs grade A-C, and the 425 schools above 30% but underperforming given their intakes, we are intervening directly from the centre to help them make progress.
– This central intervention must be in inverse proportion to success, and critically it should be an organised and systematic engagement with a single accountability mechanism. In education it is what we are now calling the ‘single conversation’: every school with an annual engagement with all its partners, central and local, to identify problems, agree priorities, set targets.
– Choice between services helps raise the quality of those services; it promotes innovation and improvement; but it is most effective when it is combined with voice for individuals over their services, to help shape it to their need.
– Some funds will always need to support central initiative – to tackle inequalities, to promote innovation, to spread good practice; but the aim should always be to end up mainstreaming it in front line services. So funding should be delegated as soon as capacity exists to the frontline, with full flexibility to meet local need.
Intelligent accountability is the essential foundation of public confidence in public services. It can be a burden, but it is a vital one, because it supports improvement and challenges the lack of it.
A social democratic settlement for public services is vital for the future of the country – and most vital for those in greatest need. Enabling government, empowered staff, informed citizens. This is the relationship I have tried to sketch out today. I look forward to discussing it with you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-08-13,"The stock market continues to do very well. We have very, very strong numbers. We have a lot of artificial numbers from other countries because they're all devaluing their currencies. They're really doing things that aren't very good for their countries, in my opinion. But, short term, it's very good for their countries.
Long term, possibly not. And we're not following suit. We have a Fed that decides not to cut interest rates, which is a very bad thing. Because, right now, we have to follow suit; we should be following suit. But we have a very powerful country, a very strong economic and military country. We've never been better.
The stock market is way up today for various reasons, including tariffs. I just see where we've collected close to $59 billion in tariffs so far. And, in my opinion, the consumer has not paid for it because of the devaluation by China. They devalued and they pumped a lot of money into their system. So, it's really been an amazing -- it's been an amazing period of time.
Yeah.
Only to help, I think, a lot of different groups of people. And we had a very good talk yesterday with China -- a very, very productive call. I think they want to do something. I think they'd like to do something dramatic. I was not sure whether or not they wanted to wait until a Democrat has a chance to get in. Hopefully that's not going to happen because the economy would go to hell in a handbasket very fast.
But they really would like to make a deal. The call itself was very productive. I'm not sure if it was the tariffs or the call, but the call was very productive. Again, they've said this many times; they've said they're going to buy farm products. So far, they've disappointed me with the truth. They haven't been truthful, or, let's say, they've certainly delayed the decision.
But it's their intention to buy a lot of farm product. And we did -- we had a very good call with China. I mean, they would really like to do -- as you know, they have a problem in Hong Kong, but they would like very much to do something.
No, we're doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customers, which, so far, they've had virtually none. The only impact has been that we've collected almost $60 billion from China -- compliments of China. But just in case they might have an impact on people, what we've done is we've delayed it so that they won't be relevant for the Christmas shopping season.
Yeah, he's a very highly respected, conservative pundit. He's a big Trump fan. That was a retweet. That wasn't from me; that was from him. But he's a man who has half a million followers. A lot of followers. And he's respected. And, as you know, Bill Barr wants to do an entire investigation of the whole Epstein matter, what happened.
He's been going on for a long -- that's been going on for a long time, the whole Epstein episode. And I know it's under investigation by Attorney General Barr, and I'm sure he's going to be handling it. The retweet, which is what it was -- it was a retweet -- was from somebody that's a very respected, conservative pundit.
So I think that was fine. Yeah.
No, basically what we're saying is we want an investigation. I want a full investigation, and that's what I absolutely am demanding. That's what our Attorney General -- our great Attorney General -- is doing. He's doing a full investigation.
The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation. Very tough. We'll see what happens. But I'm sure it'll work out. I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way. I hope it works out for everybody.
Oh, it's a very tricky situation. I think it'll work out. And I hope it works out for liberty. I hope it works out for everybody, including China. I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurts. I hope nobody gets killed.
Well, I've always been optimistic. My only question is whether or not they were willing to wait and take the chance on winning the election and deal with somebody who's weak and ineffective and doesn't know what he's doing or she's doing, like they've had in the past. This should have been done 25 years ago.
It should have been done 10 years ago or 5 years ago. This should have been done a long time ago. This should have been done by Biden and Obama. China is taking out $500 billion a year, and much more than that, if you include the theft of intellectual property. What I'm doing now should have been done many years ago.
Well, I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer -- you know, it's about ""America First."" I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer paying for people to come into the United States. So what we've done is institute what took place many, many years ago -- at our founding, virtually.
But we are just reinstituting it. And I think it's long overdue. I am tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things. So I think we're doing it right.
I think that what Chris Cuomo did was horrible. His language was horrible. He looked like a total, out-of-control animal. He lost it. And, frankly, I don't think anybody should defend him because he spews lies every night. So I don't know why anybody would defend him. But Chris Cuomo was out of control.
I watched it. I thought it was terrible. So I don't know who's defending him. Maybe they didn't see it. Maybe they haven't gotten a full picture. But I think anybody that would have seen Chris Cuomo would have said that was a disgrace. You've never seen me do that.
Well, I think Chris Cuomo was so out of control that I would not have wanted to see a weapon in his hand. I guess his fist is not a weapon or he would have done something. You know, he talked about it but he didn't do anything. But I think Chris Cuomo was very much out of control, actually.
Well, Anthony was a guy who worked for me, who really didn't have a clue. He worked for 11 days. He made terrible statements and gestures and everything to people that worked in the office. I think you've heard Mercedes Schlapp talk about it in great detail. Anthony didn't support me at the beginning; he was with somebody else and then he went to somebody else.
And he only supported me after it was a foregone conclusion that I was going to win. I'm not a fan of Anthony. I haven't been for a long time. I think Anthony is really somebody that's very much out of control. And he doesn't have what it takes. I mean, he really doesn't. He wanted to come back into the administration for the last five months, begging me to come back in. I said, ""Anthony, I can't take you in. I'm sorry."" He called so much.
He's a nervous, neurotic wreck. He called so much, and I said, ""Anthony, I'm sorry. I can't do that. I can't take you in."" And I said, ""You got to stop all these phone calls. Too many calls, Anthony."" And I wouldn't take his call. And lo and behold, now he feels differently. But Anthony is upset because he wanted certain things.
The main thing he wanted was to come back into the administration. And as you remember better than I do, he was a disaster for the 11 days.
Well, we have tremendous plastics coming over from Asia, from China, and various others. It's not our plastic. It's plastics that's floating over in the ocean and the various oceans from other places. No, plastics are fine, but you have to know what to do with them. But other countries are not taking care of their plastic use and they haven't for a long time.
And the plastic that we're getting is floating across the ocean from other places, including China.
I am convinced that Mitch wants to do something. I've spoken to Mitch McConnell. He's a good man. He wants to do something. He wants to do it, I think, very strongly. He wants to do background checks, and I do too, and I think a lot of Republicans do. I don't know, frankly, that the Democrats will get us there.
But I spoke with Chris Murphy, Senator. We had a very good conversation. We'll see what happens. But I believe that Mitch -- and I can tell you, from my standpoint, I would like to see meaningful background checks. And I think something will happen. Look, it's very simple: There is nobody more pro-Second Amendment than Donald Trump, but I don't want guns in the hands of a lunatic or a maniac.
And I think if we do proper background checks, we can prevent that.
I have no idea. I know he was on his plane 27 times and he said he was on the plane 4 times. But when they checked the plane logs, Bill Clinton -- who was a very good friend of Epstein -- he was on the plane about 27 or 28 times. So why did he say ""four times""? And then the question you have to ask is: Did Bill Clinton go to the island?
Because Epstein had an island that was not a good place, as I understand it. And I was never there. So you have to ask: Did Bill Clinton go to the island? That's the question. If you find that out, you're going to know a lot. Thank you very much everybody.

Richard Graham,United Kingdom,2020-05-30,"I hope you can hear me better this time, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am grateful for the opportunity to join this debate.
As our debate across the country widens gradually from how to protect our citizens’ health to how to protect their jobs, this Trade Bill is important. Some 30% of our GDP comes directly from our exports, and they in turn generate many of the jobs of all of our constituents. This is especially true in high-value manufacturing and engineering, cyber and services, in all of which there are some great examples clustered around my constituency of Gloucester.
This Bill, which provides the infrastructure for our own trading agreements with the Government procurement and the Trade Remedies Agency, is part of our plan to put our exporters in a position not just to recover but to grow again. Alongside the talks with the EU being handled through the Cabinet Office, and those by the Department of International Trade with the US, Australasia and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this Bill highlights some of the Government’s strategy to take this forward.
I support all the goals mentioned in the Bill, but at the same time we should be honest about the risks. Global trade is currently in decline. Nationalism and protectionism are on the rise. The backdrop is not as benign as it was for an overall expansion of our trade, growth of exports and expansion of jobs in exporting businesses. We clearly do need to finish the agreements with our allies, such as Singapore, Canada and Japan, with which agreements did already exist. Trying to negotiate separate agreements with separate teams simultaneously with both the US and the EU is high-wire trade diplomacy. I wish our ministerial teams and all the negotiators all good fortune in taking these forward successfully. I believe that many of these things will go down to the wire, and our teams should play tough. They should stick with the game, and we need their success.
It is also worth highlighting the opportunities from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is an important accession opportunity rather than an FTA. Even though there is some overlap, we should not forget the importance of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. TPP is not a complete substitute for continuing ​to grow our business with ASEAN in terms both of exports and bilateral investment. The way in which investment from the Philippines, to pick one small example, has turned around the fortunes of the Glaswegian Scottish whisky blender Whyte and Mackay is a strong case in point when it comes to the advantages of inward investment.
May I encourage the Secretary of State, the Minister who in his place and their teams to focus strongly, as we go forward, on the Continent of Asia both for greater market access through economic dialogues, as well as on FTAs and the TPP, recognising that most of its agricultural commodities and handicrafts are completely complementary to rather than competitive with our own output. Our services, for example those providing health insurance for millions across south-east Asia, are hugely beneficial for those countries as well as for our businesses. Ultimately, that is why this Bill is so important: it is an opportunity not only for us but for our trading partners, and we are right to strongly make the case as to why free trade does matter across the world.

Andy McDonald,United Kingdom,2020-06-15,"Laws to protect workers are not worth the paper they’re written on if we cannot enforce them. The Government has been too slow too often in tackling the coronavirus outbreak and needs to up its game.
Workers need to be able to trust the Prime Minister when he says it is safe to return to work outside the home, and have confidence that their health and their families’ health will be protected.
Without full resourcing, there cannot be an effective system for workplace inspections, putting workers, their families and the public at risk, and undermining the national effort to fight this virus.

Bernie Sanders,United States of America,2020-03-17,"I don’t have to tell anyone viewing this program that our country, and in fact the world of facing an unprecedented series of crises. We’re dealing with the coronavirus, which is spreading throughout this country and throughout the world. We’re dealing with a growing economic meltdown, which will impact tens of millions of workers in this country. We are dealing with a political crisis as well.
And I think the main point to be made tonight is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering, what is going to happen to me tomorrow in my own city? Burlington, Vermont, laws have been shut down. restaurants shutdown, showcase centers shut down, schools shutdown. What happens to all the people who lose their jobs? What happens to the people who tonight are worried that they may have the coronavirus but don’t have the resources to get the tests they need or the treatment that they need.
So this is a moment that we have got to be working together and going forward together. And what I wanted to do tonight along with you is to talk about a series of proposals that we all working on right now and will introduce to the democratic leadership as to how we can best go forward. And in this unprecedented moment this will require an unprecedented amount of money and my own guess is that we’ll be spending at least $2 trillion in funding to prevent deaths, job losses, and to avoid an economic catastrophe.
So let me just go over some of the issues and we’ll be posting these ideas tomorrow up on our website, berniesanders.com. And this is what I would like because we certainly don’t know it all we want to hear from you, not only your ideas about how we can best go forward, talk about your experiences. In every state there is a different level of crisis, in every occupation there is a different level of concern.
So please communicate with us so we can get the best understanding possible about what’s going on in our country and how together we can come up with some effective remedies.
Let me start off with the basics and that is obviously from my perspective and I know from all of your perspectives. We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get the healthcare they need regardless of their income. This is kind of a no-brainer. It’s something that should have happened in our country many, many years ago. But in the midst of this crisis, what I believe we must do is empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency.
Now, this is not Medicare for all. We can’t pass that right now, but what this does say is that if you’re uninsured, if you are under insured, if you have high deductibles, if you have high copayments, if you have out of pocket expenses, Medicare will cover those expenses so that everybody, regardless of their healthcare needs, and I’m not just talking about the coronavirus, but their health care needs in the midst of this crisis, will get all the healthcare that they need. That is what we should be doing in this moment of crisis.
We need to make sure furthermore, that as we go forward, we are effectively prepared to deal with the healthcare crisis that we’re facing and that means that we need to make sure that the hospitals have all of the ICU units and the ventilators that are needed to respond to this crisis. What the fear is as you know, is that there will be a surge of patients coming into the hospitals and that we will not have the equipment that we need to deal with that crisis.
Now, in my view, I mean, frankly, it is incomprehensible why in the wealthiest country on earth, we are not better prepared, but be that as it may, in my view right now, the federal government must work aggressively with the private sector to make certain that this equipment is available to hospitals and the rest of the medical community. In other words, federal government must take the responsibility of working with the private sector and saying, you know what, this is a major priority. You’re going to get the job done.
And during this crisis, in addition, of course, we need to mobilize medical residents, people in medical school, retired medical professionals and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis. One of the great fears that we are facing right now is that doctors themselves and nurses themselves will become ill. And if our frontline defense in the medical profession is injured, is made sick, is not able to treat the American people, that’s only going to make a very difficult situation even worse.
Furthermore, and again, this goes without saying, it’s something that should have been done, It has to be done immediately. We must massively increase the availability of test kits, test kits for coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We must look to successful coronavirus testing models in other countries and throughout our own country and implement best practices here. And right now there are communities and states all over this country that do not have the test kits. It’s taking too long to get the results. We’ve got to aggressively address that.
In my view, we need to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in the United States of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our healthcare workers need. It is again, quite unbelievable, but we have a short supply of masks, and if the doctors and nurses don’t have the masks that they need, it’s going to be very difficult for them to provide the care that patients require.
We need to utilize the national guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and other military resources to deal with this crisis. Today our armed forces must be immediately activated to build mobile hospitals and testing facilities, assist providers reopen hospitals that have been shut down and expand our healthcare capacity in underserved areas. One of the ongoing crisis is that our healthcare system faces in many parts of this country under the best of times, people can’t find a doctor or a hospital 200 miles away from them. That’s not acceptable and we have to address that reality in the midst of this crisis today.
We need to dramatically expand community health centers, which provide primary care, dental care and mental health care, as well as low cost prescription drugs to nearly 30 million Americans, including some of the poorest and most vulnerable. We have a primary healthcare system which is in very, very bad shape. Even people who have insurance having a hard time in many cases finding the doctors that they need.
So expanding community health centers will be a significant step forward in making sure that there are locations where people can get the testing they need, get the treatment that they need, get the healthcare that they need in general. And while we are making sure that all of our people have the healthcare that they need, we must also respond to the growing economic crisis that this pandemic is causing.
That means that we must make sure that everyone who has a job right now receives the paychecks that they need and does not lose their income. As we speak right now, think about the millions of workers who are being laid off in the tourism industry, in the fast food industry, in the restaurant industry, in the transportation industry. These are folks who don’t have a lot of money as all of you know, some 40% of the people in this country cannot afford a $400 emergency. So people are sitting out there and they’re saying, “My God, what am I going to do? How do I take care of my families?” And that has got, got to be the major, major economic priority that we address. How do we take care of the working families of this country who are negatively impacted by this crisis?
Small and medium size businesses, especially those in severely impacted industries such as restaurants, bars, and local retail need immediate relief. We must tell these businesses who are being forced to lay off, in some cases their entire staff or possibly even shut down through no fault of their own, that we will not allow them to go out of business. The federal government will work with affected businesses to provide direct payroll costs for small and medium-sized businesses to keep workers employed until this crisis has passed.
In other words, bottom line here, most important point is workers need to continue to get a paycheck even when their businesses are shut down.
Further, we need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in America every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families. Now we’re throwing out a lot of ideas and when you deal with the United States Congress, you don’t get everything that you want. There will be picking and choosing here and there, but I think it’s important for us tonight to discuss the various options that they have. And one of those options is to make sure that people at least getting $2,000 a month check to take care of their basic needs.
And importantly, we must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible. In other words, we don’t want some kind of bureaucratic arrangement. We were talking about this for weeks and months and people do not get the help that they need. We must provide emergency unemployment assistance to anyone who loses their job through no fault of their own. Under the proposal that I am working on, everyone who loses a job must qualify for unemployment compensation at 100% of their prior salary with a cap of $75,000 a year.
In addition, those who depend on tips, waiters and waitresses and others, gig workers, domestic workers, freelancers, and independent contractors must also qualify for unemployment insurance to make up for the income that they lose during this crisis. I think as many of you know, unemployment compensation does not cover every worker in America. There are millions of people exempt from unemployment. We have got to deal with that right now. It doesn’t matter what work you’re doing. If you lose your job, you need unemployment.
Further, we need to make certain that seem as people with disabilities and families with children have access to decent quality food. That means expanding the Meals on Wheels program, the school meals program and food stamps so that no one goes hungry during this crisis and everyone who cannot leave that home can receive nutritious meals delivered directly to where they live. In other words, that’s as basic as you can get in America during this crisis, people must not go hungry.
We must place an immediate moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and utility shutoffs and suspend payment on mortgage loans for primary residences and utility bills. In other words, it would be unacceptable that people could lose their homes, lose their apartments, see electricity or gas shutoffs during this crisis, so they must be a moratorium in those areas.
Furthermore, we must restore utility services to any customers who have had the utilities shut off. Unbelievably in America right now, you’ve got a whole lot of folks who literally do not have running water in their homes because they haven’t been able to pay their water bill, they may not have electricity and that has got to be dealt with right now.
We must also provide funding for states and localities to provide rental assistance for the duration of this crisis.
In addition, we need to waive all student loan payments for the duration of the emergency. Longterm as I think all of you know, it is my view that we must cancel all student debt and make public colleges and universities and trade schools tuition free, and that is the view that I have held for a long time. But right now at the very least, we must make sure that nobody is obliged to pay their student loan right now.
Furthermore, we must ensure that the homeless survivors of domestic violence and college students quarantined off campus are able to receive the shelter, the healthcare, and the nutrition they need and connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. We must also utilize empty hotel beds and other vacant properties to ensure that everyone in this country is safely housed during this crisis. We cannot forget that right now, tonight, there are some 500,000 people who are homeless, some in emergency shelters, some who are sleeping out on the street. Our job is to make sure that everyone is safely housed during this crisis.
Further, we must protect farmers by suspending all farm service agency loan payments to protect farmers during this crisis, extend crop insurance and emergency loans to all affected farmers, extend rural development loans, and expand the emergency food assistance program to help alleviate hunger throughout the country and support our farmers during this crisis. We already have a major, major crisis in terms of family-based agriculture in America. Thousands and thousands of family farmers are losing their farms, we’ve got to stop that process right now during this emergency.
Finally, we must make sure that our response to this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street. Let me underline that. We must make certain that this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street. We need to establish an oversight agency to ensure that no one is profiting off of the economic pain and suffering of our people in the midst of this crisis. Any emergency credit extensions or loans to insolvent companies or industries as a result of this crisis must come with strict protections and benefits for workers, for unions and for customers not no strings attached handouts for large corporations and their executives.
During this crisis, we will ban stock buy backs and bonuses for executives. We will put conditions on this financial assistance to make certain that any corporation in America that benefits from emergency aid does not lay off workers, pays workers a livable wage and does not rip off consumers. We must make sure that companies they get bailouts are required to sell equity to the government and put workers on their board of directors.
We need to prevent price gouging by pharmaceutical companies. As soon as coronavirus vaccine is developed, it must be sold for free. This is not an opportunity for some drug companies to make a fortune by charging an outrageous price for the medicine that people need in order to stay alive.
Further all prescription drugs that are developed with taxpayer dollars must be sold at a reasonable price. The pharmaceutical industry must be told in no uncertain terms that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost. This is not the time for profiteering or price gouging.
So we’ve covered a lot of territory tonight and this is what I would very much appreciate where I’d appreciate getting your help. Once again, this is an outline of proposals that I will be introducing to the Senate leadership and working with the Democratic leadership to implement. But it is important for me to hear your comments. We will have this outline up tomorrow in a little bit clearer way on our website, berniesanders.com. And in addition to that we need to know what you are experiencing right now. It’s hard to write proper legislation if we are not familiar with the kinds of pain and problems that people all across this country are facing.
So let me just conclude by once again thanking all of you for being with us tonight to understand that what this country is experiencing right now is something that we have never experienced in the modern history of this country. That is, number one, a major pandemic, which threatens the health and lives of millions of our people. And on top of that, an economic crisis which threatens the jobs and the income of many, many, many millions of people.
So we got some major crises, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as one people, remembering those who are hurting tonight and will be hurting in the future. This is the richest country in the history of the world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources, we can do it. We can address this crisis. We can minimize the pain and let us do just that.
So let us go forward together and I look forward to continuing to communicate with you, to tell you where we are coming from, what our ideas are, and look forward to hearing from you as to what your ideas are and what your situation is. So once again, thank you very much for joining us this evening. Good night.
",Bernie Sanders Coronavirus Speech Transcript on Primary Night March 17,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/bernie-sanders-coronavirus-speech-transcript-on-primary-night-march-17
Anneliese Dodds,United Kingdom,2020-07-03,"Back in March, as lockdown began, hastily written notes were placed in the windows of shops and businesses on high streets across the country.
They announced an unavoidable shut down with no certainty about how or when they could re-open.
This is every business’ nightmare, but for three long months, it has been their waking reality.
Now, for some parts of our economy, the notes are beginning to come down, and the shutters are beginning to come up.
But for others, the crisis is still not over.
We are still in the middle of the greatest crisis in a generation one where our government, sadly, has been too slow to act. Too slow to lockdown. Too slow to ramp up testing. And too slow to get PPE to our brilliant frontline workers.
As lockdown restrictions begin to ease, attention is turning to the economic impact of coronavirus.
Labour is very clear: the government cannot afford to be too slow.
Britain needs a Back to Work Budget with a focus on jobs, jobs and jobs again.
What we are hearing from the government on the economy is worrying.
Worrying that – yet again – they plan to take a hands-off approach to helping business and people’s livelihoods.
Worrying that some press reports suggested the Chancellor was considering putting off his Summer Economic Update, in order to wait and see what happens this weekend, when more of the lockdown lifts. Even though many other countries announced weeks ago, their recovery packages, focused on backing the green jobs of the future.
Waiting to see is not a strategy.
And, that unemployment levels in the UK could be the second worst in the industrialised world.
Just as the hit to our population’s health from coronavirus threatens to be one of the worst of all industrialised countries, so our economy stands at a crossroads.
This is not a time to wait and see.
In Leicester this week we have seen the first major re-imposition of lockdown.
The government promised these lockdowns would be local.
But the reality is they are being driven from Whitehall.
We still do not have a functioning track, trace and isolate system.
And local authorities are not getting the data they need in the time they need it.
The experience in recent days and weeks in Leicester is a familiar one in our response to this crisis. Muddled. Confusing. With a refusal to bring in local authorities and too slow – much – much too slow.
We desperately need and want government to get this right.
Lives and livelihoods depend upon it.
Because for as long as there is confusion and delay in the public health response, many people will stay away from our high streets and out of our shops, pubs and restaurants.
At this time of continued national crisis, Labour is determined to act as a constructive opposition.
So, in that spirit, I call on the Chancellor to acknowledge the impact of the slow health response on our economy and do something about it.
Today we call on government, to lay out plans to extend support schemes for businesses and people in areas like Leicester that are forced into local lockdowns.
These support schemes should serve as economic sandbags, ensuring localised second waves of COVID-19 don’t wash away businesses and jobs in their wake.
These solutions are critical to reducing infection and to building trust and aiding our economic recovery.
We have also set out the fiscal measures Government should take, to first secure, and then turbocharge our recovery.
Instead of the limited ‘Summer Economic Update’ promised next week, we need a real Back to Work Budget.
It must focus on preventing unemployment, supporting the unemployed back into work, and creating the jobs of the future, so that when we emerge from this crisis, Britain is ready to come back even better than before.
We already know many of the policies which can prevent and combat unemployment, and the long-term costs unemployment incurs.
And we know that many other countries announced their economic recovery packages not just days, but weeks ago.
Already we are falling behind others.
This is no time to wait and see: it’s the time to act in our country’s interest.
Labour supported the Job Protection Scheme and self-employed schemes – indeed, we called for them.
We also called for an exit strategy.
But as with the lifting of lockdown, what we have now is an exit without a strategy.
First, government must abandon its one-size-fits-all wind-down of the Job Protection and self-employed schemes.
We need a targeted strategy that acknowledges that workers in struggling sectors cannot and should not be treated the same way, as workers in sectors that are already back to full capacity.
This is not about ‘picking winners’, in the Chancellor’s words.
It is about protecting those who have lost – through no fault of their own. It is about giving people across the country a fair chance.
The reward for months of sacrifice cannot be a redundancy notice.
This week we saw a wave of companies announcing enormous job losses – because the government is refusing to shift from its one-size-fits-all approach.
Smaller companies have a shorter redundancy period. To avoid the same flood of redundancy notices for workers within smaller companies later on this month, government must act now – and abandon its one-size-fits-all approach.
When we talk about our economy, it can feel distant and remote: interest rates and budgets and spreadsheets. It is anything but.
The economy is our jobs and family incomes.
It is our high streets and our communities.
It is the things that add meaning and character to the places we live and love.
It is small business owners, who have put their life and soul into building their businesses.
It has been heartbreaking to hear from many of them in recent weeks. How they feel their businesses slipping through their fingers because of a temporary lack of cash flow, even though with the right, targeted support now, they would be perfectly viable in the long term.
That frustration, that anger, at working hard all your life, playing by the rules, doing the right thing, waiting your place patiently in the queue. Only to find it snatched away from you by a combination of this terrible crisis and government’s refusal to help.
Supporting them now isn’t about picking winners.
It’s about basic fairness.
Government must also act now to provide support for those who have become unemployed.
Instead, the DWP are re-introducing sanctions at a time when there are more than eight people unemployed for every vacancy.
This government seems completely divorced from the scale of the unemployment crisis facing us.
It must speedily put in place the ‘active labour market policy’ that already operates in many other countries, and which our JobCentres do not have the capacity to provide.
Government must also act now to support the jobs of the future.
And here we need guarantees of delivery, not just warm words.
In 2015, the Conservative government promised to huge fanfare 200,000 new homes for first-time buyers. Not a single one of those homes was built.
The Conservatives have talked and talked: they have not built.
If you could construct houses out of Conservative press releases, promises and hot air, the housing crisis in this country would have ended years ago.
Instead, the rate of homeownership has fallen, and almost 800,000 fewer households under-45 own their own home now, compared to in 2010.
The Conservatives have talked and talked: they have not built.
And on the green infrastructure that every region and nation of this country is crying out for, there have been promises and paper commitments, but precious little action.
The Conservatives have talked and talked: they have not built.
Two years ago, the National Infrastructure Commission published an assessment. There has been no official response.
And this week the Prime Minister tried to claim he was creating a ‘New Deal’. Most of it was re-announcements of things we have heard before.
So, it wasn’t really ‘new’.
And, when we cut through the bluster and looked at the detail of what the Prime Minister was actually offering, it works out at less than £100 investment per person.
So, it’s not much of a deal either.
Ten years of Conservative government. Ten years of talk. Ten years of inaction.
Instead of yet more promises and yet more talk, we need a laser focus – on jobs, jobs, jobs.
To deliver on jobs, the Chancellor’s statement must meet four key tests.
First, it must focus, not on re-announced, re-hashed prestige projects, but on supporting high-quality jobs.
The test of a project can’t be if it piques the interest of the Prime Minister’s closest advisor.
Instead, projects must involve local firms. They must give the local workforce new skills and training. They must lead to material improvement in the quality and availability of local employment.
And, programmes to support employment must be measured against the success of schemes like the Future Jobs Fund, and reflect the different challenges faced by young workers, older workers, and particularly impacted areas of the UK.
Second, the Chancellor’s statement must buck the trend of the last ten years and rebuild economic resilience right across our country.
As a recent report noted:
And public support for ailing companies must come with good-value strings attached, to support local employment, to keep value in the UK by avoiding dividend payments, share buybacks and the use of tax havens, and to adhere to strong environmental requirements.
Third, every single project must be consistent with the drive to net-zero – so we can build the green jobs of the future.
Last week’s Committee on Climate Change report showed how far behind the UK is falling – now is the time for action.
Just as the German, Danish and South Korean stimulus packages have focused on green technologies, so must the UK’s, if we are to avoid falling behind other countries.
And fourth, any benefits of investment now must not be cancelled out by poor decisions later.
Because, while the Prime Minister says now that those who have borne the brunt of the crisis will not be called on to pay for it, we’ve seen the opposite over the last ten years.
Since this dreadful virus struck, we have seen who our key workers really are.
Those who staff our NHS; those working in our emergency services; those keeping supermarkets open; and the elderly and vulnerable cared for.
Our keyworkers are the people keeping bins collected, children educated, and the country safe.
Those on the frontline of this crisis have heroically risen to the challenge over the last few months – but, for many, that follows a decade of reductions in pay, security and living standards.
Over the last ten years, the gap in income and wealth has increased, and living standards for low and middle-income people have stagnated – at the same time as taxes for the very best-off have been reduced.
So finally, government must commit, at the very least, to not increase taxes or cut support for low and middle-income people, during the period while we recover from this crisis.
Because just like the small business that fears for its future, what people want – what they deserve – is fairness.
We cannot go back to business as normal.
We cannot “wait and see”.
We cannot have more empty promises.
We cannot have more inaction.
We need a response which recognises the scale of the challenge we face.
And the first step in this, the first move to get Britain back on its feet, needs to happen now.
Britain needs a Back to Work Budget – one that focuses on jobs, jobs, jobs.
",2020 Speech on a Back to Work Budget,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/anneliese-dodds-2020-speech-on-a-back-to-work-budget/
Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2007-11-29,"Well I am so honored and personally delighted to be here, and I want to thank Rick and Kay Warren for bringing us together this week around World AIDS Day. And I want to thank their tremendous staff and the volunteers and everyone who helped make this happen. I'm grateful for the opportunity to share our commitment about dealing with the global scourge of HIV/AIDS.
It's another example of the way in which this church is not measured by numbers. Yes, the numbers are big, they're certainly impressive. But it's measured by your impact. It's measured by the meaning that you give to lives here within this complex and so far beyond its boundaries. And the commitment that you demonstrate both to our faith in God and to doing His work here on earth is exemplary and that is one of the many reasons that I wanted to be here today.
You know, Rick has helped so many people with his lessons for a 40-day spiritual journey. But he knows those 40 days are just the beginning. My own faith journey is approaching a half a century, and I know how far I still have to go.
But I have been blessed in my life, both starting in my family and in the church of my childhood, to be guided every step of the way. A mother, who taught Sunday school and made sure that my brothers and I were there the minute the church doors opened. A father, who kneeled by the side of his bed every night of his life to say his prayers. A minister of our youth fellowship, who took it as part of his mission to show the group of white, suburban, middle class kids that there was a bigger world outside. And a prayer group that formed for me shortly after I came to the White House - a group of extraordinary women, both Democrats and Republicans, whose love and support sustained me.
I've often been asked if I'm a praying person and I have always responded that I was fortunate enough to be raised to understand that the power and purpose of prayer, but, had I not been, probably one week in the White House would have turned me into one.
One of my favorite passages in Scripture is that famous line in James that faith without works is dead. But I have concluded that works without faith is just too hard. It cannot be sustained over one's life or over the generations. And it's important for us to recognize how here, in what you're doing, faith and work come together. You understand that. Or as Rick might say: creed and deed! And what extraordinary important work your faith supports - fighting against spiritual emptiness, corrupt leadership, poverty, illiteracy, and diseases like AIDS around the world.
Twenty-five years ago, when men - mostly young gay men - began dying from a disease that had no name, we could not have, and certainly did not, talk about it in church. It would not have been proper. It would not have been polite. It would have been discomforting for so many of us.
But the disease itself was not polite, and ignoring it did not make it go away. It only made the problem worse, because the disease fed on ignorance and fear and, let's be honest, on prejudice. We are taught to heal the sick. To love them as our own. But twenty-five years ago, too many died alone, ashamed to tell their families what had made them ill.
In the Gospel, we learn that one-third of Christ's ministry was healing the sick. And if you read those moments, when Jesus is presented with someone who is ill, it becomes abundantly clear that Christ had a choice. He could have been too busy. He could have thought you know this is not the message of the day. I don't need to do this; I've already done it in Capernaum so I don't need to do it again. But he made the choice. He never asked why someone was sick. He just healed and ministered those in need.
That is what Saddleback has chosen too. Other churches, nonprofits, and governments have also chosen to heal, to help, to redeem. For many of us the Golden Rule calls on us to act.
And so we've come a long way. Not only can we talk about AIDS in church, but churches are leading the way. Thanks to leaders like Rick and Kay, Christians have embraced the sickest among us, and have fought the disease itself. We've had breakthroughs in treatment that allow those with this disease to live much longer, and we are hoping for breakthroughs in vaccines and other cures. But let us not grow complacent or too comfortable. Let us not feel that because we're here at this conference or as a member of Saddleback or some other church represented today that we are doing our part, because we have such a long way to go.
Here in America, we still have an AIDS epidemic. HIV infection rates are rising among gay men again and among African Americans and Latinos. The disease takes a disproportionate toll on the poor and communities of color. And it is an outrage that HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 34 in the United States of America.
Around the world, AIDS remains a plague of Biblical proportions. In too many places, ignorance about AIDS prevails and the stigma remains strong. And where ignorance and prejudice live, the disease thrives.
When I walked through the World Vision village, I was told the story of Kambo - a young Kenyan boy who lost first his father and his mother to what is called the ""big disease."" And for years his grandmother had told him he did not have it. But after the death of his mother, he began to sicken, finally was tested and found out he was positive. Even before the positive results came in, the boys he played soccer with began to shun him. It became increasingly uncomfortable to go to school. So the stigma is one of the real evils that has to be combated if we are to take on HIV/AIDS around the world.
We should take heart that the United Nations recently revised its estimate of the number of people infected with HIV downward from 40 million to 33 million. But please don't take any comfort. There are still 6,800 people infected and 5,700 who die from AIDS every day. AIDS is still the number one cause of death in Africa, where 90 percent of the HIV positive children in the world live.
Don't let anyone tell you that the time for alarm has passed. We can't slow. We can't rest. And we can't quit.
I've seen the tragedy of AIDS firsthand. From a dear friend, who told me in the early 1980s - much I must confess to my surprise in those days - that he was gay. He had the unnamed disease, and he died shortly after. To the twelve year-old girl that I met in Northern Thailand at a shelter for former prostitutes.
She had been sold into prostitution at the age of eight by her family for a satellite television. She was put to work in Bangkok's brothels. She contracted AIDS and was turned out and returned home to a family that would not take her in. She did find refuge in the shelter.
When I met her she was in a wheelchair, so weak she didn't have the strength to talk.
As I knelt down beside her, I could see the skin stretched tightly across her cheekbones. I thought of my own daughter and of all the girls her age who speak with such excitement about their futures, and about how cruel an injustice it was that this child would never know hers.
A week after I returned to America, people running the shelter contacted me to tell me she had died. To this day, I think of that gentle face and those warm eyes and what might have been done to spare her the fate she met.
She may have died on the other side of the world, but AIDS is not just an African problem, it's not just an Asian problem, and it's not just an American problem. And it's certainly not someone else's problem. It's a problem of our common humanity, and we are called to respond, with love, with mercy, and with urgency.
As President, I will wage the fight against AIDS with the passionate commitment it demands.
I will build on the funding levels in PEPFAR and on the leadership that the President and Mrs. Bush have shown, to demonstrate that the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria is an American commitment that exemplifies what we can do if we seek bipartisan solutions to nonpartisan problems. If we start acting not as Republicans and Democrats but as Americans again.
This is also a great opportunity for partnership. There are many churches and faith based groups here in our country and increasingly in other parts of the world who are understanding the urgency of this mission. There are many foundations and not for profit organizations like the Gates Foundation or my husband's work for the Clinton Foundation. They are supplementing what we are doing through the government, and they are doing what the government cannot do. And it is that partnership that is uniquely American.
When I was privileged to represent our country around the world, traveling to more than 82 countries, I was often struck by how so much of the rest of the world did not understand the voluntary sector in America. As Rick was saying, the private, the public, the parish - there was no sense that individuals would volunteer their time, give up their money to help meet a common need. But we are setting forth that example, as well, in the work that is now occurring.
By doing this, which is the right thing to do, we are also helping to improve America's standing in the world. We are putting a different face on our country; we are reaching out in a common search for answers. And we will be able not only to build on that work, to save lives, to prevent the spread of this disease, but also to create a broader platform for the values and ideals that we hold dear.
In order to accomplish my goals as president I have laid out a very comprehensive HIV/AIDS agenda. First, my administration will invest in treatments and capacity building by improving health systems across Africa and doubling the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatment with U.S. funding in five years. Everyone who is HIV positive must have access to these drugs.
I want particularly to target mother-to-child transmission. We know how to stop the spread of the virus from mother to child but we don't have the resources and the system behind delivering the drugs that are necessary. I believe we should do much more to encourage voluntary testing, but in order to do that it must be accompanied by counseling and there has to be a public education and outreach effort to undermine and diminish the stigma. Some countries are beginning to do this and we should encourage them.
Secondly, I'll invest heavily in prevention, teaching young men and women how to be responsible; how best to protect themselves. I visited Uganda ten years ago to highlight their A-B-C program, and it produced results. Abstinence, be faithful, use condoms if necessary. And this has to be a message that we do much more to communicate effectively throughout areas that are particularly vulnerable.
Third, I'll continue to invest in research to develop an effective vaccine and eventually a cure. There will be setbacks, as we have recently seen, but that doesn't mean we can afford to quit.
And finally, I'll restart the battle against AIDS here in America.
But I know that neither money nor government alone will solve this problem. Corinthians tells us that the body is made up of many parts, and ""though all its parts are many, they form one body."" Well we need, as though we were one body, to use every resource at our hands, our disposal.
Because as Kay and Rick have advocated, the fight against AIDS must be done hand-in-hand, building relationships with churches around the world and here at home. Because if we fail to engage churches in combating AIDS, we will fail to conquer AIDS.
As you have shown, there are six things churches can do: Care for those who are infected and their families. Encourage testing, even become testing centers. Unleash volunteers. Reduce the stigma by showing it's not a sin to be sick. Champion healthy behavior. And be treatment coaches for those taking medication.
I would add that churches also must tend to the spiritual side of this crisis. Because AIDS is not just a medical emergency.
Who will comfort the orphan dying alone after losing both parents to AIDS? Who will heal the emptiness that leads thousands of girls to be trafficked for a satellite television or a few dollars into prostitution and modern-day slavery each year? Who will provide stability and hope in communities devastated by AIDS? Who will welcome the drug addict using dirty needles or the gay teenager seeking safety and guidance?
Just as in my own life I need both faith and work to be whole - healing the world will take both faith and work as well.
We are compelled to address AIDS because it's the right thing to do. But we can also acknowledge it's smart, as well. AIDS is turning back the clock on the development that we have seen in Africa and elsewhere. It is destabilizing countries and undermining economies. In some places, AIDS can be even more destructive than war. It is watering the weeds of volatility and despair, and we should be planting seeds of hope and progress.
And nothing will help America more to win hearts and minds around the world more than showing America's true heart on problems like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In fact, we know our values are the source of our greatest strength.
As the PEACE Plan has recognized so clearly, however, we can't address AIDS in isolation. AIDS is deeply intertwined with so many other crises, and if we are serious about beating this disease, we have to address them as well.
To end AIDS, we need to end malaria in Africa. Malaria is overwhelming the health infrastructures in the developing world, accounting for 40 percent of health spending in many countries - money we need to fight AIDS.
Malaria is a challenge to our conscience in its own right. It is appalling that more than a million people die every year from a bug bite. And nearly all of them are children. A child in Africa dies from malaria every 30 seconds.
We made a decision to eradicate malaria in North America and in Europe. And we can do the same in Africa and Asia. So I'll set a goal of ending all deaths from malaria in Africa by the end of my second term. We can do this if we are committed together.
We also need to aggressively confront tuberculosis - a disease that takes the lives of so many AIDS victims before they should go. A disease that is mutating to become drug-resistant. That endangers all of us. It may start in Africa or in a prison in Russia or in some other far away place, but it endangers all of us because in a world without boundaries, people and viruses move freely.
To end AIDS, we also need to educate all the world's children. Education not only reduces poverty and improves health, it's a key form of prevention. It is what you might call a ""social vaccine"" against the spread of HIV/AIDS.
But today, 72 million young children - most of them girls - will not set foot in a school, and hundreds of millions will not go beyond primary school. In fact, there are more young children out of school in Africa, than there are children in school in America.
Every day we don't act, we deny more children the childhoods they deserve. We deny future mothers the ability to read a story to their children or a warning on a medicine label. We deny what is at the heart of human dignity: the power to learn, to discover, to grow, to reach one's God-given potential. So as President, I'll work to pass and then sign my bipartisan Education for All Act to help provide a quality, basic education for every single child around the world.
And finally, to end AIDS, we need to stand up for women's rights. AIDS takes a particularly harsh toll on women and girls - about 60 percent of people living with AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa are women. They are young girls who are taken in marriage or in rape. They are women who are abused and mistreated; who have no say in their own lives, who work from sun up to sun down; who never believed they have any way to speak up or be heard. Their societies and their country don't recognize their rights to health care or education. They don't participate in the economy in a formal way, although their work keeps people alive and thriving.
I remember once driving through Africa on a bus with a group of distinguished experts and in field after field and marketplace after marketplace we saw women working, women working hard, carrying firewood, carrying water, selling their products in the villages. And the economist said, ""Well, it's too bad that all of their work doesn't matter in the formal economy."" And I said, well, if they stopped all of their work, the formal economy would collapse. And it is time we pay tribute and respect to the hard work of such women.
And it is long past time that we do everything we can to stand up for the proposition that women's rights are human rights. As I saw so starkly at that shelter in Thailand, girls denied their human rights are girls at risk of AIDS. And even in our own country today, women are now the face of AIDS.
In 1995, I went to Beijing on behalf of our country for the United Nation's Fourth World Conference on Women. I said what most of us believe here in America, that women's rights are human rights, but it was considered a radical statement.
I remember being on the Voice of America shortly after I came back. It was a call in radio show that was beamed throughout the world and a caller from Iran called and he asked me â€˜Well, what did I mean by saying that women's rights were human rights?â€ And I said, I want you to stop for a minute, maybe close your eyes and think about all the rights you have as a man. The right to work, the right to pursue an education, the right to start a business, the right to be active in your country's affairs. Those are the rights I'm talking about. The rights that are the real core of who we are as human beings.
It's important we continue to work to empower women to take responsibility for themselves and their futures with initiatives on everything from maternal health to micro-credit and entrepreneurship. I'll continue the work I started as First Lady and now as a Senator to end the buying and selling of girls and women into modern-day slavery.
Now, I know this won't be easy. But I also know the power of America at our best, and I know the power of faith and of people of faith, when we heed Isaiah's call to lift up our voices like trumpets.
The faith community lifted up its voice against slavery and helped lead America to end that evil. The faith community lifted its voice against discrimination here in America and against apartheid in South Africa and helped end both. The faith community lifted its voice for debt relief for the world's poorest countries, and gave many countries a fresh start in the jubilee year.
Today the faith community is speaking out against genocide in Darfur. Taking on global warming and we can see from this room the awesome power to address the AIDS pandemic. Together I believe, we can write the next chapter in this history. It is a proud and grace-filled history.
Thank you, thank you to Saddleback. Thanks to all of you for the work you are doing and for living your faith in such a visible way. And I appreciate the opportunity to add my voice to yours. Thank you all very much and God speed.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-09-20,"Hello, Las Vegas. How are you? How is everybody? We love Las Vegas. Thank you. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in Nevada. You always have to say that name just right. With thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots, the people of Nevada love our country, honor our values, and always respect our great American flag.
And except for a lot of the fake news that you see from these people back here... America is winning again. America is being respected again. Because we are finally putting America first again. We have the best economy in our history. And I have to tell you this, if our opponent got into office, which would have been a very sad, sad period of time..... It is a pretty sad day, isn't it? Don't worry.
It's all going to get better. It's all going to get better. That's what was going to happen. That's what was going to happen. That's where it was going. Wages, right now, are rising and poverty is -- you see it. Poverty is plummeting.
Jobless claims just hit a 50-year low. Fifty. Five-oh. And the stock market today just hit another all-time high. We're fighting every day for our factories, our ranchers, our great miners, our farmers, and we are now the largest producer of energy in the entire world. And it's not by luck. We're rebuilding our military.
We're crushing the tariffs. And we're taking care of our great veterans. We're taking care of our veterans. First time in a long time. We've also just identified the first remains of our fallen warriors from North Korea, these incredible heroes, to now lay at rest in American soil. A lot of progress being made on North Korea.
Lot of progress. Do you remember, before I came in, it looked like we were going with war with North Korea? Now we made a lot of progress. Relationships are getting better and better. And we have our hostages back. And there's no more nuclear testing. And there's no testing of missiles and rockets over Japan.
We're doing well. And we're getting our remains back. Very important. We believe no American should be left behind. So we have midterms coming up. And you remember when we had that great, great election, almost two years ago. Can you believe it? And do you remember the tears from the fake news media, when it was obvious that we were going to win.
And you know what? They're still crying. Look at them. They're still crying. And let 'em cry. They don't know what the hell happened, but it happened, and that's why we're setting all-time records. That's why we're doing so well. But we have to get out for the midterms.
Promise me, you got to get out for the -- don't be complacent. You got to get out for the midterms. You got to vote. You got to vote. We need more Republicans. You know, when they say we have a majority, it's like this. It's like this. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority that day. It's like we have to have more Republicans in office.
We'll get everything we want, so fast. We've got to have it. So tonight, we are joined by some really terrific friends of mine and Republican leaders from the great state of Nevada, including two great candidates for Congress, Cresent Hardy, Cresent? Where's Cresent? And somebody that's been supporting me a long time, and he has shown such incredible stamina and loyalty and friendship, and we got to get him to win this race.
Danny Tarkanian, Danny? Thanks, Danny. What a great guy! Thank you, Danny. And, Danny, thank you for everything. You really are -- you've done a great job. Thank you, man. They're going to get you in. Vote for Tarkanian. Also, your next governor, a very popular guy in these parts, with a great family, Adam Laxalt.
Adam? And another friend of mine who really was outstanding, because, you know, I have a little -- to use an interesting word -- bias for this area. I love this area. You know the word bias? They've been talking about bias. Is there bias? Yeah, there was a lot of bias. You know that. But I have bias for this area and, also, for our great GOP chairman Michael McDonald.
Finally, I want you to please welcome the person that we're all here for tonight. Now, I have to say this. We started out, we weren't friends. I didn't like him. He didn't like me. And as we fought and fought and fought, believe it or not, we started to respect each other. Then we started to like each other.
Then we started to love each other. And the fact is -- and the fact is, he has been a tremendous supporter ever since I won the election. He's always been there. We can count on his vote. I mean, Wacky Jacky will never vote for us, folks. Never. She's wacky. She's never going to vote for us.
Oh, look at our judges! Oh, what's going on. And Brett Kavanaugh... And I'm not saying anything about anybody else, but I want to tell you that Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing or meeting.
A great intellect, a great gentleman, an impeccable reputation, went to Yale, top student, went to Yale Law School, top student. So we got to let it play out, but I want to tell you, he is a fine, fine person. So, he's got tremendous support. I can tell you that. Tremendous. Just like Neil Gorsuch, who's now on the Supreme Court, has tremendous support.
So we'll let it play out. And I think everything is going to be just fine. This is a high-quality person. And a man that agrees with that, and right now, his vote is more important than mine, because he's got to help Brett get in. And I'll tell you what? He respects him just like I respect him, but with Dean, we can count on him.
With Jacky, she's never going to vote for us. She may talk it. She even says, you know, a lot of the states like, where they like Trump, these candidates on the other side, they get up and they talk nicely about me, but they're never going to vote. They say, oh, Trump's wonderful, we like him a lot. You know, I won the state by like 34 points and they get up and they say, oh, we like him a lot.
He's great. He's wonderful. But they're never going to vote for us, so it doesn't matter. I'd rather have them say bad things about me and give us their vote. They're never going to vote for us. Because they're voting for Nancy Pelosi. They're voting for...
And they're voting for cryin' Chuck Schumer. Cryin' Chuck. Come on up here, Dean! Come on up here, Dean. Dean Heller.
OK. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Dean. And Dean really is a -- a champion, and I can tell you, I work with him. He's a champion for our workers, our families, and for our veterans. And we have to keep him. He led the charge in Congress to pass the most significant veterans reforms in half a century, including the V.A. Accountability Act.
You know what that is. That means people that work in the V.A. are accountable. If they don't treat our veterans well, if they don't do a good job, if they're sadists -- and you have that -- if they steal -- and you have that -- we say, sorry, but you are fired! Right? Before you couldn't do that. You couldn't do it. Now you can do it. That's been 45 years they've been trying to get it. It doesn't sound like much.
It's everything. So much. And, most importantly, 46 years, V.A. choice, this is where a veteran has to wait long periods to see a doctor. No longer. They now go and see a private doctor if there's a line. They don't have to wait for 12 days, for 20 days, for 40 days. They go see a doctor. We pay for the doctor.
And they get taken care of. They get taken care of. And Dean has led the effort in Congress to fully fund Veterans Affairs. It's a big deal. And he's been really great. He really has. So I just want to say, there's been no better friend. We started off slow, but we ended up strong. I've had no better friend in Congress than Dean Heller.
So, thank you. Thank you, friend. We've got to elect Republicans. That means our great congressmen, potential congressmen, and we have to get Dean to fight for Nevada, to fight for our heroes, and to help us make things honest around here. You know what's going on. So we're going to drain the swamp. Drain the swamp.
Early voting, so important. Early voting starts in exactly one month, October 20th. So you can vote early, but you've got to get out and vote. And remember this. Dean's Democrat opponent Wacky Jacky, Jacky Rosen, she doesn't get it. Jacky Rosen is bought and paid for by her donors, 100 percent.
She doesn't even want to go to a debate. We think she doesn't want to debate. I said, hey, Dean, when's the debate? And he said, she won't debate me. That's not good. That's not good. Rosen doesn't represent Nevada's values. She represents the extreme liberal values of her out-of-state donors, funding almost 90 percent of her campaign.
But even that, just so you understand, she's going to do whatever Pelosi and Schumer tell her to do, OK? It doesn't matter. They never vote for us. Jacky Rosen voted no on tax cuts. You know that? She voted for the disaster, which is really being changed rapidly.
You know, we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing. The disaster known as Obamacare. Jacky Rosen voted against Kate's Law.A. Accountability Act.
How do you do that? How do you do that. That's where she is. You don't want that. You don't want it. A vote for Wacky Jacky is a vote for the extreme agenda of those people, as Pelosi-Schumer-Waters is a vote for more taxes.
Seriously. It's a vote for more taxes, more crime, and more onerous regulation, which stops everything from happening. You know, we cut regulations more than any administration in the history of our country, and I did it in less than two years. And it's one of the reasons that you have all of those jobs.
It's one of the reasons that you can now go out and look for another job if you're not happy, because everybody wants to hire you and you're getting higher wages for the first time in 21 years. The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and open borders.
That's what they want to do. We've done a lot. We've rebuilt a lot of sections of wall in San Diego and a lot of areas. We're starting a big, brand-new section. We spent $1.6 billion, then another $1.6 billion. Unfortunately, sadly, because of the Democrats' obstruction, only $1.6 billion -- sounds like a lot, but it's not when you're talking about what we're talking about -- $1.6 billion was just approved.
I'm not thrilled, but after the election, they're all telling me were getting our wall the way we want it, so let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. Let's see if they produce. In this election, and by the way, we want that wall. We want that wall. You know where I am. I could knock it out, because I do that well.
That's what I do well. I build. We could knock that wall out in one year if they gave us the funds. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Schumer and these people, even though they know you need the wall, they all voted for the wall in 2006. They vote for border security. And then they found out, oh gee, maybe from their standpoint, they can't do that, but they all voted for it. Hillary Clinton voted for it, right?
Remember her. I'll tell you this. Everybody knows... We're going to get the wall. But it would be a lot easier if you get Republicans in there to vote, please.
OK? A lot easier. Because their whole agenda -- on bigger things we can get. You see what we've gotten. We've got things that -- we got $700 billion to rebuild our military. We then got $716 billion to rebuild it second year, $700 billion and $716 billion. But their whole agenda, they know we want the wall.
They want to oppose it. They want to obstruct it. They want to resist. You know the campaign? It's called resist. Honestly, they're lousy politicians. Their policy is terrible. But they're good at sticking together and resisting. That's all they can do.
You watch. You watch. It's all they're good at. Resist. You know, they see the signs, ""Resist, resist."" Ugh. They're for resisting. That's what it's all about. But this election, you have to vote for candidates who really know what your heart says, what your values are.
You have some great, great Republican candidates, and a lot of people think that I'm always angry at Congress. I'm angry at Democrats because of what they're doing to our country. I'm angry at Democrats because of what they do to our country. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by left-wing haters, angry mobs, socialist fanatics, deep-state bureaucrats, and their fake news allies.
This is the big -- that's their best partner. The Democrat Party, their best ally is those people right there. I can't even explain it. Impossible to explain. Nobody would believe it. Nobody would.
And I don't mean everything. You have some fine people. Some fine reporters. I know them. Fine reporters. Look, all the red lights are starting to go off. But I watch the coverage that we get. And it is so unfair.
We could have the greatest success, like, for instance, in North Korea, we're doing great. We're doing great, moving along. What do they say? There's nothing they can say. So they say he met with them. That's a defeat, because we met. They can't say anything else. We have the hostage -- they said he met! So many things they come up and then they say, oh, it's not moving fast enough.
They've been covering these Democrats for decades, they haven't -- they haven't done a thing. I left. What did I leave, three months ago? We're doing great. But these are people that will take a great story and make it as bad as possible. They'll take an OK story and make it horrible.
Without them, they wouldn't be getting 5 percent of the vote. I'll tell you. It's true. It's fake news. Fake news. And you know, I have to say this, when I won the election, we won. I didn't win. We won. The whole thing, we won. The New York Times, like, they apologized to their subscribers because they covered the election so badly, because their subscribers say, how could this happen?
He got nothing but bad stories, because people don't read the New York Times, because it's a dishonest newspaper. It's terrible. But I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. When we won, they suffered. But I said -- I said -- I got one thing that I was -- in interviews, I say, you know the good news? I'll start now getting fair press.
And it happened for about a week. And now they're worse than they ever were. But it doesn't seem to have much of an impact, does it. So the resistance, to an extent, because of them, is filled with anger, because their policies have been exposed as failure. Real anger.
The forces opposing us in Washington are the same people who squandered trillions of dollars overseas, who sacrificed our sovereignty, who shipped away our jobs, who oversaw the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. That's what happened to our country. And we're now recovering. We're bringing back our jobs.
We're bringing back our companies. In 2016, the American people voted to reject this corrupt globalism. Hey, I'm the president of the United States! I'm not the president of the globe. We are making America greater than ever before. And it's happening before your eyes.
Bitter Democrats and their establishment cronies have spent every single day since 2016 trying to undermine the results of this incredible, historic presidential election that we won together. So we want to keep it going. And we want to do it the easy way. So this election day, go out there and vote. You got to vote.
Everybody's got to go out and got to vote. I want to give a victory speech. I want to give a victory speech on the evening of Election Day, which is coming up very quickly. We're going to be talking about America. We're going to be talking about the greatness of our country. We're not going to let people undo the incredible job that we've done over the last almost-two-year period.
So, don't forget, early voting, folks, early voting, October 20th. Now, we need -- we need in this election to do something special. I'm not saying there's ever going to be a time like we just went through. And a lot of people say that you're complacent now. You win the presidency and you're complacent. I don't think we're complacent.
And I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what I did. I'll tell you what I did. Last week, I said update it. I said update it. I want to show you -- I don't believe there has been any administration in the history of this country that has done more in two years -- and we're not even up to two years yet -- than our administration.
Look at this. So I said just write down some of the things. Each one, each one, point, point, point, four-and-a-half pages, almost 4 million jobs created since the election, more Americans are now employed than ever recorded before. Think of that. Today, more Americans are working than ever before. We've created more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs.
Remember what President Obama said? You can't have manufacturing jobs anymore. That's good news. And we won big, 306-223. Remember?
There is no way, right? There is no way that Donald Trump gets to 270. No, we got to 306. Look, manufacturing jobs, which he said you'll never have again, I'm saying why won't you have it? We're not going to make anything? These are the best jobs. You know, manufacturing, they're, like, the best jobs, the most important jobs.
Manufacturing jobs growing at the fastest rate in more than 30 years. Economic growth, so they say, when I took this over, I'm telling you, it was a sick puppy. We were headed down. So last quarter, we hit GDP 4.1, adjusted upward 4.2 percent, right? Look. Point, point, point. Look at this. New unemployment claims recently hit a 49-year low.
You know what that means? Simple. That means people are working. They're working. You know this, you've been hearing, and now it's even better, African-American unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? Remember? Ha. Remember, I said, what do you have to lose?
People said, oh, that's not nice. I said, hey, I go through a chart, it talked about the highest crime rates, the worst education, the worst homeownership. I'd go through -- and I just looked up one night and I said, you've always been with the Democrats. Vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose? Remember that, right?
Right? Hispanic, any Hispanic here? I think so. Hispanic-American unemployment is the lowest rate in history. Any Asians? Asian? Asian? Any Asian? Asian-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded in our history. You've heard me say this. Women's unemployment, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, recently reached -- I'm sorry -- only the lowest rate in 65 years.
That's not as good. That's not as good as history. Soon -- this is important. Youth unemployment recently hit the lowest rate in nearly 50 years. So great. Under my administration, veterans' unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in numerous decades, whatever that may be. Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.
I mean, how good is that? Think of it. They live better, and it doesn't cost us anything. Right? How good is that? We have companies now under the pledge to America's workers, they're training, under our vocational programs, workers, there's never been anything like this. We have -- retail sales surged last month, up over 6 percent over last year.
We signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in the history of the United States. As a result of the tax bill, small businesses will have the lowest top marginal tax rate in more than 80 years. That's not bad. We got, through a little work and a little coordination, the United States bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
We got it. That was us. We just got the U.S.-Mexico-Canada -- we just got the World Cup in 2026. We needed a lot of... I told you about the record number in history of regulations, that's such a big deal. We enacted regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions so they can now go and loan you money again.
Last month, the FDA approved more affordable generic drugs than ever before in its history. And one of the things we did with the FDA is a thing called -- I love the name -- right to try. You know what that is? It was that, if you were sick, terminally ill, and we had a drug in the hopper that looked like it was really working out, this country for 50 years would not let you use that drug.
They'd say, no, it may harm you. Well, you're terminally ill, so they couldn't get -- and there was a reason. I'm -- not that easy. A lot of liability, a lot of everything, between the insurance companies and various different things, including government. I got it done. It's called right to try. So now, instead of if you have money -- if you don't have money, there's -- you just go to your room.
If you have money -- I know people, they traveled all over the world begging for a cure. We have the greatest medical people, the greatest medicines in the world. Now you have the right to try, and it's going to work plenty. It's a big thing. We just secured $6 billion for the new funding to fight the opioid epidemic, $6 billion.
You'll like this. We withdrew the United States from the job-killing, income-killing Paris climate accord. That was costing our country. And we have the cleanest air now in the world. We have the cleanest water. Remember this. I'm an environmentalist. I want crystal-clean water. I want crystal-clean air.
That's what we want. But I also want jobs to come to our country. So that was good. We secured a record 700 -- listen to this. We confirmed more court judges, think of this, than anybody. And we're going to get -- we just got Neil Gorsuch, I told you. We're going to get Brett. We've got great people. Look at this.
We moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. We're protecting -- remember they said you'll never get that. They said that about everything. You'll never get that, you'll never get elected, you'll never this. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner is Donald Trump. Well... Remember the tears? Crying, crying, oh. Crying, crying.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States -- this is on television -- and I say, oh, don't cry, please, I want to be happy. Don't cry. Now they're crying more than ever! Except you know they're torn. Number one, they're crying, but they're making more money than they ever made because of us, because their stocks are up. But you know what's going to happen with these -- I tell them, about six months after we start, six months before the election, they're going to endorse Donald Trump for president.
You know why? Because if they don't, those broadcasting companies, the New York Times, all of those, they are going bankrupt so fast. So they'll be endorsing me. They'll be endorsing me. So I could go on for page after page after page. Look at that. Page after page. And to me a big thing. We're renegotiating the worst trade deals ever made by any country at any time.
So, Democrats, I had to bring that out, you know, just boom, boom, boom, why not? Democrats want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens funded by the American taxpayers. Now, think -- just think. We get a lot of people from California that moved here, but how about this guy?
Wait. He announces he wants open borders, that means just pour in, and then he wants to give them health care, education, everything. You know what's going to happen? California is going to have a billion people within a very short period of time. Now, I think -- and somebody has to ask, who's going to pay for this?
And do you know how bad it's going to be? You talk about waiting on line for the vets, which we saw? You'll be waiting on line for 10 years. It's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Open borders, come on into California, all over the world they're going to be pouring into California. Republicans want to protect the safety net for the truly needy Americans, people that need help, not for illegal aliens that come in to our country illegally.
And when it comes to health insurance, Donald Trump and Republicans will protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We're going to do that. We want to do that. Democrats want to destroy Medicare with so-called Medicare for all. It's going to be bust before it even gets open. Robbing from our senior citizens -- you know that, it's going -- it's going to be one of the great catastrophes ever.
The benefits they paid for their entire lives are going to be taken away. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they paid for it for their entire life. They paid for it. The Democrat health care plan would force every American onto government-run health care and virtually eliminate all private- and employer-based health care plans.
In other words, you're going to have really bad health care. It's going to cost a lot of money. Their plan would cost $32 trillion and require at least the doubling of your federal income taxes, and probably much higher than that.
You will see crime like you've never, ever seen before. The policies of their party aren't just extreme. Frankly, they're dangerous, and they're crazy. So what I want you to do -- remember, Danny and Dean and these people, you're going to go out and vote, because we're going to take this country -- and we're almost there -- remember, it's make America great again, but very shortly we're going to be changing that logo to keep America great.
Keep America. And we're going to lower taxes. They want to raise your taxes. They want to double and triple your taxes. And we are going to save and we are going to cherish ICE, ICE. Democrats want to open borders, which equals massive crime coming into our country.
Republicans want strong borders, and we want no crime. So here it is. We're going to make our country stronger than ever before. We're going to make our country richer and wealthier, and in so -- you need that. Look at how well we're doing. We're not ever going to apologize to other countries for our great success or for our great country.
You now have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Nevada. And we're standing up for our great national anthem. So we're going to do things. And you know what I've been saying. We're going to start winning again. We're winning now much bigger than I ever thought at a much earlier level.
Who would have thought this was going to happen? We thought it was going to happen, but not this fast. Remember this. All during our campaign, I said we're going to start winning again. And you're going to have your representative, Dean Heller, and you're going to go to him, we love this, don't we? And you're going to say, Dean, please see the president.
Nevada is winning too much. We can't stand it. We just can't take it. And Dean is going to come to the Oval Office, he's going to say, Mr. President, please, sir, stop winning so much, the people of Nevada can't take it any longer. And what am I going to say? I'm going to say, sorry, Dean, we're going to keep it going.
Look, here's the story. We really have turned it around. We're respected again as a country. Every time a person comes in to the Oval Office, a president, a king, a queen, a prime minister, they say, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done with this country. It's true. We've never seen anything like it. All the time, I mean, I mean all -- almost all -- I have to be a little bit -- otherwise, I'll get -- almost all the time, they say congratulations.
Some of them are saying that they're emulating us, but most importantly, again, we are respected. We are really respected for what we're doing. And it's been a long time since our country has been respected. But we're respected again. I love the people of this state.
I was here a lot. I was here a lot. I was here a lot before I did this political thing. By the way, how did that work out? That worked out OK. But, please, remember, it can be very fragile if you have the wrong people in Washington, D.C. It can all end very quickly. Bad things can happen to the economy very quickly.
It doesn't take many bad decisions. And they will make all bad decisions. We can't let it happen. So I give you a pledge: We're going to work harder than ever before. We're going to work smarter than ever before. We are going to do things that nobody thought was possible. And that's already started. So, go out and vote.
You're not letting me down. I'm never, ever going to let you down. Thank you very much. We'll be back very soon. Vote for Danny. Vote for Dean. Vote for all of them. We need Republicans in Washington. We're going to keep it. Whether it's from Las Vegas to Reno, to Carson City, we need every Nevada patriot to go out and vote. Go out and vote. We will keep it going. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Good luck.
","Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Las Vegas, Nevada",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-maga-las-vegas-september-20-2018
Theresa May,United Kingdom,2015-12-03,"Wasn’t it great to say goodbye – at long last – to Abu Hamza and those four other terror suspects on Friday?
So let’s pay tribute to the work of the police, prosecutors and Security Service who keep us safe every day.
And in particular, let’s thank them for delivering a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games.
And let’s thank the officers of the West Midlands Police and others, who are doing such a good job for us here in Birmingham.
I’d also like to introduce my excellent team of ministers. James Brokenshire, the Security Minister, who did such good work in planning for the Olympics. Lord Taylor of Holbeach, our excellent minister in the House of Lords.
Damian Green, who will continue police reform and get to grips with the criminal justice system. Jeremy Browne, our Lib Dem minister who wants to get tough on organised crime. And Mark Harper, who shares my determination to keep on cutting immigration.
This year’s Conference marks the halfway point of this Parliament.
And I’ve been in politics long enough to know that every day counts. We waited thirteen long years in opposition.
We’ve been back in government for two and a half years. And in just two and a half more we’ll be facing the country again. Fighting for an overall Conservative majority and a Conservative government.
But now we’re half way through our first term in office since 1997, I think it’s time to look back at some of the things we’ve already achieved.
Welfare reform, so never again will it make sense to sit at home instead of getting a job.
Taxes cut for people who do the right thing, go out to work, and earn a modest wage.
School reform, so every child in Britain can achieve their potential, no matter where they’re from.
The first veto of a European treaty ever issued by a Prime Minister.
Proper controls on immigration, the first significant falls in net migration since the 1990s, and much more to come.
None of that would have happened without the Conservatives back in government. So let’s be proud of what David Cameron and this Government are achieving.
Everybody knows that our biggest task is the economic rescue mission our country so desperately needs. Dealing with a record deficit and Labour’s debt crisis takes time and it takes difficult decisions. We’re a government prepared to take those difficult decisions, and by doing so we’ve already eliminated a quarter of the deficit we inherited from Ed Balls and Gordon Brown.
My first job was at the Bank of England. So I know there isn’t a shortcut to economic growth, especially after a financial crisis and while our biggest export market, the Eurozone, is in such trouble. But government can lay the foundations for growth by keeping down interest rates, minimising business taxes, cutting out red tape, and investing in our infrastructure. And that is exactly what George Osborne and this Government are doing.
To those who think there is an alternative – that if only we turned the tap back on and started spending again, everything will be better – let’s remember what Margaret Thatcher said in 1980:
“If spending money like water was the answer to our country’s problems, we would have no problems now … Those who urge us to relax the squeeze … are not being kind or compassionate or caring. They are not the friends of the unemployed or the small business. They are asking us to do again the very thing that caused the problems in the first place.”
Mrs Thatcher’s words were right then, and they’re right now.
So let’s hold our nerve and be confident of what we’re doing in government. Because that’s how we’ll win the next election – staying the course, doing what is right and not just what is easy, governing in the national interest and making clear that the Conservative Party is the home not just of those who have already made it, but the home of those who want to work hard and get on in life.
Like you, I spend a lot of Saturdays knocking on doors. And one of the issues that comes up most often is immigration. Maybe that’s why Ed Miliband gave a speech recently and told us that it’s not racist to worry about immigration.
Thank you, Ed, we knew that, but it’s not what the Labour Party used to say. And we won’t take you seriously until you say sorry, admit immigration is too high, and support us in bringing it under control.
I want to tell you about our immigration policies and what they’re achieving. But first, it’s important to explain why we want to control immigration.
It’s not because, as the liberal elites would have you believe, the British public are bigots. It’s because, if we want our communities to be real communities, with a shared pride in our British identity instead of fragmented, separate identities, we have to understand that a nation is more than a market, and human beings are more than economic units.
It takes time to establish the social bonds that make a community, and that’s why immigration can never again be as rapid or on the same scale as we saw under Labour.
Uncontrolled, mass immigration undermines social cohesion. And in some places, it overburdens our infrastructure and public services. It’s behind more than a third of the demand for all new housing in the UK. And the pressure it places on schools is clear. We see it in London where almost half of all primary school children speak English as a second language.
And we must be honest about the fact that, in some cases, uncontrolled mass immigration can displace local workers and undercut wages. You know, the people who lose out under those policies aren’t the liberal elites. Several studies show that the people who lose out are working class families and established immigrant communities themselves.
When we came to office, we found that official government assessments assumed that there was absolutely no displacement of British workers by immigrants. No wonder all the Whitehall departments were lined up in favour of more and more immigration. So when we asked our independent advisers to look at the effect of immigration on jobs, they found that every 100 non-European working age immigrants were associated with 23 fewer British-born people in work.
And, by the way, Labour knew just what they were doing. According to Jon Cruddas, Ed Miliband’s policy chief, Labour were “using migration to introduce a covert 21st century incomes policy.” That’s right, Labour – the party of the working man and woman – admit that they deliberately used immigration to keep down British wages.
So we will reduce and control immigration.
We’ve put a limit on work visas. We’ve set a minimum salary for people who come here to work. We’ve made it mandatory to speak English if you come here on a marriage visa. We’ve set a minimum income level for anybody who wants to bring a spouse to Britain. We’re looking at the abuse of free movement of people across Europe.
We’re cutting out the abuse of student visas, which was a backdoor route into Britain under Labour. We’re accrediting colleges, restricting the right to work, preventing most students from bringing dependants, and limiting the time they can stay here as a student.
The student visa system was so badly misused that in the last year, we’ve reduced the number of visas issued by more than 90,000, just by cutting out abuse. And that means we can expect immigration to keep on falling. But we will keep on doing everything to get annual net migration back down to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament.
Last year, for example, I came to conference and I said “enough is enough” on the misuse of human rights laws. You might remember the speech – Ken Clarke and I spent the next few days arguing about a cat. I said we’d change the immigration rules to end the abuse of Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights. One year later, the new rules are in place and ready to be tested by the courts.
I still believe we should scrap the Human Rights Act altogether – but for now, we’re doing everything we can to stop human rights laws getting in the way of immigration controls.
I know there are powerful vested interests who will oppose our immigration policies every step of the way.
They argue that more immigration means more economic growth. But what they mean is more immigration means a bigger population – there isn’t a shred of evidence that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes us better off.
They argue that our cap on economic migration makes us less competitive – but the limit stops economic migration getting out of control; it hasn’t been reached once since it was introduced.
They argue, too, that we need evermore students because education is our greatest export product. I agree that we need to support our best colleges and universities and encourage the best students to come here – but to say importing more and more immigrants is our best export product is nothing but the counsel of despair.
We were elected on a promise to cut immigration, and that is what I am determined we will deliver.
Three weeks ago, the country was united in shock and grief following the brutal murders of Police Constables Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes.
Their deaths were a dreadful reminder of the risks our police officers take in protecting their communities every day: putting themselves in harm’s way, going into dangerous situations unarmed, not knowing what they might come up against.
We have the finest police officers in the world, and we owe them all a deep debt of gratitude.
The terrible events in Manchester exposed a hidden underbelly of organised crime in this country: criminal gangs, dealing in drugs and guns, laundering money through supposedly legitimate companies, intimidating witnesses and ruling communities by fear. Many of the thugs behind these gangs think they’re untouchable, and in too many cases, they have been.
Official estimates suggest that 30,000 people and 7,500 gangs are involved in organised crime in Britain, at a cost of up to £40 billion to our economy every year. And it’s not an invisible or victimless threat. The drugs pushed on young people on our street corners have been imported by organised gangs. They control the supply of guns and weapons and use them to intimidate entire neighbourhoods. Their huge profits are laundered through seemingly legitimate businesses so the crime bosses can spend their money, free from risk.
We’re getting tough on organised crime. Last year, we launched the first ever cross-government organised crime strategy, so we can bring to bear the full power of the state and its agencies against organised criminals. We’re already seizing more criminal assets than ever before. And we’re establishing the National Crime Agency, which will lead the fight against organised crime, child exploitation, economic crime and border crime, like human trafficking.
I’m determined to give the police and law enforcement agencies the tools they need to take on these gangs. For years, as part of their investigations, law enforcement agencies have had access to telephone records. But now, organised criminals, paedophile rings and terrorists are taking advantage of new technologies, communicating using internet phone services and even video games. That’s why we want to legislate to give the police access to the same information for internet communications as they already have for telephones.
Some say this is a charter for state snooping. I say it’s a nightmare for criminals.
The power would only be available when it’s necessary and proportionate, under the supervision of a senior officer. It would be regulated and overseen by independent watchdogs. And remember, we’re talking about who contacted whom, when and where, nothing more.
So let’s be clear: I don’t want to read everybody’s emails. As Home Secretary I’ve strengthened civil liberty safeguards – not weakened them.
But do we want to see criminals take advantage of new technologies? No. Do we want to see the internet become an unpoliced space? No. Do we want to see terrorists, criminals and paedophiles get away scot-free? No.
We are the Conservative Party, not the Libertarian Party. As Conservatives, we believe the first duty of government is to protect the public. That is why the Conservative Party will always be the party of law and order.
It’s because we are the party of law and order that we are also the party of police reform. And let me be clear: while we have the best police officers in the world, there is every need for reform.
We need to cut the bureaucracy and get back to fighting crime. So we’ve taken an axe to police red tape, saving up to 4.5 million police hours a year and getting the equivalent of an extra 2,100 officers back onto the streets.
We need to give the police the freedom to use their judgement. So we’ve scrapped all police targets and given them a single objective – to cut crime.
We need police forces to be run efficiently with their resources in the right places. So we’re rooting out waste, joining up procurement, and reforming police pay so we reward crime-fighting, not just time served.
Put simply, we need police forces that are single-minded about fighting crime.
But it’s not as simple as me, the Home Secretary, telling the police what they have to do. For years, politicians and bureaucrats have tried to direct police forces in places as different as the West Midlands and Wiltshire. It simply hasn’t worked. So we’re putting the people in charge of policing.
We’ve introduced street-level crime maps so you can find out what is happening where you live, and police.uk has already attracted more than 500 million hits. We’ve made beat meetings compulsory, so neighbourhood policing teams hold meetings with local residents.
But our most transformative change will take place next month. On Thursday 15 November everybody living in England and Wales outside London will have the right to vote for a Police and Crime Commissioner.
These are important jobs, and big elections. The Commissioners will lead the fight against crime in their communities, and they will have significant powers.
They will be responsible for setting police budgets and deciding how much the public pays for policing through council tax.
They will be able to hire – and, if necessary, fire – chief constables.
They will set the policing plan for their force area.
And they will hold their chief constable to account for delivering that plan and cutting crime.
But the Commissioners will be important figures not just because of their formal powers, but because their mandate from the public will allow them to get things done.
Another benefit of giving the public a real voice.
If the police and the local council aren’t working together to deal with problems like noisy neighbours, the Commissioner will be able to bring them together.
If the police need more support from local health services to deal with offending by drug addicts, the Commissioner will be able to make sure they get it.
And I can announce today an important new duty on Police and Crime Commissioners to make sure that victims have a greater say in the punishment of people responsible for anti-social behaviour.
We will change the law so when a criminal receives an out-of-court community punishment, the victim will be given the power to choose the form it takes. They’ll be given a list of options. They might want something restorative or punitive. They might want it to be carried out nearby or as far away as possible. But what matters is that the punishment will be chosen by the victim.
For too long, victims of crime have had no voice – but this Government is giving victims back their voice.
The most important thing about Police and Crime Commissioners is that they will need to stand up for the public and cut crime. If they don’t, they’ll be voted out of their job.
So when you’re telling people to decide who to vote for on 15 November, tell them to ask this: which candidate has the best plan to cut crime in their community?
We’ll be hearing from some of our excellent Commissioner candidates in just a moment, but the thing that sets the Conservative candidates apart in this election is their laser-like focus on cutting crime.
While Labour candidates use these elections to play politics, and the Lib Dems try to make up their minds whether they should even take part, our candidates are talking about how to help their communities by getting tough on crime.
The other important question is: which candidates have the track records that prove that they will be able to get the job done?
Conservative candidates include a former Air Chief Marshal, several magistrates, business men and women and former police officers.
Looking at Labour’s candidates, they seem to think the public are desperate for one last reunion tour of the politicians they rejected at the last election – Lord Prescott and the Has Beens, coming soon to a venue near you.
Labour were the people who told us it was impossible to cut police spending without crime going up, who told us it was impossible to cut spending and protect frontline policing at the same time.
They were wrong on both counts. Thanks to our reforms and the leadership of chief constables, the police are delivering and service to the public is being maintained.
Frontline policing is being protected, there are more neighbourhood police officers, public satisfaction is going up, and crime is going down.
Police reform is working, and the Police and Crime Commissioner elections are the next step towards our vision of police forces that are single-minded about fighting crime, and which answer to the communities they serve.
So go out and tell people to vote Conservative on 15 November.
The Conservative Party:
The party that will take the fight to the criminals.
The party of law and order.
The party that will win the next general election.
",2012 Speech to Conservative Party Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-may-2012-speech-to-conservative-party-conference/
Theresa May,United Kingdom,2019-05-22,"I became Prime Minister almost three years ago – immediately after the British people voted to leave the European Union.
My aim was – and is – to deliver Brexit and help our country move beyond the division of the referendum and into a better future.
A country that works for everyone.
Where everyone has the chance to get on in life and to go as far as their own talent and hard work can take them.
That is a goal that I believe can still unite our country.
I knew that delivering Brexit was not going to be simple or straightforward.
The result in 2016 was decisive, but it was close.
The challenge of taking Brexit from the simplicity of the choice on the ballot paper to the complexity of resetting the country’s relationship with 27 of its nearest neighbours was always going to be huge.
While it has proved even harder than I anticipated, I continue to believe that the best way to make a success of Brexit is to negotiate a good exit deal with the EU as the basis of a new deep and special partnership for the future.
That was my pitch to be leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister.
That is what I set out in my Lancaster House speech and that was what my Party’s election manifesto said in 2017.
That is in essence what the Labour Party’s election manifesto stated too.
And over 80% of the electorate backed parties which stood to deliver Brexit by leaving with a deal.
We have worked hard to deliver that – but we have not yet managed it.
I have tried everything I possibly can to find a way through. It is true that initially I wanted to achieve this predominantly on the back of Conservative and DUP votes.
In our Parliamentary system, that is simply how you normally get things done.
I sought the changes MPs demanded.
I offered to give up the job I love earlier than I would like.
And on 29th March – the day we were meant to leave the EU – if just 30 MPs had voted differently we would have passed the Withdrawal Agreement. And we would be leaving the EU.
But it was not enough.
So I took the difficult decision to try to reach a cross-party deal on Brexit.
Many MPs on both sides were unsettled by this. But I believe it was the right thing to do. We engaged in six weeks of serious talks with the Opposition, offering to compromise.
But in the end those talks were not enough for Labour to reach an agreement with us.
But I do not think that means we should give up.
The House of Commons voted to trigger Article 50.
And the majority of MPs say they want to deliver the result of the referendum.
So I think we need to help them find a way.
And I believe there is now one last chance to do that.
I have listened to concerns from across the political spectrum.
I have done all I can to address them.
And today I am making a serious offer to MPs across Parliament.
A new Brexit deal.
As part of that deal I will continue to make the case for the Conservative Party to be united behind a policy that can deliver Brexit.
9 out of 10 Conservative MPs have already given the Withdrawal Agreement their backing and I want to reach out to every single one of my colleagues to make the very best offer I can to them.
We came together around an amendment from Sir Graham Brady – and this gave rise to the work on Alternative Arrangements to the backstop.
Although it is not possible for those to replace the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, we can start the work now to ensure they are a viable alternative.
So as part of the new Brexit deal we will place the government under a legal obligation to seek to conclude Alternative Arrangements by December 2020 so that we can avoid any need for the backstop coming into force.
I have also listened to Unionist concerns about the backstop.
So the new Brexit deal goes further to address these.
It will commit that, should the backstop come into force, the Government will ensure that Great Britain will stay aligned with Northern Ireland.
We will prohibit the proposal that a future Government could split Northern Ireland off from the UK’s customs territory.
And we will deliver on our commitments to Northern Ireland in the December 2017 Joint Report in full.
We will implement paragraph 50 of the Joint Report in law.
The Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to give their consent on a cross-community basis for new regulations which are added to the backstop.
And we will work with our Confidence and Supply Partners on how these commitments should be entrenched in law.
This new Brexit deal contains significant further changes to protect the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and deliver Brexit.
It is a bespoke solution that answers the unique concerns of all parts of the community in Northern Ireland.
But the reality is that after three attempts to secure Parliamentary agreement, we will not leave the European Union unless we have a deal that can command wider cross-party support.
That’s why I sat down with the Opposition.
I have been serious about listening to views across the House throughout this process.
That is why when two Labour MPs, Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell, put forward their proposals to give Parliament a bigger say in the next phase of the negotiations I listened to them.
So the new Brexit deal will set out in law that the House of Commons will approve the UK’s objectives for the negotiations on our future relationship with the EU and they will approve the treaties governing that relationship before the Government signs them.
And while the talks with the opposition did not reach a comprehensive agreement, we did make significant progress in a number of areas.
Like on workers’ rights. I am absolutely committed to the UK continuing to lead the way on this issue.
But I understand people want guarantees. And I am happy to give them.
So the new Brexit deal will offer new safeguards to ensure these standards are always met.
We will introduce a new Workers’ Rights Bill to ensure UK workers enjoy rights that are every bit as good as, or better than, those provided for by EU rules.
And we will discuss further amendments with trade unions and business.
The new Brexit deal will also guarantee there will be no change in the level of environmental protection when we leave the EU.
And we will establish a new independent Office of Environmental Protection to uphold the highest environmental standards and enforce compliance. The new Brexit deal will also place a legal duty on the Government to seek as close to frictionless trade with the EU in goods as possible, subject to being outside the Single Market and ending freedom of movement.
In order to deliver this, the UK will maintain common rules with the EU for goods and agri-food products that are relevant to checks at the border. This will be particularly important for our manufacturing firms and trade unions, protecting thousands of jobs that depend on just-in-time supply chains.
The most difficult area is the question of customs.
At the heart of delivering Brexit lies a tension between the strength of our ambition to seize the new opportunities that Brexit presents – and the need to protect the jobs and prosperity that are built on an interconnected relationship with other European economies.
This ambition should not be divisive. There are many people who voted to Leave who also want to retain close trading links with Europe. Just as there are many people – like myself – who voted to Remain and yet are excited by the new opportunities that Brexit presents.
Indeed I believe that one of the great opportunities of leaving the European Union is the ability to have an independent trade policy and to benefit from the new jobs and industries that can result from deepening our trade ties with partners across every continent of the world.
But I have never believed that this should come at the expense of the jobs and livelihoods that are sustained by our existing trade with the EU.
And to protect these, both the Government and the Opposition agree that we must have as close as possible to frictionless trade at the UK-EU border.
Now the Government has already put a proposal which delivers the benefits of a customs union but with the ability for the UK to determine its own trade and development policy.
Labour are both sceptical of our ability to negotiate that and don’t believe an independent trade policy is in the national interest. They would prefer a comprehensive customs union – with a UK say in EU trade policy but with the EU negotiating on our behalf.
If we are going to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and deliver Brexit, we must resolve this difference.
As part of the cross-party discussions the government offered a compromise option of a temporary customs union on goods only, including a UK say in relevant EU trade policy and an ability to change the arrangement, so a future government could move it in its preferred direction.
We were not able to agree this as part of our cross-party talks – so it is right that Parliament should have the opportunity to resolve this during the passage of the Bill and decide between the government’s proposal and a compromise option.
And so the Government will commit in law to let Parliament decide this issue, and to reflect the outcome of this process in legislation.
I have also listened carefully to those who have been arguing for a Second Referendum.
I have made my own view clear on this many times. I do not believe this is a route that we should take, because I think we should be implementing the result of the first referendum, not asking the British people to vote in a second one.
But I recognise the genuine and sincere strength of feeling across the House on this important issue.
The Government will therefore include in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at introduction a requirement to vote on whether to hold a second referendum.
This must take place before the Withdrawal Agreement can be ratified.
And if the House of Commons were to vote for a referendum, it would be requiring the Government to make provisions for such a referendum – including legislation if it wanted to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.
So to those MPs who want a second referendum to confirm the deal: you need a deal and therefore a Withdrawal Agreement Bill to make it happen.
So let it have its Second Reading and then make your case to Parliament.
Finally, we cannot expect MPs to vote on the same two documents they previously rejected. So we will seek changes to the political declaration to reflect this new deal.
So our New Brexit Deal makes a ten-point offer to everyone in Parliament who wants to deliver the result of the referendum.
One – the Government will seek to conclude Alternative Arrangements to replace the backstop by December 2020, so that it never needs to be used.
Two – a commitment that, should the backstop come into force, the Government will ensure that Great Britain will stay aligned with Northern Ireland.
Three – the negotiating objectives and final treaties for our future relationship with the EU will have to be approved by MPs.
Four – a new Workers’ Rights Bill that guarantees workers’ rights will be no less favourable than in the EU.
Five – there will be no change in the level of environmental protection when we leave the EU.
Six – the UK will seek as close to frictionless trade in goods with the EU as possible while outside the single market and ending free movement.
Seven – we will keep up to date with EU rules for goods and agri-food products that are relevant to checks at the border protecting the thousands of jobs that depend on just-in-time supply chains.
Eight – the Government will bring forward a customs compromise for MPs to decide on to break the deadlock.
Nine – there will be a vote for MPs on whether the deal should be subject to a referendum.
And ten – there will be a legal duty to secure changes to the political declaration to reflect this new deal.
All of these commitments will be guaranteed in law – so they will endure at least for this Parliament.
The revised deal will deliver on the result of the referendum.
And only by voting for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at Second Reading, can MPs provide the vehicle Parliament needs to determine how we leave the EU.
So if MPs vote against the Second Reading of this Bill – they are voting to stop Brexit.
If they do so, the consequences could hardly be greater.
Reject this deal and leaving the EU with a negotiated deal any time soon will be dead in the water.
And what would we do then?
Some suggest leaving without a deal.
But whatever you think of that outcome – Parliament has been clear it will do all it can to stop it.
If not no deal, then it would have to be a General Election or a second referendum that could lead to revocation – and no Brexit at all.
Who believes that a General Election at this moment – when we have still not yet delivered on what people instructed us to do – is in the national interest?
I do not.
And my views on second referendum are well known.
Look at what this debate is doing to our politics.
Extending it for months more – perhaps indefinitely – risks opening the door to a nightmare future of permanently polarised politics.
Look around the world and consider the health of liberal democratic politics.
And look across the United Kingdom and consider the impact of failing to deliver on the clear instruction of the British people in a lawful referendum.
We do not have to take that path. Instead, we can deliver Brexit.
All the changes I have set out today have the simple aim of building support in Parliament to do that.
I believe there is a majority to be won for a Brexit deal in the House of Commons. And by passing a deal we can actually get Brexit done – and move our country forwards.
If we can do so, I passionately believe that we can seize the opportunities that I know lie ahead.
The world is changing fast. Our young people will enjoy opportunities in the future that my generation could have never dreamed of.
This is a great time to be alive. A great future awaits the United Kingdom.
And we have all we need as a nation to make a success of the 2020s and the 2030s. But we will not do so as long as our politics remains stuck in an endless debate on Brexit.
We all have to take some responsibility for the fact that we are in this impasse – and we all have a responsibility to do what we can to get out of it.
The biggest problem with Britain today is its politics.
And we can fix that.
With the right Brexit deal, we can end this corrosive debate.
We can get out of the EU political structures – the Parliament, the Commission, the Council of Ministers that are remote from our lives – and put our own Parliament back in sovereign control of our destiny.
We can stop British laws being enforced by a European court and instead make our own Supreme Court is genuinely supreme.
We can end free movement and design an immigration system based around skills that work for our economy and society.
We can stop making vast annual payments to the EU budget and instead spend our own money on our own priorities like the NHS.
We can get out of the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy, and design our own systems around our own needs and resources.
We can do all of these things.
And by leaving with a deal we can do so much more besides.
By reaching an agreement with our EU trading partners we can keep tariff barriers down and goods flowing friction-free across borders.
Protecting jobs, and setting our firms up for future success.
We can guarantee workers’ rights and environmental protections.
With a deal we can keep our close security partnerships – and keep working together to keep people safe.
We can ensure that the challenge of the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is met in a way that works for people on both sides.
This is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom.
Out of the EU, out of ever closer union, free to do things differently.
And doing so in a way that protects jobs, protects our security, maintains a close relationship with our friends and works for the whole United Kingdom.
It is practical. It is responsible. It is deliverable.
And right now, it is slipping away from us.
We risk losing a great opportunity.
This deal is not the final word on our future relationship with the EU – it is a stepping stone to reach that future.
A future where the people of the UK determine the road ahead for the country we all love.
This deal lays the groundwork – and settles many of the core issues.
But in the years ahead, Parliament will be able to debate, decide and refine the exact nature of our relationship with the EU.
Some will want us to draw closer, others will want us to become more distant.
Both sides can make their case in the months and years ahead.
The key thing is, decisions will be made not by MEPs or Commissioners or the EU Council – but by the United Kingdom Parliament, elected by the British people.
That is what being an independent nation state is all about.
Those debates, those decisions, are for the future.
What matters now is honouring the result of the referendum and seizing the opportunity that is right before us.
So we are making a new offer to find common ground in Parliament.
That is now the only way to deliver Brexit.
Over the next two weeks the government will be making the case for this deal in Parliament, in the media and in the country.
On what is best and right for our country now and in the future. And on what the majority of British people of all political persuasions want to see happen.
Tomorrow I will make a statement to the House of Commons.
And there will opportunities throughout the Bill for MPs on all sides to have their say.
But I say with conviction to every MP of every party – I have compromised. Now I ask you to compromise too.
We have been given a clear instruction by the people we are supposed to represent.
So help me find a way to honour that instruction, move our country and our politics forward, and build the better future that all of us want to see.
",2019 Speech on Brexit,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-may-2019-speech-on-brexit-2/
Mike DeWine,United States of America,2020-06-29,"I’m wearing a Reds mask that my wife Fran made. I’m wearing that today in celebration that there will in fact be a baseball season even though it will be short, so good news. Good good news. Today I’m earing an Otterbein University tie. Otterbein of course is located in Westerville, Andy Chow, Karen Kasler of Ohio Public Radio are graduates, so congratulations.
Let’s start with some of the updated information from today’s numbers. You start with the cases. Cases, 737. You can compare that to the 21-day average. Of course the 21-day average is going up because the case numbers are going up so we are seeing a continued increase in number of cases. The deaths recording 11. Hospitalization, 65, so those are up a little bit. A little bit of hospitalization today from the 21- day average and ICU admissions are up slightly as well. Those are the key data.
Let me talk a little bit more about the longterm trends in regard to hospitalizations and hospitalization is a lagging indicator obviously. Someone is infected, it takes a while to get sick, go to the hospital, but last week is a significant week. From June 21 to June 27. It was the first week of increasing COVID-19 hospital utilization in the state for over two months. We have to go back since late April was the last time we had this much, so we’re starting to go up slightly. The number of standard hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 positive patients peaked in late April and early May at about 1,000. They reached a low of 513 on June 20, so June 20 was our low. Just last week though, we had about 500 to 550 COVID patients in Ohio’s hospitals.
Now these numbers of course are not hospital admissions each day. These are just who is occupying these beds which from a point of view of being concerned longterm about having the requisite space. So we keep track of how many go in each day, but we also keep track of what the hospital capacity is and how many are in the hospital. So again, last week, we had about 500 to 550 total COVID patients in Ohio’s hospitals. This week we’re now at around 650. The ICU and ventilator utilization is still holding pretty steady, but we are seeing increases in those in some parts of the state.
The increase in COVID hospital occupancy is most apparent in regions 2, 3 and 6, and that is Cleveland, that is Dayton and Cincinnati, those regions. In other regions of the state, the COVID hospital occupancy had been declining but now appears to have leveled off. In the Dayton and Cincinnati areas the recent increase in hospital utilization does include standard beds as well as ICU beds and ventilators. Although COVID-19 utilization hospitals is increasing, I want to make it very clear, there is still adequate overall capacity available across Ohio. No region, no region has reached a concern threshold of 80% which is when the hospitals start getting concerned of overall utilization for ICU beds, so we’re not there, but we do know from lessons of recent history in New York City, Houston, Arizona, that this can fairly quickly change.
I won’t talk about the positivity number which we have talked about before and this is a slide that shows number of tests as you can see for each day, number of tests, and it also shows the positivity rate which was at … The last one was at 4.7. Now I know we have increased testing as you can see and we are very happy that we’ve done that. We’re not where we want to be yet. We got a ways to go but we’ve significantly increased testing and people have done a very good job across the state getting those numbers up. The testing is so very important so we can determine who has it because many people have it and don’t know they have it, do not really have the symptoms but finding out who has it so that they can be taken care of and also we can slow the spread of COVID-19 is so very, very important.
I know because I’ve gotten calls about it that people think, some people think, and are wondering at least if the increased cases that we are seeing is simply because Ohio is testing more. Certainly, certainly some of that is due to that, but the experts that we have consulted do not think it is entirely that. So what you have to really look at to make that determination or to get some idea of whether it’s caused completely by the increase in testing is you have to look at what we call the positivity. Positivity simply is of all the tests done in the day, what percentage come back positive. As we have talked about before, we have been running between 4 and 6%, not horrible. We would like obviously for it to go down, but not horrible but 4 to 6% is what has been average.
What we have seen though that we would expect to see, we were testing initially very restricted. People who had to have symptoms. People who think they might have had it, and as we’ve expanded it, particularly in the last several weeks, we’ve expanded it to anybody, and so as you expand that to beyond the group of people who have symptoms to a much broader group, one would assume that your positivity rate, would expect the positivity rate to drop. That would be the normal thing that you would expect because you’re testing not just people who have the symptoms but also people who have no symptoms at all. That has not happened. It’s not gone up dramatically but it certainly has not … It’s gone up a little bit but it certainly has not dropped and that would indicate that we are seeing an increase in COVID-19 certainly in Ohio. The cases do reflect certainly some of that.
We talked last week about the two … About two counties in Ohio that we’re particularly concerned and we remain concerned kind of on alert and that is Hamilton County and Montgomery County, Cincinnati and Dayton. In fact I was on a call with the vice president today and with officials at the White House and they specifically called out those two counties. They talked about a few other areas of the country, but they had a concern about those two. They told us that they would give us some additional help in these two communities. We’ll talk to General Harris of the Ohio National Guard in a little bit, but his guard has been out and they’re out today doing additional testing and I know the two mayors, Mayor Cranley, Mayor Whaley have both been involved and the County Commissioner has been involved in getting additional testing in those two communities but I want to talk a little bit about the data that we’re seeing in these two …
Additionally we are seeing an increase in additional utilization of other healthcare services. In Hamilton County and the surrounding Southwestern Ohio region hospital utilization by COVID-19 positive patients reached their lowest level of this epidemic during the first and second weeks of June. However, as I mentioned earlier, the number of COVID positive patients being treated in standard hospital beds, ICU beds, and on ventilators has steadily increased. In fact, in Hamilton County, the number of COVID positive patients has doubled, has doubled, from a low of 65 on June 11 to more than 130 this weekend. Very, very concerning.
Let me turn now, go up north, a little further north to Dayton, Montgomery County. We’re seeing some of these same flags when we look at Montgomery County. There’s a noticeable increase in cases over the last from an average of about 10 cases a day at the end of May to about 40 cases a day in the most recent week. The community is also experiencing early signs that more people are seeking medical care for COVID symptoms. For example outpatient visits grew from an average of nearly seven visits per day to 27 visits per day. For the hospitals in our west central region, the region that Dayton is in, the number of COVID positive patients in standard hospital beds, ICUs and ventilators has also doubled since the first week of June. Doubled. COVID specific hospital utilization is approaching levels not seen since the earlier peak of the pandemic in April.
To make sure we have enough hospital and ICU beds to treat everyone who needs care such as those who need emergency surgery or in a car crash or suffering from a stroke, we certainly need the help of all Ohioans especially those in Hamilton County, Montgomery County and surrounding counties to redouble their efforts to social distance, wear a mask in public and follow good hand-washing protocols. Again, that is not the only reason that we are concerned. We are obviously concerned about what goes on with our hospitals but we’re concerned ultimately, the most important thing is human life and protecting people, so what we are seeing in Montgomery County, what we’re seeing in Hamilton County is not good. We got an alert on basically, and we’ll talk some more about those counties in a little bit.
We continue to work on our plans to help schools reopen as well as plans to keep Ohioans healthy and safe at work and in their daily lives while the coronavirus remains with us. We are in the phase of sort of learning to live with the coronavirus and so we are working on the next phase, the next plans, which we will announce. We hope to announce in the latter part of this week. These new plans will take us into the next phase, a distinct and different phase of continuing to keep Ohio open as we head into the second half of 2020. As I said I expect to have an update on these plans on Thursday, so we hope to be able to tell you on Thursday what the new plans are as we move forward.
Therefore our administration will be extending existing health orders through the week, through the week as we finalize these vital plans, so no one should read or speculate anything into that. We’re just extending what we have right now for a few more days until we’ve totally developed the plan as we move forward.
Barring any breaking news, we will not be having a regular press conference tomorrow because Fran and I are participating in a virtual roundtable with the First Lady of our country and members of the Trump administration to discuss challenges faced by our nation’s children’s service system, something that I have been interested in since the time I was a young assistant county prosecutor in Greene County. Fran and I will be sharing the work of Ohio’s Children’s Service Transformation Advisory Council, which I convened last fall to conduct a top-down review of Ohio’s foster care system and to work on solutions, but I also look forward to hearing from other states and we look forward, I believe, that there will be young men and women on that call, on that Zoom call who have in fact been involved in foster care and have been part of the foster care system, so we look forward to that.
The pandemic has shined a spotlight on a lot of disparities in Ohio and across our country. It shined a spotlight on disparities faced by individuals of color and by those living in poverty. Tragically those same disparities are seen in Ohio’s foster care system, so as we work to right our system in Ohio, we’re greatly appreciative of the Trump Administration’s focus and the First Lady’s focus on these same issues and Fran and I look forward to telling Ohio’s story to our federal partners as well tomorrow.
I think one of the most troubling … There are a lot of things troubling about this coronavirus epidemic, but I think some of the most gut-wrenching things are wen I hear from families who have someone in a nursing home who are not able to visit with them. We put the order in when we started this to try to save lives in our nursing homes, cutting down on visits, cutting down on people going into the nursing homes. My job as governor is to do everything I can to protect the most vulnerable among us. Part of that job means putting measures in place to keep people safe from the virus. It also though means protecting those things that add value to life and visits by family members to nursing homes, to their loved ones, is certainly something that adds value to life and I know that this has been gut-wrenching for families, not to be able to see in-person their loved one.
We realized that the lack of in-person engagement with family and friends who live outside of these congregate settings may significantly diminish a person’s quality of live who is in one of these facilities, making visits necessary to address the person’s emotional wellness while safely managing potential physical health risk.
Today, we are announcing that beginning July 20, nursing homes are permitted to begin outdoor visitation so long as all safety standards are met. When assessing their readiness to permit outdoor visitation, nursing homes should consider the number of COVID cases in the community, the case status in the nursing home itself, staffing levels, access to adequate testing for residents and staff, personal protection equipment supplies and local hospital capacity.
Now having said that, it is our goal to have people be able to visit their family in nursing homes across the state of Ohio and we know that these nursing homes have to have a little time to get ready for that but we would hope that they will start doing that. I know some of them have already done it. The assisted living has worked out we think pretty well as far as we can tell and now we want to extend this to the nursing homes. We are in the process, and we will discuss this with General Harris, but we are in the process of testing every nursing home and the general and the National Guard are making progress. I know some nursing homes are providing their own testing. Our longterm goal is to test every facility and then have the staff continue to be tested and we’re working with the nursing homes to make sure that that happens.
So far as the visitation, once the nursing home has been cleared, once the testing has taken place, then that nursing home can in fact start opening up for visitation again subject to the basic standards that we outline. Let me just talk for a moment about this decision and again some of the things that we did. We looked at the impact on the quality of life a prolonged loss of connection can have on an individual. We looked at the requests and listened to requests from families and residents. We looked at and consulted with advocates and providers in the aging and developmental disabilities communities. We looked at guidelines for visitation jointly developed by the Academy for Senior Health Sciences, Leading Age Ohio, the Ohio Assisted Living Association, the Ohio Healthcare Association and the Ohio Medical Directors Association. We’re confident that our approach provides each facility the flexibility needed to access their readiness to safely facilitate outdoor visitation and to do so in a transparent way that keeps residents and families informed. The order and related guidance will be made available at coronavirus. oh.gov and should you have any questions after visiting your loved ones, you can always contact the state longterm care ombudsman and office within the Ohio Department of Aging at 1-800-282-1206.
We have planned pop-up testing locations to continue those pop-up testing. Those had been scheduled to increase access to testing in minority communities, underserved areas, although we always emphasize this testing is open to everyone. In addition to help meet the demand for testing in areas where cases are increasing, we’ve added more pop-up locations and this is one of the recommendations that was made by the White House as well I might add today. The Guard will be testing every day this week in Cincinnati. Every day this week in Cincinnati and on some days this week there will be multiple locations in Cincinnati. There will be testing, there will be testing today until –
… Cincinnati. There will be testing. They will be testing today until 4:00 PM in Canton, until 4:00 PM in Lisbon, until 7:00 PM on Waycross Road in Cincinnati today. On Tuesday, there are two locations in Cincinnati, one location in Bowling Green. On Wednesday, there are two more locations in Cincinnati, one at Mount Airy and one at Forest Chapel United Methodist Church. On Thursday, we have a popup location the afternoon at the Walmart on Smiley Road in Cincinnati and in Circleville at the Pickaway County Health Department.
Pop up locations are being added all the time. So visit coronavirus.ohio.gov for the most accurate information. At these pop-up locations, anyone can come and get a test. Please remember though, if the guard estimates how many tests they think they’re going to have, and they bring those, there is a possibility that they might run out. So we would suggest getting there early.
Again, visit our website at coronavirus.ohio.gov and click on testing and community health centers to find a testing location near you. Speaking of the National Guard, we’re going to bring General Harris in. General, thank you for being here. Good to see you again. And I want to start by congratulating you and your bride, Angela, becoming grandparents. Fantastic. I know that’s a… Friend, I can say that that’s a great experience. So general, thank you. Thanks for joining us and tell us what’s going on with the guard in regard to the testing around the state.
Well, General, I can’t thank you enough. And the men and women of the guard, as you know, several of them were in here at our last press conference and we got tested and it was certainly not a traumatic experience. They did a great job and we got our results back. So we know everyone will have a good experience. And we just would, again, urge everyone, particularly if you’re in those areas where we’re seeing a significant uptick in Hamilton County, for example, in Montgomery County, we’re also starting to see some in Cuyahoga County. We would just ask you to get tested.
But General, thank you. We’re very grateful to be with you.
Last week we heard from Dr. Rick Lofgren from UC Health about the situation in Hamilton County. And as we said, we focus a lot today on Hamilton County, on Montgomery County. Today, we’ll hear from Dr. Michael Doane, the medical director for Public Health Dayton, Montgomery County. The doctor’s professional experience includes clinical care research, 15 years living and working in the Spanish speaking Caribbean, doing community health development. He served more than a decade on the full time faculty at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, and has also served on the faculty of the Wright State University Masters in Public Health program. He received his medical degree from the University of Cincinnati. And he has a public health degree from London School of Hygiene in Tropical Medicine. Doctor, thank you very, very much for joining with us. We appreciate it. And I wonder if you could just kind of give us a rundown of what you were seeing in the county.
Well, thank you very much. Are you seeing anything else in the data about who is getting sick? If there’s any change I know we’ve seen in some other states, it appears as some of the more younger individuals, 20 to 40 maybe seem to be showing up more. Are you seeing that in Montgomery County or any change in that at all?
So you could get… I guess, someone who’s 20, 30 could get it. And then you may see another bump then beyond that, maybe to somebody older, I guess. In other words, person who’s young gets it and may go home. The classic case that I was talking about is if you’re 20 or 30, you need to worry not only about yourself. If you don’t worry about yourself, you need to worry about someone older or someone who has some medical problem that you might end up giving it to. And I don’t know anybody that… Even if they think they’re invincible, no one wants to hurt somebody else and give that to somebody else.
Doctor, any final advice as we move forward for the people in Montgomery County? You talked about it is a holiday and a holiday, 4th of July, is coming up.
Good. Dr. Doane, thank you. We appreciate it very, very much. Thanks for all you do for people in the county.
Thank you, Lieutenant Governor?
I wanted to say also that Andrew Tobias, cleveland.com, just tweeted me and said that he went to Otterbein as well. So congratulations, sorry I missed you.
Thank you both. We really appreciate it very, very much. We’re ready for questions.
Well, I think what you’re seeing in Texas, what you’re seeing in Florida, what you’re seeing in other states is certainly not what we want the future to be for Ohio, and I think that it should be a cautionary tale when you turn on the news, and that’s what the lead story is. That should frighten us. It frightens me as the governor of Ohio, and that’s why we’re working so very, very hard, frankly, to talk about wearing masks, to talk about keeping the distance. That’s why we’ve had doctors Skype in from Dayton, doctors Skype in from Cincinnati at the last two press conferences. We’re very concerned about what’s going on in southwest Ohio. We’re very concerned about Hamilton County, very, very concerned about Montgomery County. We need more people to wear masks. We need, when people go into a restaurant, when the people go into a jewelry store, when they go in and buy anything inside, they need to have a mask on. So these are the things that we know that we can do. As we used to say when I was a prosecutor, the jury is still deliberating. The jury is still out. We don’t have an answer yet of what our future looks like. We determine our future just as Ohioans determined their future during the early parts of this virus and did a phenomenal job. We have to do that now.
The other side of that is testing and we’re gung ho on the testing. We’re pushing it just as much as I can, and our capacity is going up. We need more people to show up, particularly if you’re in Dayton. Go get tested. If you’re in Cincinnati, go get tested. We have these popup testing opportunities out there. Please, please go ahead and do that. That’s why Fran and I did it the other day, and John, just to show people that, hey, this is not tough. This is something that you can do and it’s something you can do for other people just like wear a mask is.
So we’re going to have to see, Jim. We’re going to determine our future, but the one thing we’ve learned throughout this virus, and we’ve seen time after time, what we do now is going to impact where we are in two weeks, three weeks, four weeks. And now’s the time to get serious about it. We’re headed into the 4th of July. Look, this is a time when people get together. We’re not saying don’t get together, but just be careful. Be careful. This virus is still very much out there. And as we heard today, even for young people, we’re seeing young people get awfully sick. Sometimes the death rate is not real high, but some of them have gotten very, very sick. And what we don’t know and what the doctor indicated is, many, many times we’re not sure about what the longterm medical ramifications are about that person getting sick. They may survive. They may come out, but maybe they got decreased lung capacity. And what’s that going to, how’s that going to impact them in 10, 20, 30, 40 years. So we’re right in the middle of this game. We’re right in the middle of the game. We’re going to determine the outcome.
That’s a question I should have asked the doctor, but the answer that is I don’t. What the people in Montgomery County are telling me and in Hamilton County, the health people as well as our own people, is that this is community-spread by and large. In other words, these numbers are not really be driven so much by a nursing home. There may be nursing home numbers in there. I don’t mean that, but that this is community-spread, that is, spread in the community. People are not being as careful as they need to be and the spread continues. But I don’t know that there is any one answer. The impression I get from talking to the people on the ground and people who are looking at the numbers is that there’s no one particular answer to that. It is basically community-spread that is occurring.
Taking them in reverse order, Jack, we have no indication that 40% of these tests are wrong. I mean, all the medical experts that we’re talking to, all the lab people we’re talking to, it certainly gives us no indication that there’s a huge of false positive numbers coming up. Again, the medical experts would be the ones to ask that and not me, but no one is telling me that. No one’s giving me that indication.
Number two, in regard to deferred care, I’m sure that you’re right in the sense that there are people going into the hospitals for deferred care, and we want them frankly to do more of that and to catch up, but the numbers I cited, the numbers we referenced are COVID-related. So those are separate from the numbers of the people who were in the hospital. So we look at how COVID is starting to increase, so that’s how the numbers we look at. And I’ll go back to the kind of the bigger question that you raised, and again, I don’t pretend to be the medical expert, but every medical expert I’ve talked to said you look at the positivity rate because it’s important. And everyone who I’ve talked to says that as you increase testing, you should have, if everything being equal, you should have a decrease in positivity.
So let me just kind of take everybody through that and maybe put it in words that I understand. And that is that when we started this, we were very restrictive in regard to who got tested for many, many reasons, unavailability of the testing or the scarcity of the tests. And so the people who were tested were people who had symptoms. You had symptoms, you got tested. Today as you know, we’ve thrown the doors open and we’ve said, please come. And you’ve seen numbers in Dayton. We’ve seen numbers in Hamilton County, popup testing. Anybody can walk in.
So when you go from a group of people who all have symptoms to a group of people who maybe some have symptoms, one would assume if everything is staying equal, as you expand your universe, the number is going to go down. That’s what every expert says. Our number is not gone down. In fact, it’s gone up a little bit. It goes down a little bit today, but it’s been fairly flat, maybe edging up a little bit. That is not what you would expect to see if things were staying flat. So that’s the answer that they gave me. That’s my understanding of what the facts are. Thank you.
There are seven metrics that the health experts are looking at. I will go through those next time because I don’t have them written down in front of me and I’m afraid I will say them wrong, but we’ll do that on Thursday. We’ll go through the seven metrics that are there that they’re using. And so when I come i as I’ve done last several times and say, we’re worried about Hamilton County and we’re worried about Montgomery County, that is not me looking at numbers. I mean, I can look at numbers, but it is taking seven different metrics and seeing how those line up and if they’re going the wrong way. For example, out of that seven, and I apologize, I don’t have them in front of me, but out of that seven, Montgomery County was going the wrong way on four and Hamilton was five. That’s why the alert goes up. That’s why the warning goes up. And we start talking about those two counties. We’re not liking what we’re seeing in Cuyahoga County, either, but they haven’t reached that stage according to the people who are health people who are looking at this data every single day.
So the answer to your question is we’re going to watch these numbers. And when we get an alert, we’re going to tell you that we have an alert, and when we become very, very concerned, we’ll see where we go. But again, the alert is out there today and last week, and the reason we’re talking about it is we want people in Montgomery County and surrounding counties and Hamilton County and surrounding counties to know the data is not looking good.
And so we can control our future. I can work on more testing every day, which is what we’re doing, and we’re getting a lot more testing, and that’s one way to run this devil down. But the most important thing we can do is what individual Ohioans do. And as the lieutenant governor was saying a moment ago, if we want to be able to go out and live our lives, this mask is a symbol of freedom. It’s a symbol of freedom because if we wear these, if we get 75 to 80% of the people who are out in public who are wearing this mask, we are going to see these numbers get better. And any kind of thing that we might do that you’re talking about, we will not have to do. This is what we need to do. We need to focus.
Talk a little bit about that on Thursday. We will, and I’ll go through the seven metrics and talk about what those are. And so that what we want people to do is to have confidence in what we’re looking at and what we’re relaying to people. And it should be, I hope, give people some confidence. There’s not just our team here in Columbus that’s looking at numbers. This is why we’ve had people in from health departments and we talked to health departments in Montgomery County, we talked to people in the health department in Hamilton County. We compare notes. We see where they are. And so we’re in agreement with them. They’re in agreement with us. We have a problem in those two counties.
Absolutely. In discussions with superintendents, I’ve said, what should you worry about? And if I was a superintendent, I certainly would worry about anybody, a student or an adult who had a medical problem, a compromised medical situation. I would worry about an adult. The older adult gets, the more dangerous this virus is. So every school has people that we should worry about. I mean, we’re going to worry about the kids. We’re going to worry about everybody, but absolutely. No, this has been one of the major things that we’ve looked at. And I will add to that, and it’s not mentioned very often, but when we talk about childcare, we worry a lot and try to be careful to protect those who are working there because you have those, some people who were working there just like in a school or any place else who might have vulnerabilities, medical vulnerabilities, might be of an age that their risk factor is significantly up. So we worry about the kids, but we also worry about the adults.
Yeah. I mean, the health departments tell me that the contact tracers are doing what they’re supposed to be doing and that the results are what we would expect. I mean, I was on the phone the other day with some health departments. I asked them the specific question, are they getting turned down a lot and is that a problem? At least on the call I had and the people I was talking to, they did not say that they were having a problem of anything above a normal rate of people not wanting to cooperate.
We continue to see what happens other places. We continue to learn about this virus. So it’s not like we can draw … the knowledge continues to evolve and the ability to evaluate it continues to evolve. Having said that, we have seven metrics which we’ll go into next time, and when you start to see higher numbers of these being reached, the concern needs to needs to go up.
The concern needs to go up and we’ll go through those numbers, not the numbers, but we’ll go through how that is calculated. So look, the big picture is this, what we hope is that people will do what they need to do just as Ohioans have done this throughout this. We’ve had a little summer now and people are out and sometimes people are not keeping the distance. They’re not keeping the mask on. And the cumulative effect is what you’re seeing in these numbers. So now’s the time to get serious about it. Now’s the time, if we want to be able to do things later, we’ve got to keep control of this. We just don’t want this to spike up and get out of control. And we know that what we do today, movement today is worth a lot more than movement in a week. And this is something, we have an obligation to tell the people in the counties impacted and throughout this state. This virus is still here. It is not over. And we got to get serious about it.
I haven’t any data, but I think any time, with as much community spread as we now have, any time you see groups of people together who are not keeping a distance and who are not worry masks, you can pretty much bet that there’s some spread going on. So yeah, I think that… I don’t have any way to quantify it, but anytime people are coming together and not keeping a distance and not wearing masks, you’re going to certainly see spread. I don’t think there’s any doubt about it. I can’t measure it, but there’s no doubt about it. And that’s why we’ve asked protesters. Look, we don’t infringe upon the first amendment, so we don’t infringe on people’s right to go to church. We don’t infringe on people’s right to go to a funeral, a wedding. We don’t infringe on people’s rights and put nothing up, no barriers. The same way with protesting and freedom of speech. But we ask them, think about your neighbors, think about your friends and please, please take care of yourself and take care of them.
Well, we’re taking a full look at everything and we’re going to have a whole, basically new plan to lay out for you we hope on Thursday. So we’re going to have to hold because I think looking at it holistically it’s probably the right thing to do. Look what people are doing, you’re seeing the same thing that I’m seeing. You’re watching TV. You’re seeing what’s going on. You’re reporting, of course. So look, some people are and some people aren’t and we just have to get more people to do it. And fewer people not do it. This is literally a matter of numbers and we don’t need a hundred percent. We don’t need a hundred percent social distance. We’d like it. We don’t need a hundred percent people wearing a mask. We’d like it. But if we get 75%, 80% of people, when you walk in a store and they’ve got a mask on, we’re going to be doing okay, and we’re going to get through this. If we don’t and we see it, Fran and I see it, we go in a store and don’t see that. So it’s a problem. And part of what we’re trying to do is tell people here are the numbers. Here’s what we’re seeing. Here’s where the spots are, where we’re concerned about it. We’ve got numbers moving up statewide. It’s time to get serious about this.
My persuasion isn’t good enough, or I’m not doing a good job persuading. I continue to work on it and I’m going to continue to work on trying to persuade all Ohioans that this really is the way to exercise our freedom. It’s the way to be able to live our lives. And that the consequences of not doing these things is a lot worse than the small inconvenience of wearing a mask and a small inconvenience of staying back. Now, look, I don’t underestimate it when you’re dealing with families, for example, and people cannot get together. That’s big, that’s big. Fran and I see that with our family. So, that’s the toughest part I think for people, but what we all want to do is be around for our grandkids’ future birthday parties and future Christmases and whatever holiday that we want to celebrate. And this thing will end.
And the other thing I would remind people that, I’ve had some people who kind of fatalist who say, “Well, everybody’s going to get it, or most people are going to get it eventually anyway.” Well, I don’t believe that, but even if you believe that you’re better off getting it next January than you are today. And you’re better off today getting it than you were three months ago. So the medical care is getting better. Understanding of it is getting better. There may be more drugs come out, who knows. So all the incentives should be in not getting it. There shouldn’t be any incentive to get it. And so again, life is full of balance and we all take chances, but they’re calculated chances. We all take some chances, but they’re calculated and we just tell people lessen the odds that you’re going to get it. No one can guarantee you won’t get it, but you can dramatically lessen those odds by doing what medical scientists are telling us each and every day. And I guess what I don’t quite understand sometimes and I get a lot of emails and a lot of texts, but why there’s just this disbelief in what scientists are telling us about the spread of this virus. And it’s not complex, there are things that we can do. They’re within our hands. They’re within our control.
We’re going to move towards more County by County. And I think you can tell that. That’s the way I’ve been talking in the last week or so. The data is good data. It can be broken down, not just by County. You can break it down by zip code and it gives us the ability to warn people, give them a warning, give them an idea of where we are, do an alert, whatever you want to call it. So, yeah, we’re certainly moving in that direction. We know more today than we did when we started this, but we’ll have more. We’ll talk more about that on Thursday.
Well, I’ve always said it’s important to wear a mask. I made the decision, right or wrong, that mandating at that stage when we were earlier, mandating that every Ohio an out in public wear a mask, was something that a significant number of Ohioans would not accept. So that was the decision. When we all look back at the virus in our rear view mirror, which is a day we are looking forward to, we could go through and look at the different mistakes that I have made as we’ve gone through this. And I’m sure that there’s going to be plenty of them, but I felt we needed to get back to work. I also felt that as we got back to work, we needed to put in place some good practices. We have good practices. I think we’ve done as well as any state in giving people guidance in how to open their business, how to open their profession.
But as many people told me, there’s a lot of huge consequences of not being back open. And there are some very, very bad consequences that impact people’s lives. So we are trying to balance this and we’re trying to do these two things at once. I think we can do them, but it truly, truly is in the hands of everyone who is watching TV and maybe a lot to those who are not watching in what we do. And we control our future. We do not want our future to be what we’re seeing in Texas. We do not want our future to be what we’re seeing in Florida. We can control it. We determine what this thing is going to look like in two or three weeks, but what we do today. So my plea to my fellow Ohioans, 4th of July wear a mask, by the way, I’m going to have an Indians one on Thursday. So we’re celebrating baseball, but we can have fun with these masks. Fran’s made this one. Sean’s daughter made his, and look, we can have fun with all of this a little bit, but it’s serious business. And what we can impact is the testing. And we were lagging in the testing. We’re catching up, we’re moving in that, but what people do as individuals is just vitally important every single day.
There’s going to be antibody testing. Look, it’s a question of availability, but certainly there’s going to be more. Antibody testing is occurring in Ohio now, but I don’t have any data on it. So I’ll take that as a hint to try to get back with you on some data.
Numbers. I mean, I actually, it does appear on my report. And so I can’t remember what the numbers are. It’s just much smaller number, of course, but I’ll get that for you or Dan can get that number for you. We can give you some numbers on that because we do have numbers on that.
Yeah. I mean, we’ve looked at this visitation in nursing homes for a number of months. We are now a number of months into this, which simply means that there’s a lot of people who have been locked up and cannot have visits from their family. And so we’ve weighed this. It has weighed heavy on me. I will tell you that. And on Ursel McElroy who heads up our Department of Aging and on anybody who has looked at this because these are tough, tough decisions. On the one hand, you do not want to introduce the virus into the nursing home. But on the other hand, I know, Ursel has has told me the number of people she’s talked to. I’ve talked to some, she’s talked to a lot more who just say that their loved one is going downhill in the nursing home. Some have dementia. It’s difficult to explain to them why that their mom or the son or daughter can’t go, isn’t coming. They’re not showing up. It’s hard to explain that to them. They don’t really fully understand because of the dementia.
So these are very difficult things. And so what we’ve outlined is a very thoughtful process. I think that virtually every group that has looked at it, we’ve gotten input and we’ve taken everything that everybody has said into consideration. So that once testing is done in the nursing home, and if they don’t have the virus in the nursing home, and other things have to take place as well. Then visitation can take place outside. It’s summer, weather is good enough that people can be outside generally for a while. And we know that the spread outside is dramatically different than it is inside, and that people wear a mask.
And we believe that with the proper precautions that this visitation, which family members tell me and I can fully understand is just very, very important to their loved one and their wellbeing, their physical wellbeing, mental wellbeing, that that visitation can take place in a safe environment. So tough call, good question. But you got to make these decisions. And again, we’ve had for a number of months, people who’ve not been able to see anybody in their family. So it’s going to be very carefully, very carefully done.
Your first question first, it’s not that we don’t have a concern about Franklin County. It just is not in that top tier today. That may change. What I’ll try to do, or what I will do is to give you a more thorough kind of description on Thursday of what we’re seeing with all the counties and kind of give you an outline of that. A far as the Health Commissioner’s comments, look, this is the type of discussion that needs to take place. The concern about why there is the spread, what’s causing the spread, is multifaceted. But having a discussion like that is very, very proper and very, very good. Our data is good, but sometimes it’s hard to drill down to exactly where that person got it. But that’s, again, something that we’re going to continue to look at.
So, everything is open for assessment, but again, individual behavior is the way that this should, and we hope, will get dealt with. So, when people go to a bar, there’s enough restrictions about they’re supposed to be seated, et cetera, that if people follow the restrictions, then they’ll be okay. But it’s certainly something that we need to look at.
I want to thank you all very, very much. Sorry we changed the date on everyone, but we got the invitation from the White House to talk about foster care, which I thought was very important. Fran and I look forward to that tomorrow. And we see you all back here we hope at two o’clock on Thursday. Thank you.

Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2016-02-01,"Wow! What a night. An unbelievable night. What a great campaign. This has been an incredible honor to campaign across Iowa, with so many of you to make the case for the kind of future we want.
For the Democratic Party and for the United States of America. There is so much at stake in this election, I don't need to tell you. Every single one of you who came out for me, who worked so many hours — from my young organizers with energy and passion to the families and friends across this state — I am deeply grateful.
I love all of you. Here's what I want you to know. It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now, to have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it.
I am a progressive who gets things done for people. I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough. That standing still is not an option. And that brings people together to find ways forward that will improve the lives of Americans. I look back over the years of my involvement from the very first job I had at the Children's Defense Fund. And I know. I know what we are capable of doing, I know we can create more good paying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking Americans again. I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man, woman, and child.
I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can make our education system work for every one of our children, especially those who come with disadvantages. I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people. And I know we can protect our rights, women's rights, gay rights, voting rights, immigrant rights, workers rights. I know too we can stand up to the gun lobby and get common sense gun safety measures.
And how do we do that? We do that by securing the nomination, and then we do it by winning and going into that White House as others before have, determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as Americans.
I congratulate my esteemed friends and opponents; I wish Governor O'Malley the very best. He is a great public servant who has served Maryland and our country and I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America. In the last few weeks, we finally began to have what I think is one of the most important substantive conversations that the Democratic party could have. And I am thrilled at all of the people who are playing a part in that.
I know that we may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals. But I believe we have a very clear idea that the Democratic Party and this campaign stands for what is best in America. And we have to be united. When it is all said and done, we have to be united.
A Republican vision and candidates that would drive us apart and divide us. That is not who we are, my friends. I follow their candidates very closely, I understand what they're appealing to, and I intend to stand against it. I will not — I will not let their decisiveness, their efforts to rip away the progress that we've made, be successful. Because we can't afford that. As I stand here tonight, breathing a big sigh of relief, thank you, Iowa. I want you to know, I will keep doing what I have done my entire life.
I will keep standing up for you. I will keep fighting for you. I will always work to achieve the America that I believe in, where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fades, but inspires generations to come. Join me, let's go win the nomination. Thank you all and God bless you.

But Hugh Hewitt is a talented guy. He's a great guy. He said very nice things about me. He said he'd rather have me than Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey or Tiger Woods. So when he says that, I like him, right. But he's a great guy. I think Hugh Hewitt is a great guy.
Well, I've always respected Ted, and I was very happy that he took back what he said. And, you know, I respect that, because a lot of people wouldn't have the courage to do that. Believe me.

As COP26 hosts, the UK should be blazing the trail in the global fight against climate change with a Green New Deal. Yet we are falling behind our European neighbours, whose investment in a green recovery has dwarfed this government’s.
With billions of taxpayer pounds being channelled by ministers into fossil fuels abroad and the UK still off track for meeting our targets, the Government’s actions are clearly still too piecemeal and inconsistent.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-02-28,"Thank you very much.
Well, and we're working toward something, but we didn't sign anything today. It didn't quite work out. I would say that I wasn't satisfied, and perhaps he wasn't satisfied. Good relationship, but I decided that this wasn't the right time to sign something. So, we'll see what happens over a period of time.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, whether it's Reagan, whether it's anybody, I mean, you have to be prepared to walk, and this just wouldn't have been good for our country. And, frankly, he could look at it the same way. Maybe he can look at it the same way. But we get along really well. He's a different kind of a guy, and I just said, look, this isn't going to be working.
So, I have feeling something down the line will happen. And it will happen, it will be good. But this just wasn't going to --
Well, let's call it both, let's call it both. I don't want to say it was my choice. It was something that he wanted to do and I didn't want to do it, and I just don't think it would have been good maybe for either of us. But we'll get something work out eventually.
Well, they wanted to denuke certain areas and I wanted everything. And the sanctions are there and I didn't want to give up the sanctions unless we had a real program. And they're not ready for that and I understand that fully, I really do. I mean, they spent a lot of time building it and that doesn't mean the world has to be happy.
But I wanted them to denuke, and they wouldn't do the full. They wanted to just some, and I guess a lot of people would have said, that's a great start. But I just didn't feel it was right.
Well, no, I just think he's -- first of all, he's a character.
And he's a real personality and he's very smart. He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader, and he's pretty mercurial. I don't say that necessarily in a bad way, but he's a pretty mercurial guy. But he was talking to the press a little bit, and, you know, he's not big to talking to the press, but the press came in. Look, bottom line, I think he wants to get something done but this wasn't the right time.
And Vietnam, Hanoi, where we are right now, they have treated us so fantastically, so good. They've done such a great job.
They're very proud of the job they've done, and they've really treated us, I mean, it's been an incredible two and a half days.
It's a much tougher deal to make, maybe it won't get made, but that's the deal that we should have. And you can't give up everything if you don't get that. Now, we could have done large portions, but you're not getting that. So, let's see what happens. Again, the relationship is very good. He likes me. I like him.
Some people say, oh, you shouldn't like him. I said, why shouldn't I like him? I like him. We get along great. We'll see what happens.
Right.
Right.
Right.
That's right.
A lot of progress, and it's a lot of progress, not necessarily on paper, although we actually signed a very good agreement. It said no denuclearization, you know, we're going to have -- that we're going to have a complete denuke. I call it denuking, but it's denuclearization. And it was -- it was a document that was signed and it was very good document.
The fact is that he also said he's not going to do testing, and he said that recently, and he said it again to me just a little while ago. He doesn't want to do testing. He's not going to do that. That's a big thing. No rockets, no anything. And I believe, you know, when he tells me that. I will take him at his word.
But we'll see how it all goes. I think we had a very good two days, but I just don't think maybe either of us were ready.
Well, I think maybe more than anything else, the fact that they held it today were I'm working on something that is very, very important for the world, not only our country, for the world, was really inappropriate. The Democrats, the hatred is so incredible, and they couldn't help themselves, and that's the way it is. As far as Cohen is concerned, he's convicted.
He's a liar. He's defrauded at a high level. He's got a lot of problems. And, you know, it was very interesting because he lied so much. I watched some of it. I actually was able to watch some of it. He lied so much, and yet he said, when it came to collusion, the whole hoax with the Russia collusion --
-- just a witch hunt hoax, and very -- by the way, very, very bad for our country, because it really stops you from doing what you're supposed to do.
He said no collusion. And I said, it's funny, he lied about so many things, and yet he could have said -- he might as well lie about that one, too. But he said no collusion. And everybody said no collusion. Richard Burr, Senator Burr said no collusion. Senate Intelligence, the House has come up, as you know, the committee, Devin Nunes and all, they said no collusion.
And yet, it goes on and on and --
Two -- yes, I guess more than that.
It really was -- look, when you think of it, it was really from the time I came down on the escalator with Melania. I came down on the escalator and I think it started just shortly after that. It is a terrible thing, and hopefully, people will get -- because no president should have to have that happened to them.
It's so bad for the country. It's a hoax. It's just a terrible witch hunt. And it shouldn't happen to another president. And yet, I think I've been the most successful --
I think I've been the most successful president in the first two years of office. If you look at the tax cuts and regulation cuts and all of the things that you say so nicely on many of your shows. But you look at what we've done for the vets and what we've done for the military, $716 billion, and all of the things that we've done.
I mean, it's been a tremendous administration. But we always have to -- we have to always fight this hoax that's going on. It's a shame. It's a very sad thing for our country.
Right.
Yes.
No, he did. And he made a decision. And remember this, he's an attorney. Whatever decision he makes, you're supposed to rely on an attorney to make a decision. Somebody said -- one of the very good Republican members today said that -- you know, he's supposed to be an attorney. He's out there doing all sorts of things.
When you're -- when you have an attorney, you're supposed to be able to rely on your attorney.
Well -- but it's also called reliance. He just was not much of an attorney, that I will tell you. But he went up today and a lot of people thought he was very bad. I watched some of it, I thought it was -- I thought it was a terrible display of dishonesty, actually.
Yes, I heard that.
Right.
Based on Senator Burr and Devin Nunes and everybody that's looked at it, including Michael Cohen -- no collusion. And, you know, this was all about collusion with Russia, the collusion delusion. And it's a shame, but it's just one of those things. You live with it, you win it. So, I hope it's going to be an honest report.
If it isn't, we fight it, very strongly, we fight it. Because when you look at what happened at the FBI at the top levels with McCabe, and the dishonesty, Comey and the dishonesty --
That's right. James Baker, he was another one who was dismissed. You look at Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, and you look at what went on with that whole deal with the insurance policy. The insurance policy just in case she loses. I will tell you, it's a very dishonest group of people and it's -- I've done -- I've done a great service for this country by exposing it. When you look at what happened there and at Justice, and they call it Justice, but it hasn't been justice.
When you take a look at what's gone on, I'm very proud of the fact that, you know, we've exposed a lot of people. It's like 12, somebody said much more than that now.
And this is great dishonesty at a very high level. We can't let that happen to our country.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I think we have a great attorney general. I hope and I think he's going to do a terrific job. He's smart, he's tough. He loves the country and he loves the Department of Justice. He loves the Department of Justice and the FBI. And Bill Barr is, I think, going to be exceptional and you need somebody exceptional, because it has to be cleaned out.
What's going on there for years has been terrible. You look at Ohr, and Ohr's wife who worked for GPS Fusion, and they're the ones who did this phony report, the fake dossier -- boy, it's a hornet's nest. And I think -- I think that Bill is going to do a great job.
Oh, we'll be fighting --
Yes.
That's right. We got a lot.
Well, first of all, we're going to be building over 200 miles of wall. I'm going to call it a wall as supposed to barriers or slats. They said, could you call it slats or barriers? We played the game for a little while and then you just say, hey, look, this is -- we need border security. You can't have border security without a wall, and a strong wall.
If you didn't have it in Tijuana, you would have people coming across by the thousands and thousands. And I will say this, whether it's ICE or Border Patrol, or just law enforcement, they have done an incredible job at the border. Apprehensions, the greatest number we've ever done. You look at the number of people.
But if we had a wall, we wouldn't have to apprehend. People wouldn't come into our country. Drugs wouldn't come into our country. The human trafficking is incredible, the number of people brought into our country.
And they don't come through the points of entry. They come through in the middle of the desert where you have open space. So, I think that really, it's a very dangerous thing for people to be voting against border security -- for anybody, including Republicans. I really think that Republicans that vote against border security and the wall, I think, you know, I've been okay at predicting things, I think they put themselves at great jeopardy.
Yes.
Well, it's an incredible thing. I see senators that have been there for a long time, you know, well-known senators, named senators, and I look at them and they're endorsing it, and yet, what are they endorsing? Now that you look at it, you look at it --
Yes. A hundred trillion dollars, and you couldn't do it for that.
But it's -- and it's not even the money. It's so ridiculous. No planes, let's not fly anymore. It is crazy. But personally, they should go for it. I love it.
As long as they're the ones that have to sell it, not me. So, I'm --
I'm really looking forward to seeing what the rest of them are going to do. But already, some have endorsed. It is incredible.
Appreciate it.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-07-09,"Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with the Emir of Qatar -- a highly respected man, a real leader in a large part of the world and a very important part of the world. And we've known each other a long time. We've been friends for a long time. And we're doing a lot of work now. They're investing very heavily in our country.
They're creating a lot of jobs. They're buying tremendous amounts of military equipment, including planes. And they're buying commercial planes, as you know -- very large numbers of commercial planes from Boeing. And we very much appreciate it. We're going to be signing a document today -- a very large transaction.
You're going to be invited to the signing. It's a transaction that will be purchasing a lot of Boeing jets and a lot of money spent in our country, and that means a lot of jobs. So, we just appreciate everything. We have a great operation -- military operation -- right now in Qatar. They built one of the great military bases, I would say, anywhere in the world.
And it's just been expanded, with runways and everything else. It's been really a great honor to work with my friend. Thank you very much for being here.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. And I will say the base is incredible. It's -- what they've done there is absolutely -- and a great place to have it, right in the middle of the Middle East. And so it's -- obviously, it's a very important location. So thank you all very much. Yes.
I don't know anything about it.
Well, we're going to see what happens with Iran. Iran is doing a lot of bad things right now and they better be very careful.
Well, you know, I met Secretary Acosta -- the first time, I know -- when I made the deal to bring him on into the administration. I can tell you that for two and a half years he's been just an excellent Secretary of Labor. He's done a fantastic job. Now, part of it is our economy is so good; our unemployment numbers are at record lows.
You know, so many good things are happening. But the fact is he's been a very good Secretary of Labor. What happened 12 or 15 years ago with respect to when he was a U.S. Attorney, I think in Miami -- is it Miami?
You know, if you go back and look at everybody else's decisions, whether it's a U.S. Attorney or an Assistant U.S. Attorney or a judge -- you go back 12 or 15 years ago or 20 years ago, and look at their past decisions, I would think you'd probably find that they would wish they'd maybe did it a different way.
I do hear that there were a lot of people involved in that decision, not just him. I can only say this: From what I know -- and what I do know is that he's been a great -- really great Secretary of Labor. The rest of it we'll have to look at. We'll have to look at it very carefully. But you're talking about a long time ago.
And again, it was a decision made, I think, not by him but by a lot of people. So we're going to look at it very carefully. We'll be looking at that very carefully. Okay? Okay. Anything else?
Well, I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him. I mean, people in Palm Beach knew him. He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years. I wasn't a fan.
I was not -- yeah, a long time ago. I'd say maybe 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you. I was not a fan of his. So I feel very badly, actually, for Secretary Acosta because I've known him as being somebody that works so hard and has done such a good job. I feel very badly about that whole situation.
But we're going to be looking at that and looking at it very closely. We're also going to be signing a big contract in a little while, so we're going to see you in a little while in a different room, in a different part of the White House where we're going to be signing up a big deal with Boeing. Thank you very much. We'll see you in a couple of minutes.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-06-18,"Hello everyone.
I want to start by congratulating all of the new, non-permanent members of the UN Security Council. And although Canada isn’t one of them, I want to take a moment to talk about our work on the file.
As Canadians know, we embarked on this journey four years ago now.
We decided to throw our hat in the ring because we saw a unique opportunity to engage with our partners across the UN, build sustainable peace, and make real progress on issues that matter to Canadians.
And that’s what we’ve done during this campaign.
We forged new partnerships, we strengthened existing friendships, and we laid a solid foundation for an even greater collaboration in the future.
And that’s never been more critical.
Now more than ever, global cooperation is crucial not only to defeat this virus, but to address the great challenges of our time – challenges that transcend borders.
Growing our economies, mitigating the impacts of climate change, building a lasting peace, advancing gender equality, protecting our citizens – we have to engage with partners to achieve these goals.
Getting this seat was never an end in itself, but rather a means to an end. A means to ensure that our voice was heard and that our values were upheld on the world stage.
The bid was certainly one way to achieve this, but it’s far from the only way.
Moving forward, Canadians can count on us to keep working with our partners to make progress internationally on issues that matter to them.
Across the country, we’re starting to reopen parts of the economy and that’s welcome news for everyone.
But as we start loosening some restrictions, we also have to strengthen other measures so that we don’t lose the progress we’ve made.
As some people start heading back to work, testing and contact tracing is crucial.
That’s why we’ve been working with the provinces and territories to ensure that they have everything they need to keep people safe and healthy.
And today, we’re taking an important step forward toward containing the virus and safely restarting the economy.
Led by the Canadian Digital Service, and with the help of Shopify, Blackberry, and the Government of Ontario, we’ve been working on a nationwide mobile app that will notify users if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19.
We will soon begin testing this app in Ontario. There are already a number of other provinces, including B.C., who are working with us on this, but it will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.
Premier Ford will have more to say on how the app will work in Ontario later today, but I want to thank him and his government for their leadership and partnership.
Now, I want to stress that this app will be completely voluntary.
It’ll be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not.
But the app will be most effective when as many people as possible have it.
Here’s how it’s going to work.
If you test positive for COVID-19, a health-care professional will help you upload your status anonymously to a national network.
Other users who have the app and have been in proximity to you will then be alerted that they’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive.
The notification will encourage them to reach out to their local public health authorities.
At no time will personal information be collected or shared, and no location services will be used.
The privacy of Canadians will be fully respected.
Over the past few weeks, we have started reopening some parts of the economy.
But this presents specific challenges for different sectors.
I am thinking, for example, of the cultural industry.
Since the beginning of the crisis, our government has been there for artists, creators, and workers in this sector.
The Canada Council for the Arts estimates that, in total, the cultural industry has received over $2.5 billion, notably through programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
In April, we provided $500 million to support our artists, our creators, and our rising sports stars. I can announce that we are today launching an online portal to speed up the processing of these applications.
Organizations that want to obtain funding can now apply on the government’s site.
We are making significant progress, but we know there is still work to be done.
Over the past few months, our museums have experienced major revenue losses, which is threatening a lot of people’s jobs.
Our government has therefore decided to invest an additional $25.7 million to maintain nearly 200 jobs in seven national museums across the country.
Our museums tell our stories, celebrate our artists, and enrich our communities.
The people working in these institutions are preserving our Canadian heritage.
They help us to learn about our past and to discover those who have left their mark on our country.
Since the beginning of the crisis, our government has been closely monitoring the spread of the virus, its impacts on our economy, and making the right adjustments along the way.
We’re going to keep listening to Canadians and look for other ways to support them as the situation evolves.

But it's working very well either way. But I just want to thank Gianni Infantino for being here. He's the president of FIFA and a highly respected man. In fact, when my son heard he was going to be here, he said, ""Dad, I'd like to meet him."" So you're pretty famous, right? Pretty important and pretty famous.
He likes -- my son, Barron, loves soccer. And soccer has to be one of the fastest-growing sports in the world. And the job you've done is really fantastic, Gianni. So thank you very much.
And I want to also pay my respect to Carlos Cordeiro, who -- as president, in this country, of soccer -- has been incredibly instrumental in helping us to get the World Cup. And he's worked so hard, so long. And they were calling me constantly to try to get me to come onboard, but it only took one call because when I heard ""World Cup,"" I wanted to do it.
And again, we want to thank you. It's all signed up. It's all set to go. And it'll be a special event. I think it's going to be something, really, very special. And, Gianni, maybe I'd ask you to say a few words, and then Carlos.
Right. Right.
Right.
Right, okay. Well, we'll do it.
It's very exciting. Everybody is talking about it, and it's very exciting. And Carlos.
Well, thank you, Carlos. And I have to also thank Bob Kraft, who I know that you were working very hard with. Bob originally called me and he said, ""What do you think of the idea of trying to get the World Cup to the United States?"" And I said, ""I think we really like it."" And then we got Canada, we got Mexico involved, and we're going to have a great partnership. And it's going to be very special. I look forward to it.
So let's see, 2026 -- I won't be here. I won't be here.
-- the media is going to be very boring. It's going to be very boring. They'll all be out of business, I guess. But we will -- we will be there and it will be a very, very important and a very special event. And I think, also, having it in the United States is very important for soccer.
Especially in light of the fact that soccer has done so well.
Thank you, my friend. I appreciate it very much.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Sure. I'd love that. Thank you.
What -- excuse me. Excuse me.
Can you just hold it. Where are you from?
Okay.
Except it had a little problem last time.
Okay.
Let me stand up, Gianni.
That's good. That's good. Great. Thank you very much. That's very nice.
Yes. Wow, look at that.
That's pretty good. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. That's really very nice.
Right.
That's true. That's true. Right? That's very good.
I like that.
I like that.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Carlos. Congratulations. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
Yeah. The wall will be paid for very easily by Mexico. It will ultimately be paid for by Mexico.
Yeah, I think Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people. And I think that's a very serious thing, and it's a very serious charge. I think what Google and what others are doing -- if you look at what's going on at Twitter, if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful, because you can't do that to people. You can't do it.
We have tremendous -- we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can't do that. And so I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook, they're really treading on very, very troubled territory. And they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions of the population. Okay. Thank you very much everybody.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Meets with the President of FIFA,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-fifa-meeting-august-28-2018
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-11-04,"Thank you very much. Thank you, folks.
You know, this is where it all began, New Hampshire. This is where it all began.
First victory. This was our first victory and I've never forgotten it. And I made a promise to you. We're going to keep the poison out. You know what that is, the drugs. We're gonna stop those drugs.
Right -- right here is where I learned more about it than in any place else and we are gonna stop the poison from coming into this country.
You watch. You watch.
In four days, we are going to win the great state of New Hampshire...
... and we are going to win back the White House.
And we've had incredible polls. You've probably seen the new Rasmussen poll just came out, we're three points up nationwide and going like a rocket.
Many, many polls. I won't even go over all the polls, but we're leading in Ohio, and Iowa, all over the place.
I think we're doing great in North Carolina. I think we're doing great in Pennsylvania too, by the way. And Florida looks beautiful. Florida looks beautiful. We have so many great polls.
But you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You have to do that. We're on the cusp of historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to you, the American people. That's what's gonna happen.
That's what's gonna happen.
There's more breaking news, as you probably heard, that I'd like to share with you right now. Is that OK.
As you know, the FBI now has multiple open criminal investigations into Hillary Clinton.
This includes the discovery of another 650,000 e-mails and also a far-reaching criminal investigation into her pay for play scheme at the State Department. Last night, CBS News just confirmed that the 650,000 e-mails include brand new e-mails not previously seen by authorities.
She said she gave them all in, right? She said, gave them all in. Well, when we saw 650,000, we figured, I guess there has to become surprises. Wait till you see what they find in those 650 too, it won't be pretty.
Hillary Clinton lied to Congress under oath when she said she turned over all her work-related e-mails, and that she didn't send classified information on her illegal server. Meaning, she may now face major problems for perjury.
How can Hillary manage this country, when she can't even manage her e-mails? Did you ever see -- hey, folks, let's forget all of the stuff -- what a mess -- what a mess. All she had to do was follow the rules and assume people are watching or listening, who cares right? What a mess, and for what? Now we're going to have her running the country for four years.
What a -- honestly, what a terrible, terrible mess. Over -- over what? Over nothing, over what should have been nothing. All she had to do was follow the rules, unbelievable. And now she is going to run the country. She will be under investigation for years, she will be with trials. Our country, we have to get back to work, right?
Well, one of her top people, I guess her top person said -- WikiLeaks, said she has bad instincts, what a bad thing, bad instincts. She should fire him, honestly. That would be good instincts, but she should fire him, John Podesta. In an e-mail said, Hillary has bad instincts. Do you want that for your president? Then Bernie Sanders said -- Bernie Sanders said bad judgment, but in all fairness he was running against her. So he said bad judgment.
But the guy that's running her campaign says Hillary really has bad instincts. Then we're going to say, let's make her president. The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment, however the report also shows that the political leadership at the Department of Justice is trying as hard as it can to protect their angel, Hillary Clinton. Why didn't they protect General Cartwright, and why didn't they protect General Petraeus? Why didn't they protect a kid who's taking a couple pictures of a submarine -- that's an old submarine? And they put him in jail -- they put him in jail -- lovely family, lovely mother, they put him in jail because he wanted to have some remembrance of where he worked. It's an old submarine, believe me, they have pictures of that submarine that nobody knows about, probably, right? They put him in jail.
And you see what she does and she's allowed to run for president. Folks do you know what it tells you? The system is rigged, and I've been saying that for a long time.
The system is rigged, she shouldn't be allowed to run. Hillary is engaged in massive criminal enterprise and cover-up. She created an illegal e-mail server to shield her criminal activity and corrupt pay for play. She illegally transmitted confidential information -- you're just not allowed to do that. Forget about the second go round, what she's in now. The first go around, you're not allowed to do it, you're not allowed to delete after you get subpoena.
She illegally destroyed federal records, including 33,000 e- mails, which she deleted after getting that subpoena from Congress. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis, what a mess. I mean, we went through it with him, with the impeachment and the lies, aren't we tired of this stuff?
She is likely to be under investigation for a long time, concluding in a criminal trial, our president. America deserves a government that can go to work on day one and get it done.
Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare.
And Obama, you know, he is campaigning all over the place. I left Miami yesterday, there was the plane. He is campaigning -- he ought to be in the White House working and getting our jobs back, and building up our military, and creating some semblance of a border -- which we don't have now.
It's just been announced that Americans nationwide are going to experience a massive, double digit premium hike in Obamacare. In the great state of Arizona -- where I just left, and I'll be back -- premiums are going up more than 116 percent, Arizona, 116 percent. Over 90 percent of the counties in New Hampshire are losing Obamacare, they're losing the insurers, and that's going to be next year. So lot's of luck negotiating, folks, 90 percent. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof. Other than that, it's a fantastic health care, fantastic.
It's really fabulous, isn't it? It was bad before they even did it. You have to say, I'm pretty consistent -- I called a lot of things over the years, right? But I said Obamacare's not going to work before it was even approved and he got it approved -- he got it approved by lies because he said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan and even Democrats that didn't want it, they said all right, well then. And he got people -- they wish they didn't approve it now, believe me. It is a catastrophe.
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive than it already is and it doesn't work. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in New Hampshire and every family in this country.
Real change also means restoring honesty to government. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption, which there's plenty.
First thing we have to do is keep Hillary Clinton out of office.
That will be a good start. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words, we -- all of us together -- are about to say. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs, about time. The terrible jobs report that just came out shows the number of people not in the workforce increased by another 425,000 people last month. That's why you see these phony numbers about five percent unemployed. People are stopping, they're not looking for work anymore because they can't get a job, then they take them off the rolls.
These numbers are an absolute disaster. Labor force participation has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 40 years, that's what's happening. Nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working. They want to work, they're not working. After eight years, Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of three percent growth. We're growing at any average of probably one to two percent, nobody even knows and nobody believes the numbers anyway. The numbers they put out are phony as far as I'm concerned.
For millions of Americans, it's an economic nightmare. New Hampshire has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.
This is the one that's hardest to believe of all. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. You people know -- New England, boy do you know it. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, and that's what it is when you think. We have a one way highway right into Mexico and these other places. They take our jobs and they take our money, they take out cash. You know what we get out of it? Drugs and unemployment. It's going to end, don't worry about it, folks. Don't even think about it. It's going to end.
Don't forget -- and I have to say this, because I tell this story all over the place. I learn so much in New Hampshire because I see this place, it's so beautiful. To me, it's one of the most beautiful places on Earth. You -- nice, beautiful winding roads -- even the roads, everything's so -- the trees and the little lakes and streams. And I sat down because I have so many friends up here, because I worked hard during those primaries.
Remember, I was supposed to lose the primary. I won in a landslide, right.
Remember they had the story the day before. It looks like Trump could lose New Hampshire. And the numbers came out, it was a land slide. But what I learned is -- because it was so -- it was sort of shocking because I considered -- you know, I love this kind of look. And I consider with the trees and the whole thing -- so beautiful. And I sat down with groups of people. You know, it wasn't always big rallies because I'd sit down with people.
Say, What's the problem?"" Every single group said heroin. I said
And then I met with your police. You have the great -- you have such great law enforcement up here. But they said the same thing.
And so much of their crime is caused by drugs. They come from the southern border largely. And I said to you -- I said to you and you remember this, if I make it, we are going to stop that problem and then we're gonna work on all of the people who are so seriously addicted. And there are things happening -- you know, there are things happening with medicines that the federal FDA is not even releasing. They're not even releasing. There are things that come out that potentially could really help.
But we're gonna work on the people that have become so seriously addicted because it's tremendous. It's not only our youth. You know, I say poisoning our youth, but it's a lot of other people. But I learned that from New Hampshire. Then I go to other states and they say very similar things. But honestly never as much fervor as drugs in New Hampshire, and it just really had a great impact.
I said to you I'm gonna solve the problem if I get there. And boy, are we are getting close. Now we're getting close, right.
True. We're gonna solve it. When you see the rusted out factories and empty buildings, just remember this. Hillary Clinton's policies and others like her, her friends, did this to us, all of us. Just look at the devastation. Rockwell laid-off 169 people in Manchester and moved their jobs to Mexico. Fisher -- and these are recent. Fisher Scientific laid-off 213 people in Hudson and moved their jobs to Mexico. The woman -- I just overheard her say, I didn't know that."" Right? Now you know. Now you know. She was a little louder than she thought. That's OK. We're gonna solve it. When you see the rusted out factories and empty buildings
She didn't know. Now she knows. Car Component Technologies laid-off 559 workers in Bedford and moved their jobs to Canada and to Mexico. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, believe me, and we will stop the jobs from leaving New Hampshire.
The theft of American prosperity will end. They have taken away our prosperity. From now on, it's going to be America first.
There'll be consequences. There will be consequences. If a company wants to fire their workers, leave New Hampshire, move another -- you know, to another country, wonderful. Enjoy yourself, right? And then ship their products back into the United States, they will pay a 35 percent tax, OK.
And let me just tell you a little -- right now, they move, they build, they have lots of fun and they just send it right through a very weak border. First of all, they're gonna have to send through a very strong border, but that's OK. But they're gonna have a 35 percent tax.
Here's what's going to happen: they're not gonna move because it doesn't work anymore. They're not gonna move. They're gonna stay in this country. They're gonna stay in New Hampshire. They're gonna stay in this country. It's so simple. But the politicians will never approve that because the special interests and their donors want them to be able to go and -- you know, it's good for them, but it's not good for us.
A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers. We have to have jobs...
You know, I -- I said before, it's a one -- it's a one-lane highway. We have to have a lane coming in our direction too, folks. We have nothing. We get nothing.
We will also immediately stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's gonna be the next disaster.
That's another beauty. That'll take the jobs you have left.
As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent and we'll keep our business.
We're right now the highest taxed nation in the world. And remember, Hillary wants to raise taxes, big league. We will massive cut taxes for the middle class. She wants to raise them big league. Doesn't even make sense. We will also -- that's right; $1.3 billion -- $1.6 billion.
Trillion. You're right. Nobody can even believe it. One point -- go ahead.
That's right. He read the -- he read her page. And if she says that, it's going higher. You know that. $1.3 trillion. Can you -- it's inconceivable. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Remember that.
We will also cancel -- we're gonna save ourselves altogether, OK.
He says, Save us."" We're gonna all save ourselves.""""e says
They don't even question. And now, we're gonna -- we're gonna -- we're gonna be so strong again and so smart again. We're gonna be -- you don't have to worry about saving. It's gonna be well beyond saving, OK?
We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations, money that we don't even know what they do with it.
We don't even know what they do with it. And use that money to support America's environmental infrastructure. For instance, up here. What we want. We want crystal clear, clean water. Right? Everybody. We want beautiful -- right? We want beautiful air to breath. We want safety. Other than that, that's all we want.
The rest we want are companies to go out and compete with oil. They can't compete because of all of these restrictions. But we want clear water, clean air, and we want safety. That's to me, what I like. And that's to me -- and I've won many environmental awards by the way. I'm -- I've actually been called an environmentalist, if you can believe that.
That includes protecting the great bay and the white mountains of New Hampshire. We're gonna protect them -- they'll be protected. They'll be better protected than they are right now with a lot less intrusive nonsense.
Our plan will end excessive federal regulations that are harming fisherman on the sea coast, you know all about that. They're making it impossible. They're making it for the miners, for the fishermen. They're making it impossible for the steel workers with all the dumping of steel all over the place. We will become a rich nation again -- a truly rich nation. Some people think that doesn't sound nice -- it's not politically correct. We have to.
But to be a rich nation, we much also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country.
That's over and above the thousands and thousands being let in right now by Obama. Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism spreading into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program.
And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Sorry.
Had no choice, we have no choice. And we all have a heart and will build safe zones in Syria, we'll help them. We all have a heart. But we see what's happening to Germany and to France and to all of these -- it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Look at Nice this summer. Look at what's going on in Paris and all of these -- all of these different places.
We're gonna work, but we're -- you know, we owe $20 trillion. We're not gonna spend the money. I'll get the Gulf states to put up the money. They have tremendous money. They need us, they have to step up to the plate. They need us, we'll get them to put up the money, we'll lead the effort, and we'll build safe zones all over Syria. And we'll take care of it.
We'll get other people to pay. We'll get other people to pay.
Who said that? Who?
That statement could only be made in New Hampshire, I have to tell you. You people, if the press hears that statement, you'll be in trouble. But somehow I think he'll be able to handle it.
A Trump administration will also secure, defend the borders of the United States.
And yes, we will build a great wall.
We received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers. We will work with them -- these are great people but the way, would've been a lot easier if they didn't -- look, if Hillary got in, all they'd have to do is stand there and let people walk right in front of them.
These are great people. They know what is happening to our country. They see what's happening to our country. We will work with them to stop the drugs from pouring into New Hampshire and throughout the country and poisoning our youth. The immigration officers warned in a letter that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history, and that will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, it's a quote from them.
As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allows many, many people -- she allowed so many people, the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free, because their home countries -- very intelligently -- wouldn't take them back. We get these people that weren't supposed to be here, that are violent criminals, drug dealers, gang members, heads of gangs. We put them in a plane, we send them back, their countries say, we don't want them. We don't want them. We're not taking them. They'd call the secretary of State -- or her, or her people -- they won't take them back. That's OK, bring them back, let them out, and then they kill people. OK or they do other things that are very bad.
Ever, never, never happen. They don't respect us, these other countries don't have respect. Hillary supports totally open borders, there goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant, deported at least five times. A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities.
We will end illegal immigration, stop the drugs from pouring into our country, deport all criminal aliens and save so many American lives.
We will also reap -- and it's just safe -- it's just -- doesn't that make sense?
We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester. And rebuild our badly depleted military.
Greatest people on Earth -- the greatest people. Our Navy is the smallest it's been. Listen to this, how sad, and then you see China in the South China Sea, building their fortresses and taking our money. They take our money and they build their fortresses, we'll have a great relationship, I have a great relationship with China, I've made a lot of money dealing with China, China's terrific.
Look, dealing with China is great, but I'm -- and I'm not angry China for doing this stuff. I'm angry at our people for allowing it to happen. Our Navy is the smallest it has been since World War I, you believe that? We will build the 350 ship Navy that our country needs, and really is requesting, which means lots more work for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
Right? Great shipyard, not too busy, but it's a great shipyard. We'll make it busy. And you know, things like that -- number one, we're building our defense, it also puts our great people to work, right? It's great. We'll also expand the center of excellence at Portsmouth to recruit a large number of skilled craftsmen like pipefitters and welders that we need to expand our fleet. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. I was with them last night.
Near Fort Bragg -- we were right near Fort Bragg last night. We had some amazing people, we had over 20,000 people. It was the most unbelievable evening and we had tremendous numbers of admirals and generals and we had a lot of Medal of Honor winners, amazing, it was an amazing evening. Our new foreign policy will put America first. You haven't heard that for a long time. Hillary brought death and disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya, she empowered Iran and, she unleashed ISIS.
Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict -- and this in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could seriously lead to World War III. I think she's an unstable person to start off with, I really do.
I think she's unstable.
She and Obama created it through the vacuum. Hillary...
Wars that never end, wars that we never win. And now it's in worse shape than it's ever been before and we have to rebuild our country, folks. We could have rebuilt our country twice and the Middle East now is far worse than it was when we started this whole mess. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and they've left our borders wide open at home. Isn't it interesting how we fight for other people's borders, lose our lives -- the lives, the money -- most important are the lives, the great lives. We lose lives, the money, and yet we want to have open borders, right? Explain that. We fight for borders for other countries -- half the people never heard of these other countries. They want borders and then we leave our borders open. And they've shipped our jobs and they've shipped our wealth to other countries. To all Americans, I say it is time for new leadership.
We need change. We need change. The last thing we need is four more years of Obama with ISIS...
That's really nice.
I think we're going to have a great, great day on Tuesday in New Hampshire.
You know, one of the big commentators, political commentators -- I thought I'd tell you, it's only good for your ego -- but just said whoever wins New Hampshire is going to win.
It's interesting, right? She said, You'll win by five."" Only five? I want more than five. Let's win.
Justin concluded. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration.
We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe beyond. And Hillary wants to raise your taxes. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, killing businesses. We will cancel every illegal Obama executive order.
We are going to protect religious liberty.
Rebuild our military and take care of our great, great vets. We're going to take care of our vets.
And I mean really take care of them, not like all the lip service they've had for 25 years. Our vets -- by the way folks, are treated so poorly, the stories are horrible. Stories -- great -- that's great.
Hold that up with pride. We love you, man, we love you. That is beautiful. Thank you.
We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to provide school choice and put an end to common core.
We're going to have education local. We will support the great men and women of law enforcement.
Something which you folks like a lot, we will save -- we will save our very much under siege Second Amendment.
And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, who will -- right? Who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
It's time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. We -- you -- you -- we, are the movement of the future.
Common sense, intelligence. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We're asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and Independents and first time voters -- of which there are plenty. You just have to look at the lines in Florida, North Carolina and all over the place. You look at what's happening, tremendous numbers of people that haven't voted in 20 years or first time voters. We're fighting -- like him, he just said like him -- well, thank you, man. He just said, I voted."""",32:15.0,32:49.0,34,32bakurO9_l9w,121,Donald Trump,Is that your first time? That's beautiful
Lot of people, lot of people. I mean you have people, literally -- and they show the lines in Florida and Texas. Remember they said, Texas is in play -- two weeks ago I said, really? I thought I was doing great in Texas. These people, they're horrible people.
Texas -- they go, Texas is in play and then they have the lines they're a mile long. And then you have this wonderful guy, Mr. Miller -- Sid Miller, gets on one of the shows, how are you doing in Texas? He says this is a total blowout for Trump, now they're saying it's in play. So, these lines are a mile long, we never had lines like this. And people that have never voted before are coming onto the lines wearing Trump shirts and hats and buttons falling off that. These are people that never voted. These are people that didn't give a damn for politics because they never saw anybody that they liked.
They love the country as much as anybody, but they never -- like you -- but they never saw anybody that they felt good about and they didn't vote. And now they go from that, they go from being a non- political person into wearing Trump shirts and buttons. It's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.
But Texas is a total blowout. But you remember, right? Texas is in play. These characters. They're just bad people, the media. They are bad people. Bad people.
And then one of them said this morning, We were wrong about Texas."" A total blowout. We're going to have a lot of blowouts
I'll never forget it, folks. I'm telling you, four, five days ago, before the lines formed, Texas is in play."" I said man
We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests.
We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family and hope and pray and yearn for a better future. I'm asking you to dream big, because with your vote, we are just -- can you believe this -- four days away. Four days away.
We're four days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. I'm ready. I'm ready.
I'm ready. He just -- a vet. He's a great veteran. He's just shouting, Are you ready?"" I'm ready. I promise. He just -- a vet. He's a great veteran""
I didn't need this, folks. I -- I was -- hey look, I was on the other side. I understood the other side very well. It was very nice, very enjoyable. But I love this country and we had to do this. Believe me, we had to do this. And I'm ready.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you very much.
Together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again.
God bless you, everybody.
God bless you. Thank you very much. Thank you, New Hampshire. Get out and vote.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Atkinson, NH",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-atkinson-nh-november-4-2016
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-03-13,"Thank you. I am really thrilled to be here at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, home of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing and the mighty Miramar Marines. Thank you very much. This is beautiful. OK? And thank you for being here, Darrell.
Colonel, I want to just thank you and Colonel Woodworth, I salute you both. You are really tremendous. The job you've done. You lead the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing and the Miramar Marines with the excellence and honor for which this corps is admired. All throughout the world, they talk about you.
I want to thank all of the incredible soldiers, sailors, Airmen and Coast Guardsmen who traveled here today from the stations all across the San Diego region. I have a message for you straight from the heart of the American people. And you know what that is. We support you, we thank you, we love you, and we will always have your back like you have ours. Thank you.
And very importantly, most important. To all of the military spouses and family members here today, we know that you really serve too. Many cases, you're the real boss in the family, right? We know that. So thank you. None of this would be possible without your incredible sacrifice and the tireless support that you give. So thank you all..
And finally, to the thousands of Marines here today, from Miramar..... and Camp Pendleton. I want you to know how proud we are of everything we do. And, you know, we have General Kelly here, four star. And he's doing a great job in Washington. He misses you.
Your devotion fills our allies and our families with confidence. Your courage fills our enemies with dread.
All of you know the truth of the famous saying, ""Once a Marine
But I'm with you all the time. Today we're the -- with those Marines, I'll tell you. I gave a speech recently at the Coast Guard Academy. It was so great. And between Annapolis and West Point, Air Force Academy, we've done them all and we're doing them. So we'll see you guys very soon.
But today, I hate to say it. Congratulations. And I'm proud to say that we have several really tough Marines serving in our administration. So not only John Kelly, but defense secretary -- now, did anyone ever hear of Mad Dog Mattis? No. Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General ""Fighting Joe"""" Dunford
And our new director of the Secret Service and veteran of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, General Tex -- you know General? You know him? Tex A., I call him. Big General ""Tex"""" A.
Our administration is stacked with Marines because Marines are the kind of people you want at your side. And trust me, you don't ever want to be on the other side of a fighting marine. It's trouble. It's painful.
The Marines are the first into battle and the first to fight. Marines never give up, never give in, never retreat and never, ever surrender. You are faithful to each other, faithful to your mission and you are always faithful to the country that you love, the USA.
And as your commander in chief, just like every president before me, I have no greater comfort than knowing I can have absolute faith in you. In 1918, when foreign military aggression threatened our way of life, we called on the Marines.
Marine Sergeant Dan Daly urged his men through the horrible trenches with the courageous battle cry that you all know very well, do you want to live forever? That was the question and that was the cry.
In 1945, when we needed someone who scale the cliffs and to plant the flag at a rugged mountain peak, in Iwo Jima, we called on the Marines. In 1950, when setbacks loomed in Korea, although we're doing a pretty good job with Korea right now.
And hopefully something positive will come out of it. Hopefully something very positives going to come out of it. We'll see. And we're prepared for anything, right? We always have to be prepared for anything. But I really believe something very positive could happen. Great for Korea, North and South, and great for the world and great for this country.
So when it loomed in Korea and when we needed warriors who would fight against all odds, and the chosen reservoir, we called on the Marines, the legendary men of the frozen chosen. In 1962, when America needed a man to border rocket launch into space and orbit the earth for the first time, we called on a Marine, the one and only John Glen.
The legendary axe like these who have sacrificed courage of heroism  are the proud legacy of the United States Marines, can be very proud. Your heritage drives you, your heroes inspire you and your actions immortalize you in the pages of American history, incredible history. And every day you push yourselves to new heights of excellence and new depths of courage, keeping America safe, America strong, and America free.
You honor your duty to your country. Now we must honor our duty to you. For too long the men and women of the United States Armed Forces have been asked to do more with less. You've borne  the costs of underinvestment and deferred modernization and, also, deferred maintenance. You've endured longer and more frequent deployments.
You've spent countless hours fixing and maintaining old equipment. You have fewer ships than we should, fewer planes than we should and you have fewer of you than we should. Today, I am very pleased to report that all of that is changing and all of that as you have seen is changing quickly.
The Trump administration is committed to a policy of peace through strength. We have finally ended the devastating defense sequester that you've lived with for many years. We are now undertaking the largest military buildup since Ronald Reagan and one of the largest buildups we've ever had in the history of our nation.
Last year, I requested and received an additional $21 billion to address urgent readiness shortfalls. The two-year budget agreement I just reached with Congress will provide $700 billion in defense funding this year, the largest ever, larger by far than any country has ever spent. And next year we will raise that number to $716 billion. That's a lot of money, even for you, that's a lot of money.
We're also investing in our greatest weapon of all, our most powerful weapon, our most beautiful weapon, our most brilliant weapon; you. In 2019, we want to give you your largest pay raise in over a decade. You deserve it. You deserve it.
And we are building new F-35 joint strike fighters and we are going to send them right here to Miramar, along with lots of other fighters and lots of other weaponry; weaponry like we've never had before or sent before. They'll be sent also all over the world.
And I understand some of you really great pilots could use some new CH-53s. Is that a correct statement? You want to see some new ones, huh. Well, you're getting them, okay, brand new, right off the line. We are getting a lot of great stuff.
I'm happy to report that in the near future Miramar is getting brand new CH-53K King Stallions; the big ones you are getting. They'll be sent soon. They are coming. They are being made.
We are also modernizing our nuclear capabilities and rebuilding our nuclear infrastructure. We're investing more money than we have ever done before, because we have to be so far ahead of any other country. It's a capability we never even want to think about using, but we have to be prepared. And in a nuclear front, we are so far, and will be so far ahead of any other country. We have no choice.
We have increased investment in hypersonic weapon systems by 50 percent and we're accelerating development of hypersonic systems that can fly five times the speed of sound. That's pretty quick.
In space, the United States is going to do Colonel Glenn proud. We are finally going to lead again. You see what's happening? You see the rockets going up left and right? You haven't seen that for a long time.
Very soon we are going to Mars. You wouldn't have been going to Mars if my opponent won, that I can tell you. You wouldn't even be thinking about it. Wouldn't be thinking about it.
My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air, and sea. We may even have a Space Force -- develop another one; Space Force. We have the Air Force; we'll have the Space Force. We have the Army, the Navy.
You know, I was saying it the other day, because we are doing a tremendous amount of work in space. I said maybe we need a new force. We'll call it Space Force. And I was not really serious. Then I said what a great idea. Maybe we'll have to do that. That could happen. That could be the big breaking story. Look at all those people back there. Look at them. Oh, that fake news. They understand.
So think of that, space force, because we're spending a lot and we have a lot of private money coming in. Tremendous, you saw what happened the other day, and tremendous success.
From the very beginning many of our astronauts have been soldiers and sailors, airmen, Coast Guardsmen, and Marines. And our service members will be vital to ensuring America continues to lead the way into the stars. We're going to lead the way in space. We're way, way behind, and we're catching up fast -- so fast that nobody even believes it.
I also have released a new National Security Strategy that underscores the vital importance of homeland security. It's all about homeland security, right. It's about time, right?
Nobody's going to mess with us. Dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations relentlessly seek to exploit our immigration system. I've just come from a trip to the border, where I met with our wonderful border agents -- Border Patrol and the ICE agents -- unbelievable people -- and reviewed prototypes of a new physical wall that will protect our border and protect our country.
We don't have a choice. We need it. We need it for the drugs. We need it for the gangs. We need it for lots of reasons. We have to have it.
It'll be 99.5 percent successful. People won't be able to come over it. The drugs will stop by a lot -- although we have to get a lot tougher with drug dealers. Have to.
But that wall will stop so much. And we looked at the different prototypes, and it was fascinating. And we have two or three that really work. We had people trying to scale -- we've done them every way. You know I'm a builder. What I do best is build, OK.
You know other people, they build a wall and then say, you know, it doesn't work. Well, wait a minute, we just built 1,000 miles of wall. Well, we made a mistake; it doesn't work. We should have done it a different way. We're doing it before we build. Better idea, right? Do you think? Little better.
We're going to have a great wall. It's going to be very effective. It's going to stop people from -- you're not going to see them climbing over this wall too easily. That I can tell you.
I've also called in Congress to close dangerous loopholes that are exploited by traffickers, smugglers and cartels. Human trafficking in this modern age is worse throughout world than it's ever been. Who would think that? In this modern -- human trafficking is worse than it's ever been. Each of you has sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
Our task in government is to ensure that we preserve what we have gained through incredible sacrifice -- of you and many people before you.
That is why my administration is confronting sanctuary city policies that nullify federal law, violate our Constitution, and threaten the safety and security of our nation. They shield criminals. We can't do that.
And that is why we are asking Congress to ensure that no federal funds subsidize this dangerous and unlawful behavior. We want to protect you, and we want to protect all of our families. We want to protect our nation.
We're also taking action to protect our homeland from rogue actors overseas through enhanced missile defense. We're spending a tremendous amount on missile defense, and that's money well spent. And it's also jobs. We make them here. We make them right here. It's also jobs.
We're adding new interceptors, improving sensors, and advancing radar capabilities by many, many times. I have empowered our commanders in Afghanistan with the authorities they need to win, enabling the full might of the American military.
The coalition to defeat ISIS has now liberated almost 100 percent of the territory previously held by these terrorists in Syria and Iraq. We did a great job -- you did a great job. You did a great job.
They would have been around for a long time and they'd be getting bigger and stronger. And, you saw it. And we knocked the hell out of them, we knocked them.
I want to say a special thanks to all of the men and women from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Miramar Air Station and stations across the San Diego region, especially the two Miramar-based squadrons who have just returned from deployment, the Death Rattlers and the Greyhawks. Where are you? Right? Good.
That's a good looking group. That's great. Thank you, great job. Your service has been extraordinary. We won't let up until ISIS is completely destroyed. ISIS never thought this would happen. They never got hit like this. We took off the gloves. In one year, we did more damage to ISIS than other administration, a certain other administration, did in many ways.
We took off the gloves. We're also working with allies and partners to block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon, and confront its sponsorship of terror and bloodshed all around the world. Everywhere we go in the Middle East it's Iran, Iran, Iran, behind every problem is Iran. Well, we're dealing with it in a very serious fashion. One of the worst deals I've ever seen was the Iran deal. $150 billion we gave them, for what?
With your skill and your bravery, I know that the United States military will forever remain the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And we're making it now, with $700 billion and $716 billion the following year. We're giving you the tools that they were trying to take away from you, so important. And the Marines, as always, will be the tip of the spear.
So to the fighting men and women of Miramar and all across the San Diego area, we must all think bigger, build faster, push farther, dare higher and be greater than ever, ever, ever before. Each one of you is vital to our mission.
You're fighter pilots, helo pilots, mechanics, engineers, hospital corpsman, sailors and sergeants, but above all you are great American patriots, just great American patriots. You race into battle, rush into fire, fly into danger and you give all to defend our nation, our people and the American way of life. And they love you.
A century ago, every main who heeded Sergeant Daly's battle cry was pushed on to victory and to glory by that same love of country. As war engulfed Iwo Jima, our young heroes set their eyes upon the same beautiful sight; red, while, and blue perched atop an incredible rocky peak. And when Colonel Glenn looked down on the United States as he soared beyond the limits of our atmosphere, he was filled with the same pride of one beating American heart.
Our pride makes us strong, our strength keeps us free. And because of heroes like you, our freedom will never die. We are becoming stronger, and stronger, and stronger as a nation.
And, while a lot of you don't think about it, our economy is setting records. Our unemployment is at all-time lows. African American unemployment is the lowest it's been in history. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's been in history. Women unemployment is the lowest it's been in 18 years. And we're setting records.
And last week, we had over 150 million people working. That's more people working in our country than ever before in its history. We are making a lot of progress for you.
Today and every day, we pledge to remain always faithful. It is an honor to be with you. You are very, very special people. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Delivers Remarks at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-marine-miramar-california-march-13-2018
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-10-20,"Good morning, everyone.
I’m happy to be here with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and Minister Ng, as well as Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo.
Canada has now passed a total of 200,000 cases of COVID-19 since the spring, with almost 22,000 active cases across the country today.
Here, and around the world, the fight against this virus is far from over.
And in order to win it, we have to keep working together.
Canada is a big country, and the pandemic is playing out differently in different provinces and territories.
That’s why I’m asking everyone to keep following the guidelines of their local public health authorities.
This is a Team Canada effort – and when you wear a mask, limit your in-person close contacts, and use the free COVID Alert app – you’re doing your part. 
As a government, we’re doing ours, too.
Since March, we’ve received almost 800 million pieces of personal protective equipment – masks, gloves, gowns, and face shields – to protect frontline workers and Canadians.
This month alone, we’ve distributed over 20 million pieces of PPE to the provinces and territories.
And we’re continuing to work around the clock to ship even more to the frontlines.
As we are doing all we can to ensure that Canadians stay healthy, we continue to step up our efforts to also keep our economy healthy.
This week is Small Business Week.
It’s a chance to recognize the enormous contribution that small businesses make to our country.
In recent weeks, I’ve talked to many entrepreneurs and business leaders, who offered some suggestions and also expressed their concerns.
Small businesses are the heart of our communities, the backbone of our economy, and our government is there for them.
We’re there for people like Charles-Ugo Boucher, owner of Café Larue, in my own riding of Papineau. The wage subsidy extension will help him keep his employees on the job.
During Small Business Week, I want to take a moment to recognize the hard work and perseverance that so many people put in every day, and especially over the last six months.
Whether you’ve adapted your menu to make take-out easier, or used your 3D printers to manufacture PPE, your resilience and creativity is an inspiration.
With winter coming, many business owners are hoping that clients won’t be turned off by having to line up outside in the cold.
As a government, our goal is to help you and your employees, through this tough time. 
From the beginning of this crisis, we took immediate and significant action to help Canadian businesses keep their door open and their workers on the job.
For small business owners:
The wage subsidy, the new Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, which will go directly to small business tenants, and the Canada Emergency Business Account are there for you.
You have shown resilience and creativity, and our government will continue to take meaningful action to support you.
Recently, I spoke with many small business owners that shared their experience with me.
Dr. Hedy Fry introduced me to Lisa Arthurs, owner of Quick Nickel Clothing in Vancouver’s West End, for whom the new Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy provides direct help as she continues to work hard to keep her business running.
Of course, the extended wage subsidy and the expanded Canada Emergency Business Account are also there to help. 
Moving forward, we will continue to listen to the needs of small businesses, just like we listen to the needs of all Canadians.
We’ll be there for people, whatever it takes, as long as it takes.  
Unfortunately, our fight against COVID-19 isn’t over, and we must continue to follow the guidelines of our local public health authorities.
Wear a mask, download the free COVID Alert App, and limit your close contacts.
And as you’re making an effort to slow the spread of the virus, why not encourage small businesses in your neighbourhood and mark Small Business Week by ordering a meal from the restaurant down the street or buying a gift card for your favourite store.
I want to end this morning by taking a moment to talk about the Community Resilience Fund, which supports partnerships and innovation in countering online radicalization to violence.
The pandemic has increased the amount of time we spend in front of our screens.
And while the digital space is powerful, it’s not without issues.
Online hate is far too common, and all too often it can spill over into real life.
Better understanding violent extremism is key to preventing radicalization to violence, so that we can stop tragedies before they happen.
So far, the Community Resilience Fund has supported 39 projects across the country with a total of over $29 million.
Today, I can announce that we will invest in the YWCA Canada’s project, Block Hate: Building Resilience against Online Hate Speech.
This is an important project, and I know it will help keep our communities safe.
To all the groups and local leaders who are part of this fund: thank you for your vital work. 
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on Small Business Week and the Community Resilience Fund,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/10/20/prime-ministers-remarks-small-business-week-and-community-resilience-fund
Thomas Jefferson,United States of America,1804-11-08 00:00:00,"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: To a people, fellow-citizens, who sincerely desire the happiness and prosperity of other nations: to those who justly calculate that their own well-being is advanced by that of the nations with which they have intercourse, it will be a satisfaction to observe that the war which was lighted up Europe a little before our last meeting has not yet extended its flames to other nations, nor been marked by the calamities which sometimes stain the footsteps of war. The irregularities, too on the ocean, which generally harass the commerce of neutral nations, have in distant parts, disturbed ours less than on former occasions; but in the American seas they have been greater from peculiar causes, and even within our harbors and jurisdiction infringements on the authority of the laws have been committed which have called for serious attention The friendly conduct of the Governments from whose officers and subjects these acts have proceeded, in other respects and in places more under their observation and control, gives us confidence that our representations on this subject will have been completely regarded. While noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean by others, those on our own part should not be omitted nor left unprovided for. Complaints have been received that persons residing within the United States have taken on themselves to arm merchant vessels and to force a commerce into certain ports and countries in defiance of the laws of those countries in defiance of the laws of those countries. That individuals should undertake to wage private war, independently of the authority of their country, can not be permitted in a well-ordered society. Its tendency to produce aggression on the laws and rights of other nations and to endanger the peace of our own is so oblivious that I doubt not you will adopt measures for restraining it effectually in future. Soon after the passage of the act of the last session authorizing the establishment of a district and a port of entry on the waters of the Mobile we learnt that its object was misunderstood on the part of Spain. Candid explanations were immediately given and assurances that, reserving our claims in that quarter as a subject of discussion and arrangement with Spain, no act was mediated in the meantime inconsistent with peace and friendship existing between the two nations, and that conformably to these intentions would be the execution of the law. That Government had, however, thought proper to suspend the ratification of the convention of 1802; but the explanations which would reach them soon after, and still more the confirmation of them by the tenor of the instrument establishing the port and district, may reasonably be expected to replace them in the dispositions and views of the whole subject which originally dictated the convention. I have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had been urged by that Government against the validity of our title to the country of Louisana have been withdrawn, its exact limits, however, remaining still to be settled between us; and to this is to be added that having prepared and delivered the stock created in execution of the convention of Paris of April 30, 1803. In consideration of the cession of that country, we have received from the Government of France an acknowledgment in due form, of the fulfillment of that stipulation. With the nations of Europe in general our friendship and intercourse are undisturbed, and from the Governments of the belligerent powers especially we continue to receive those friendly manifestations which are justly due to an honest neutrality and to such good offices consistent with that as we have opportunities of rendering. The activity and success of the small force employed in the Mediterranean in the early part of the present year, the reenforcements sent into that sea, and the energy of the officers having command in the several vessels will, I trust, by the sufferings of war, reduce the barbarians of Tripoli to the desire of peace on proper terms. Great injury, however, ensues to ourselves, as well as to others interested, from the distance to which prizes must be brought for adjudication and from the impracticability of bringing hither such as are not seaworthy. The Bey of Tunis having made requisitions unauthorized by our treaty, their rejection has produced from him some expressions of discontent. But to those who expect us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demands will not cost us less than a war we must leave as a question of calculation for them also whether to retire from unjust demands will not cost them less than a war. We can do to each other very sensible injuries by war, but mutual advantages of peace make that the best interest of both. Peace and intercourse with other powers on the same coast continue on the footing on which they are established by treaty. In pursuance of the act providing for the temporary government of Louisana, the necessary officers for the Territory of Orleans were appointed in due time to commence the exercise of their functions on the 1st. day of October. The distance, however, of some of them and indispensable previous arrangements may have retarded its commencement in some of its parts. The form of government thus provided having been considered but as temporary, and open to such future improvements as further information of the circumstances of our brethren there might suggest, it will of course be subject to your consideration. In the District of Louisana it has been thought best to adopt the division into subordinate districts which had been established under its former government. These being five in number, a commanding officer has been appointed to each, according to the provisions of the law, and so soon as they can be at their stations that district will also be in its due state of organization. In the meantime their places are supplied by the officers commanding there. And the functions of the governor and judges of Indiana having commenced, the government, we presume is preceding in its new form. The lead mines in that district offer so rich a supply of that metal as to merit attention. The report now communicated will inform you of their state and of the necessity of immediate inquiry into their occupation and titles. With the Indian tribes established within our newly acquired limits, I have deemed it necessary to open conferences for the purpose of establishing a good understanding and neighborly relations between us. So far as we have yet learned, we have reason to believe that their dispositions on their part, we have in our own hands means which can not fail us for preserving their peace and friendship. By pursuing an uniform course of justice toward them, by aiding them in all the improvements which may better their condition, and especially by establishing a commerce on terms which shall be advantageous to them and only not losing to us, and so regulated as that no incendiaries of our own or any other nation may be permitted to disturb the natural effects of our just and friendly offices, we may render ourselves so necessary to their comfort and prosperity that the protection of our citizens from their disorderly members will become their interest and their voluntary care. Instead, therefore, of an augmentation of military force proportioned to our extension of frontier, I propose a moderate enlargement of the capital employed in that commerce as a more effectual, economical, and humane instrument for preserving peace and good neighborhood with them. On this side of the Mississippi an important relinquishment of native title has been received from the Delawares. That tribe, desiring to extinguish in their people the spirit of hunting and to convert superfluous lands into the means of improving what they retain, has ceded to us all the country between Wabash and Ohio south of and including the road from the rapids toward Vincennes, for which they are to receive annuities in animals and implements for agriculture and in other necessaries. This acquisition is important, not only for its extent and fertility, but as fronting 300 miles on the Ohio, and near half that on the Wabash. The produce of the settled country descending those rivers will no longer pass in review of the Indian frontier but in a small portion, and, with the cession heretofore made by the Kaskaskias, nearly consolidates our possessions north of the Ohio, in a very respectful breadth-from Lake Erie to the Mississippi. The Piankeshaws having some claim to the country ceded by the Delawares, it has been thought best to keep quiet that by fair purchase also. So soon as the treaties on this subject shall have received their constitutional sanctions they shall be laid before both Houses. The act of Congress of February 28, 1803, for building and employing a number of gunboats, is now in a course of execution to the extent there provided for. The obstacle to naval enterprise which vessels of this construction offer for our seaport towns, their utility toward supporting within our waters the authority of the laws, the promptness with which they will be manned by the seamen and militia of the place in the moment they are wanting, the facility of their assembling from different parts of the coast to any point where they are required in greater force than ordinary, the economy of their maintenance and preservation from decay when not in actual service, and the competence of our finances to this defensive provision without any new burthen are considerations which will have due weight with Congress in deciding on the expediency of adding to their number from year to year, as experience shall test their utility, until all our important harbors, by these and auxiliary means, shall be secured against insult and opposition to the laws. No circumstances has arisen since your last session which calls for any augmentation of our regular military force. Should any improvement occur in militia system, that will be always seasonable. Accounts of the receipts and expenditures of the last year, with estimates for the ensuing one, will as usual be laid before you. The state of our finances continues to fulfill our expectations. Eleven millions and a half of dollars, received in the course of the year ending the 30th of September last, have enabled us, us, after meeting all the ordinary expenses of the year, to pay upward of $3,600,000 of the public debt, exclusive of interest. This payment, with those of the two preceding years, has extinguished upward of twelve millions of the principle and a greater sum of interest within that period, and by a proportionate diminution of interest renders already sensible the effect of the growing sum yearly applicable to the discharge of the principle. It is also ascertained that the revenue accrued during the last year exceeds that of the preceding, and the probable receipts of the ensuing year may safely be relied on as sufficient, with the sum already in the Treasury, to meet all the current demands of the year, to discharge upwards of three millions and a half of the engagements incurred under the British and French conventions , and to advance in the further redemption of the funded debt as rapidly as had been contemplated. These, fellow-citizens, are the principle matters which I have thought it necessary at this time to communicate for your consideration and attention. Some others will be laid before you in the course of the session; but in the discharge of the great duties confided to you by our country you will take a broader view of the field of legislation. Whether the great interests of agriculture, manufactures, commerce, or navigation can within the pale of your constitutional powers be aided in any of their relations; whether laws are provided in all cases where they are wanting; whether those provided are exactly what they should be; whether any abuses take place in their administration, or in that of the public revenues; whether the organization of the public agents or of the public force is perfect in all its parts; in fine, whether anything can be done to advance the general good, are questions within the limits of your functions which will necessarily occupy your attention. In these and all other matters which you in your wisdom may propose for the good of our country you may count with assurance on my hearty cooperation and faithful execution.
",Fourth Annual Message,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Louise Casey,United Kingdom,2015-11-26,"Good morning everybody. I’m very pleased to be with you today and honoured to have been asked to address you at this important event. Thank you Polly for inviting me.
I head up the Troubled Families programme for government, a programme to turn around the lives of 120,000 families where kids aren’t going to school, where youth crime and anti-social behaviour are a problem and where parents are out of work.
Before taking on this role, I did other jobs on victims, crime, anti-social behaviour and homelessness for governments of different persuasions.
Some of you will know me from the voluntary sector and I have had a long association with Women’s Aid and others from the sector represented in the room today.
I know times are hard, austerity measures are tough and I can see that many colleagues out there are struggling.
I know that you are doing very difficult jobs in difficult circumstances and so I hope you’ll take what I have to say today as an important recognition of the work you do day in day out.
I’m glad that you’ve given me the chance to share with you some reflections, having spent 2 years in this job listening to troubled families from cities to shires and to the workers who help them change.
It would be true to say that I rarely have a conversation with troubled families where domestic violence does not feature.
Most troubled families I meet, yes, they are families where no one is working, where children don’t go to school, where there is anti-social behaviour and crime.
They are also, in many cases, families where parents themselves grew up with violence, families where mothers have fled violence only to end up with another controlling man.
Whether domestic violence is the cause or the symptom, what I have learnt from listening to them is that:
– their problems are multiple
– their problems layer one on top of the other
– and their problems are intergenerational
When I listen to troubled families, they nearly all talk about:
– a history of physical violence and sexual abuse, often going back generations
– the involvement of the care system in the lives of both parents and their children
– parents starting to have children very young and being unable to deal with them
– those parents in violent relationships
– and the children going on to have behavioural problems
– leading to exclusion from school, anti-social behaviour, crime and worklessness
These are families on the edge in every way – on the edge of eviction, on the edge of custody, on the edge of care.
What shocks me more than their problems in a way is the normalisation of those problems – the matter of fact way they accept what has happened and is happening to them, because it is ‘normal’ in their experience, it was ‘normal’ when they were growing up.
A few months back, I met a woman called Linda, 28 years old, 3 children from 3 different fathers.
Her 14 year old girl out of school, committing crime, hanging around with older men who did not see her as a child.
Her 13 year old sister not in school enough and too much at home or on the street and following in the footsteps of her sister.
Finally, Linda had brought an 8 year old into this world with another man and endured 8 years of violence at his hands, witnessed by that 8 year old child and the 2 teenage girls.
Linda had been caught for shoplifting and other thieving and was under a probation order. Family intervention got involved when she stopped turning up to see her probation officer.
When I met her, I asked her how she ended up there and she told me she’d experienced violence and abuse throughout her childhood. She had her first child at 14, a series of violent partners, she got addicted to drugs.
Taking Linda, a woman who has lived a life of abuse, who is from a family of abusers and simply categorising her as a shoplifter and dealing with her shoplifting would not get us anywhere.
Helping her deal with domestic violence was central to her recovery. Now, the violent man is out of her life, she’s off drugs and all 3 kids are back in school.
Last week, we sent out a survey to all 152 local authority troubled families coordinators asking them about domestic violence.
Within hours, I had responses from 55 councils – that shows me for a start, it’s a big issue for them.
By the end of the week over 100 of the 152 had replied. Every single one of them said that they use domestic violence as a local criteria for including families in the troubled families programme.
In this survey, we also asked about the levels of domestic violence in the families being worked with in the troubled families programme.
Four in 10 said that domestic violence is an issue in more than half of their cases. For some it’s a problem in more than 3 quarters of the families they work with.
So, in turning around the lives of 22,000 families which colleagues in local areas have done so far, we have learnt a lot through this process, that these families are best helped with family intervention, but as part of that, the domestic violence must be dealt with.
Can I explain quickly what I mean by family intervention. It is:
– a dedicated worker dedicated to the family – someone who the family knows by name and who is alongside them helping them to change; not making an assessment, going away and sending them a letter 6 weeks later
– that dedicated worker needs an assertive and challenging approach – they don’t go away when the door is closed in their face or back off when a family won’t engage
– that dedicated, assertive worker needs to look at what’s really happening for the family as a whole – but in situations where there is violence or coercive control, looking at what’s happening for the family as a whole may mean actually helping to get him out of the house or rescuing her to a place of safety
– the worker gives practical hands-on support – so in 1 family I met the breakthrough with the mother came when the worker sorted out beds for the kids and a skip for all the rubbish in the garden, which included all the internal doors in the house
The mother then told her that the reason the doors were all off their hinges and dumped in the garden was because the kids had asked for them to be taken off. Although the man was now gone, following years of violence in the house, they were terrified of what went on behind closed doors.
And the mother was overwhelmed. You could classify this as a domestic violence case mental health case, you could classify it as an anti-social behaviour case, you could classify it as a rent arrears case.
But it was a troubled families case, where the mum and the family were living with a legacy of domestic violence and the bridge-building with that woman started with a practical solution and a skip.
And finally for family intervention to work, other agencies need to agree to the plan for the family – specialist workers may need to be called in at the right time, but essentially, the mantra is 1 family, 1 plan, 1 worker.
What is clear when talking to families and to workers is that 5 factors of family intervention I’ve just described are underpinned and made possible by the relationship built by the worker with the family.
This is something you may see and do in your day to day work.
Good workers start not with a long list of agencies’ requirements but by finding out where the family want to start.
They are curious about their lives, their past, their interactions with each other.
It’s striking that families often say, ‘nobody had ever asked me that before’.
Nobody had asked the right question before that meant the mother opened up about the abuse in her past.
Nobody had ever elicited before the level of the violence from her current partner.
Good workers go into people’s homes and uncover what’s really going on.
We know that when troubled families cases are referred, they are not always referred because of domestic violence. We find that out once the worker has gone in. It is only by working with the family that we find out is really happening.
Violence has not been reported and the signs of violence have not been put together: the police callouts logged as non-crime; the child out of school because they don’t want to leave their mother; the regular visits to GP complaining of unspecified problems, or repeat sleeping pill prescriptions, anti-depressants, or hair falling out.
As one troubled families co-ordinator said that while more than 3 quarters of their cases involved domestic violence they rarely know about it until after they’ve started work with the family – they uncover it once they’re in the home.
Sometimes that’s because data isn’t shared. Sometimes that’s because women keep violence a secret, for fear of losing their children; or because when they did make a disclosure, the right help wasn’t there.
Sometimes that’s because the consequences of facing up to a violent relationship – leaving with all that this entails – are just too much.
Problems with money, problems with housing, problems having to uproot your kids. As one local coordinator of domestic violence services said to me the other day, ‘the thing is, there can be so much to lose when they leave’.
And they’re afraid. They’re afraid if they stay and they’re afraid if you go. The fear is overwhelming.
That’s where the right intervention from the right person at the right time comes in.
So one worker talked to me about a family where she only ever saw the mum. ‘Where’s their dad?’ she asked. ‘Oh, he’s upstairs, he doesn’t come down in the day’. And yet it was obvious he was a controlling influence in the house – the kids were told they’d be sent up to see him if they misbehaved. There was a sense of fear.
It is not that family intervention workers are ‘jacks of all trades’, they are masters of one – the relationship.
Good workers are both kind and tough.
I’m always struck when I meet these families that so many, if not all, of the influences in their lives are negative – they are so isolated.
The relationship with the worker is not a friendship; it is more like a life buoy in a storm, until they can be pulled to a place of safety and away from a place of danger.
And that’s what a refuge is too of course. It’s not just commissioning bricks and mortar. It is more than a roof over someone’s head.
Maslow’s hierarchy of need shows us that basic needs for food, shelter and safety must be met first, then we can hope to improve someone’s self-esteem and relationships with others.
The key therefore to all of this is the relationship, the human interaction.
It is not when someone is told they must change, but when someone comes along with the skill to make them feel they want to change.
I don’t want to make this sound easy – none of this is easy.
Not for the mother, not for the families, not for the system.
Nearly 2 years ago, I met a young woman who I’ll call Carly. Carly had been with a violent partner for years. He had actually been imprisoned for violence towards her in the past, but she hadn’t left him. They had a 6 year old child together and she was expecting a second child.
Both her 6 year old and unborn child were on the child protection register.
I’m quoting now from the worker who first came into Carly’s life at this low point. She said:
She was told what she needed to do but not how to and she was left to do it all. It was Carly who had to keep him away when he came out of prison, it was Carly this and Carly that and it was about making sure it was achievable because you know, it’s one thing saying you must not allow him into your property, but if he wants to come to that property and put a brick through your window he is going to come and do that.
There was a day when they were doing activities with the child and Carly had a black eye and when asked what happened, she said she fell or something and I just went over and said, ‘you’re lying’.
I said I can go and find out whether you’re lying because you must either have been to hospital or the police were called. And because by that time we had a relationship, I could challenge her. And then we talked about what her options were.
And we said we’re not leaving you to the wolves, we aren’t leaving you.
So for Carly, having that worker alongside her, knowing she wasn’t going to be ‘left to the wolves’, gave her the courage to leave that violent man, the strength to stay away for good and the determination to be a good mother to her children.
A year after I first met Carly, I went back to see her again. She looked like a different woman. Her children were off child protection, they were thriving and she was thinking about her future in a different way – she actually joked with me that she wanted to become a family intervention worker, so important had that relationship been to her.
But it wasn’t easy, not for Carly and not for the worker.
I’m quoting again from Carly’s worker:
It is uncomfortable stuff we do – we have to put ourselves in an uncomfortable situation because that’s what we’re asking of the families.
People working with these families may well be working in an ‘uncomfortable’ space. It’s not always a cosy, comfortable relationship. There has to be challenge as well as support.
Serious case review after serious case review talks about a lack of challenge by professionals. It is not easy to ask the most uncomfortable questions or think the unthinkable. It wasn’t easy for Carly’s worker to say to her, ‘Look, I know you’re lying’.
We have to ask ourselves does this parent have the capability, the capacity and the willingness to change?
This isn’t easy for the system, but we’ve got to be tough where people won’t change. There’s a balancing act between the rights of the child and the rights of the woman and to be frank, taking entrenched positions doesn’t help.
And within that, we must acknowledge that domestic violence is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men against women.
We all know the statistics – women make up 89% of those who are repeat victims of violence. Two women die every week at the hands of their male partners or ex partners.
So when I talk about violence in the wider context of the family, in no way do I want to divert attention from that reality. I’m not suggesting domestic violence affects everyone equally, regardless of gender.
But what we are seeing in these families are the consequences of violence being left to fester:
– the transmission of violence from one generation to the next
– the effects on children as they grow up
– and violence becoming the normal way of life
In one case I know of, Debbie was the victim of domestic violence, and her children had witnessed their father abusing her. He had also lent her out to other men for sex.
When the family intervention worker asked her about the past, Debbie said that growing up her partner had watched his step-father battering his mother, his mother was violent to her children and his brother remembers ‘battering a lad with a wooden handle’ at primary school; another brother had tried to strangle him.
I’m not making excuses for this man’s violent behaviour – I’m trying to illustrate that violence is intergenerational and its destruction can spread throughout the family.
It often doesn’t take long for the pattern of violence to start repeating itself. If nobody works with the mother to build her resilience, it may not be long before another controlling or violent man is in her life.
If nobody works with the children to help them deal with what they’ve witnessed or been subjected to, by the time they move from primary to secondary school they are replicating the violence or doing it even younger to their brothers and sisters.
If nobody works with the father, then he’ll continue to go on to do it others – not necessarily a subject for today, but one that we must come back to.
We have to get to kids younger and we have to do something to change these families who are being destroyed by violence.
That might start with empowering the woman, giving her the support she needs to end the violent relationship. But our response can’t end there – the children who have witnessed that violence deserve more.
One very experienced worker put it like this, and again, I’m quoting:
What this child is exhibiting are all the classic signs of post traumatic stress, because the houses that they’ve been living in have been like war zones.
So I’m glad that local authorities are already using the local criteria to help those suffering from domestic violence through the Troubled families programme.
Last summer, the government announced an expansion to our troubled families programme, seeking to extend help to a further 400,000 families from next year
We know that domestic violence will be an issue in many of these families and therefore it will become a focus of the extended scheme.
It is human interactions that are at the core of this.
It is the behaviour of human beings that dictates what it feels like for a neighbour to live in a community, for a woman to live in a relationship, for a child to live in a family.
Many of you, of course, are dealing with wider issues around domestic violence, but for me, the troubled families programme is about changing the most difficult families.
If we continue spending all the resources we have been on the highest need families we will never have enough money for all the others out there who we also want to help.
I say to you today, please support this programme because we have got a once in a generation opportunity to break the cycle.
But it’s not without its challenges and one of those is the challenge of early intervention.
Together we need to work out how we how we share data in the right way that helps women who present at their GPs suffering the signs of domestic violence, but do that in a safe and secure way.
Together we need to work out how we get to those 6 year old boys already hitting out at school and the solution doesn’t lie in a prescription for Ritalin.
Together we need to work out, how we get perpetrator programmes that work, how we track violent men once the woman’s left or got him out of the house to stop him starting again with another woman, in front of another 3 children.
I know none of this is easy. Many of us in this room have been working in these sectors for years.
There are a lot of people out there who think that we can’t change these families. Who think it’s just not possible.
And could live with a country where the kids in the families never go to school, their parents never get a job and their lives are never improved.
Well I don’t agree with that. I hope that you don’t either.
So whether it’s colleagues from the domestic violence sector in the room today, those from the children’s sector, those from local government charged with delivering our own troubled families programme,
We must stand together to tackle intergenerational disadvantage, abuse and violence.
I’ll do whatever I can to support you in what you’re doing to help stop violence and abuse.
And I hope you’ll support me in trying to help the most vulnerable and troubled families.
And together we can give the children in these families chance of hope for the future.
",2014 Speech to Women’s Aid Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/louise-casey-2014-speech-to-womens-aid-conference/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-03-22,"Good morning.
Well, it's a shame. It's a horrible thing and what's going on in Brussels, it used to be one of the great places of the world. I don't know if Gerard is with you. I don't have a television in front of me --
Right. Hi, Gerry.
So -- So -- so sad to see and as Gerry can tell you, and as I can tell you, Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show, it's an absolute horror show. And I'm not just talking about today. I'm saying you go to Brussels it feels like an armed camp and even then they can't do much about what's happening. So there's a sick problem going on, Maria.
Well, I think the reason I'm leading in the Republican side by a lot -- by a tremendous margin -- is the fact that I'm very strong on borders. I mean, I've been very, very strong from the beginning. I came out strong on trade, strong on borders and that was the initial and then you had the Paris attack and we started talking more in terms of military, also.
But we have to strengthen up our borders a lot. And you know in the southern border, we're going to build a wall. We're going to absolutely build a wall.
But people are coming into our country. We have no idea who they are. We have a very serious problem because thousands of people are coming in from the migration.
You know, the migration in Syria. We're taking in -- President Obama is taking in thousands of people, distributing all over the United States, we don't even know how many and nobody even knows where they're going and these are people that have no documentation, they have no anything, nobody knows anything about many of the people that we're bringing into our country and it's going to lead to, you know, just catastrophic problems. If you look at what's going on in Paris, if you look at what's going on, I mean, Brussels we know, but look at what's going on in Germany.
Look at Germany. Who would have ever thought this was happening? And Germany has been doing very poorly. Ill tell you, I have people that -- friends that live in Germany, they want to leave. They want to get out. They say what's happening in the streets is from a different world. So, you know, these leaders are not very good leaders. You know, she's somebody I had a great deal of respect for, I have lost all respect.
Merkel, yes.
And a lot of support, Gerry, too. You know, it got tremendous support.
Yeah. It's time to stop that absolutely, Gerry. And frankly, look, we're having problems with the Muslims and we're having problems with Muslims coming into the country and we are seeing it, whether it's California where they killed the 14 people, the two young married couple, I guess she possibly radicalized him, nobody knows.
She came here on a fiance visa, she came in, they say that he wasn't radicalized, but he was radicalized after he met her and they killed 14 coworkers that gave them a baby shower. They gave a shower for their baby, and they were friends and they walked in and shot them all, killed them all, and plenty of wounded in the hospital. You look at Paris where they have frankly, you know, you talk about guns, but in Paris they have the toughest gun laws in the world and you have a situation there where you have 130 people just killed for no reason whatsoever, just killed.
Nobody -- no bullets going in the opposite direction, that I can tell you, because nobody had guns.
Which was a big mistake, I agree.
Oh yeah. You need surveillance. You have to deal with the mosques, whether we like it or not, I mean, you know, these attacks aren't coming out of -- they're not done by Swedish people.
That I can tell you. You have to be very -- Look, we have to be smart, we have to be vigilant. We have to watch very closely what's going on.
We have to look at the mosques. We have to study what's going on. Now in the old system under New York, they were infiltrating mosques, they were getting great information from what people were saying, that we were stopping attacks and let's see, now this current mayor, who frankly is a mayor that he doesn't know what he's doing, he's doing a terrible job according to everybody, but this current mayor ended that entire program.
Ended it entirely. And that was a big mistake. If you speak to the police commissioner, you speak to Ray Kelly and some of the people that really do know what they're doing, that was a tremendous loss for New York when we ended our vigilance.
Right. I wonder how many -- I wonder how many Muslims Cuba is taking every year. I wonder if they're setting up a little area in Cuba for the Muslim population.
Right, I have not spoken to them, but I will tell you whatever they tell me, and they're going to be advisors and highly respected, as you know. You know some of them. Some of them have been on your show many times.
But Walid is an example. But I will tell you that matter what they say I'm still for very strong borders. We have to close our borders, make them so strong and let people into our country, but they have to be people that are going to be wonderful for our country.
You know, we do Lottery systems and I don't think -- I think we should do it based on merit, based on their background, if they've been wonderful people where they were. We're taking in people into our country we know nothing about it and the most serious version of that is what's coming in from Syria. We're taking people in with zero documentation and you know, Maria and Gerry, I can tell you that I've spoken to every law enforcement, top people, there is no way you can tell anything about these people about documentation, because it's all gone.
It's all gone. And yet it's a strange thing because they have no documentation, they have no anything and yet they're walking in the migration line, young men using cell phones. Okay?
Well, I'm feeling very, very good. Arizona, I think I'm going to do fantastically and Utah, I was there and I had a great reception and I'll see how I do in Utah. In Arizona, we had -- I mean, we had 21,000 people and we had 6,000 people and things were set up a couple of days in advance.
The second one was set up like 14 hours in advance and we had 6,000 people and we would have had many more except that the agitators, I call them agitators, you know, it's a professional organization, but they blocked the road and they blocked some entrances and things like that, but actually they're very safe. You know, despite what you read, these are very safe. What goes on there is love fests, believe me.
These are great people that, you know, the expression is ""Make America great again."" That's what we're going to do. Make America great again. Great people. So, the Arizona is going on today, the Utah is going on today and I think we're going to do very well. I'm leading by a lot and I hope to continue that trend.
Well, I think they didn't need too much reassurance because I have been very strong on Israel. But I wanted -- I had great detail in that speech, as you know, Gerry, and I wanted to make sure I got it exactly right. So I did it from a teleprompter and I got very nice praise.
I mean, and honestly, Gerry, it's a lot easier than doing it the way I normally would do it because I have a good memory. So I'll memorize facts and I'll get up and I'll do it and honestly this was easier and I got tremendous notices. I don't know -- I wonder how ""The Wall Street Journal"" treated me? I don't know. I have to go -- I'm going to read it in about two minutes.
No, I know that. But it's nice to have you both on because you did one of the really good debates together. A good part of the team, right?
Two thirds of the team. It was a great team.
Well, I think what I've been saying for the last year. We have to be very, very strong at our borders and our borders don't just mean our southern border. That means people coming in by airplane and people coming in even on the northern side.
But we have to be very, very strong on our borders and we have to be vigilant. We have to see if there's something going on. People have to report.
You know, this guy that they caught yesterday, he was living right in this neighborhood. He was living there with all of these people, they all knew he was there, they didn't turn him in. There's something going on that's wrong, and if you look at Paris and you look at places like Belgium it's not a good situation. What's happening now worldwide is not a good situation. We can't let it happen to our country, and it is happening, by the way. People are coming in that shouldn't be coming into this country.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
",Interview: Donald Trump Interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-fox-business-bartiromo-march-22-2016
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-06-23,"Please sit down.
We love you, too. We love you, too. Well, I want to thank everybody. This is great. And, you know, they have me really working. I gave a speech and a roundtable, and then another roundtable, and then another speech, and here we are. Right?
So I want to thank Dean Heller, who has been an incredible senator -- worked so hard with us to get the taxes cut. Very simple. You know, I talk about reform, but it's really tax cut. There was plenty of reform also, but we had one of the great tax -- really, the greatest tax cut and reforms ever in our country's history, the biggest. And so I want to thank you. That was a fantastic job. Dean Heller.
And your attorney general, Adam, who is running for governor, I think you're going to do great.
I want to thank a friend of mine, Steve Witkoff. You know, people don't realize Steve started out as a lawyer -- a very good lawyer, a top lawyer in New York. And then he said, ""I'm going to go in the real estate business because I can do this, too."" He saw me do it..
Steve was a great -- actually, he was a great real estate lawyer. And he represented a lot of us from the Manhattan real estate world. And one day, he said, ""Hey, maybe I'll do this."" And he bought a little building, and it worked out. Then he did another one, and it worked out. And now he has a lot of them, and he's become a very wealthy, successful man. And he's my pal. And it's nice that you're here, Steve. Thank you very much.
So I want to just tell you that what we've done has not been done before. We've created a lot of different things. We're going to talk about taxes, but just briefly -- regulation cuts, the biggest in history. Nobody has ever cut regulations. We're talking about 511 days so far.
And you can go four years, you can go eight years, you can go sixteen years -- doesn't make any difference; nobody has cut regulations like we have. Nobody has created tax cuts like we have. Nobody is going to protect your Second Amendment like we will.
Every single -- you know, for a lot of the small business owners -- and, to me, this is very important -- the estate tax. These small business owners, the farmers, all of the people that we love and we cherish -- no more estate tax. The old days, they had to go out and get financing and put it up, right up to the neck.
And then they had to pay interest, and in many cases they couldn't do it. And, Steve, they'd lose their farms; they'd lose their businesses; they'd lose whatever. And we've cut the estate tax. And for the smaller businesses, there is no estate tax whatsoever. So families can leave their business to their sons and daughters.
The Heritage Foundation just came out recently, and they said that we've already implemented 64 percent of our top agenda items. And that's ahead of anybody, including Ronald Reagan. So we've done a lot of work in a very short period of time. And you know, the bottom line is: America is open for business.
I got elected on ""Make America Great Again."" We started using ""America First,"" and that's what we're doing. On trade, we're renegotiating some of these horrible trade deals that we have with other countries. We have some of the worst deals I've ever seen. Whether it's China, the European Union, Mexico, Canada -- you name it, we have a bad deal. And we're changing those deals.
We lost, last year, $800 billion -- with a ""b"" -- $800 billion on trade. And, in fact, I want to be very precise because Steve is such a great lawyer. It's $817 billion, to be exact. Right? That's big money. That makes everything we do like a little tiny peanut. And we can't do that. We can't do that. And we're not going to do that.
So we're negotiating deals. The steel industry -- I don't know if you've been seeing what's happening, but the steel industry is coming back. United States Steel is expanding. We're building brand new plants and beautiful new expansions. They haven't done it in 35 years.
Another company -- a wonderful steel company -- just announced a $500 million plant today. Another one is going into Ohio. We have Ohio, Pennsylvania. We have all of these incredible places. They're seeing the steel industry come back.
And I need it to come back. We need it for defense. You know, steel isn't like some other industries. Steel, we need. Aluminum, we need. We're having tremendous activity in the world of aluminum now. So we put a 25 percent tax, or tariff, on steel coming in. They were dumping steel all over our country. Now, all of the sudden, if they want to dump, that's okay; they have to pay a lot of money to dump.
But more importantly, our industry is coming back far faster than we thought. If other countries aren't going to treat us with respect and aren't going to treat us properly on trade -- because they haven't with these massive deficits that we have. The big one is a car tax. They send in cars into our country by the millions and millions and millions, and we pay -- I mean, if we send cars to them, they either don't want it or it's a big tax.
As an example, if we send a car into China, they charge 25 percent. When China sends a car to us, we charge 2.5 percent. Right? So we're going to change it. And we're going to get along great with China. We're going to get along great with everybody, hopefully, in the end. But we have to change it. It's very -- it's not fair. It's not fair to our companies, and it's not fair to our workers.
One of the big things we just did is we had a great meeting, as you know, and a very successful one with North Korea. And the relationships is now very good. The total denuclearization of North Korea, and the process is beginning. And further talks are going on.
We're getting our -- the remains back of our great heroes. There have been -- so many people asked me, ""Could you do it?"" The remains are coming back. This is something -- we never got anything back, anybody back. And so many -- I guess, for the most part, it would be the children and the grandchildren, they want to get the remains back of their fathers and their grandfathers. And we're starting that, and it's been really incredible.
We got our hostages back. And the New York Times said, ""Well, Obama got hostages back, too."" Yeah, but he paid $1.8 billion.8 billion. We didn't pay a penny. We paid nothing.
But, at the same time, North Korea was very smart. What they did was very smart. And they made it -- they made it so that we got them back, and they are now living with their families, very happily. And that was two months ago. They're living very happily with their families. And that was something that was great.
And very importantly -- most importantly, you haven't had any rockets shot over Japan. You haven't had missiles going over Japan. You haven't had any nuclear tests in the last seven months. You haven't had any tests of any kind in the last number of months.
Sites have been blown up, where they had the testing. They're getting rid of their engine site, the engines -- these are engines. They call them ""engines"" for ballistic missiles. That's going. And, step by step, it's really working out well.
And most importantly, I have a very good relationship. We have a good chemistry together. We get along very well. He's a smart, tough guy. He's a great negotiator. I think he sees a tremendous future for North Korea. But we want to have it denuclearized, and that's what's happening.
So that was a great visit. It was two-day visit. It was a great visit. It was really quite something. We'll get it done.
And China helped us at the border, I have to tell you, President Xi really helped us at the border. And Japan -- Prime Minister Abe was terrific. And the President of South Korea, we really worked well together -- President Moon. And it's a great team. I mean, honestly, it's a great team. And we did things that everybody said were really impossible to do. Nobody would have believed it.
If you remember, before I got elected, it sounded like we were going to war with North Korea. And that was a war that could have cost the lives of 50 million people. You know, Seoul -- Steve, when we think New York City is big -- Seoul, which is 30 miles off the border of North Korea, has 28 million people, Steve. Twenty-eight million. So, New York, we have 8 million, and we think New York is big. Seoul has 28 million people. And it's literally not even nuclear distance; it's right there for their -- they call them ""cannons."" They have thousands of cannons aimed at Seoul.
And we think that everyone is going to be very safe. We'll keep going with this, but everyone is going to be very safe. I think we've made tremendous progress, and it really was a lot quicker than anybody thought possible.
So we're doing very well, and I'd like to -- maybe we'll start off and we can talk about -- you can ask questions or make some suggestions. But maybe I'll ask Adam -- do you want to start the process?
Thanks.
Very good. Thank you, Adam. Thank you. Steve, go ahead. After that build-up I gave you, you better do a good job.
He did good. He did good. Well, I knew Andrew, and he was a great young man. And he -- with a great family -- a father who loved him, a mother who loved him. Great, great people.
So I just want to say that it's an honor what you just said. You know, I looked at that site. And then I said, ""Nope. I'm going to run for President instead.
From Carl?
I can imagine. With Carl, it's never easy. But that's great. It's going to be a great success. A beautiful location. And I saw a concept and a design, and it's going -- it is really going to be a tremendous success. So congratulations. That's great.
Barbara, go ahead.
Well, thank you very much, Barbara. Thank you very much. I just want to see where he is, relative to what I think he could have bought for. I know he made a good deal.
We have a very special person with us who has become a friend of mine, Alex Acosta. He's the head of the Department of Labor. He's Secretary of Labor. And he's just unveiled a healthcare plan. You can call it ""association plan,"" you can call it whatever you want, but it's going to be millions and millions of people, where they're going to have tremendous negotiating rights to buy healthcare with the insurance companies. You can cross state lines. That means you have a lot more competition.
And he's just done a tremendous job as the Secretary of Labor. And I want to ask you to say a few words, Alex, please.
And she's a great negotiator. Great negotiator. You're going to have fun. They're all going to be out after -- they want that. You know, the insurance companies are going crazy for this. So you're going to have a lot of fun. Good luck. Thanks, Mary Beth. Make a good deal.
Where are they? Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Cavin. Thank you very much.
Yes, absolutely. Thank you. He did a good job, right? Did he do a good job? Thank you, Cavin. Very nice. Appreciate it.
Oh, thank you. That's tough to beat. Can you beat that, Ryan? I don't know.
Good.
Go ahead, Jason.
Well, thank you, Jason. That's very nice. Very, very nice. Thank you. And, Jason, great hair, number one. He's done an incredible job, really. So give him my regards. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jason.
Please. Rich?
That's great.
Wow.
Well, thank you very much. A very good time, isn't it? Back and forth. Now, did you practice that? That was really -- good timing. Thank you.
So a friend of mine, somebody that's really been in the trenches with us, he fought very hard with all of the Republicans -- we had no Democrat support; it was too bad. And I think it's going to come to haunt them. But Dean Heller -- Senator Dean Heller has been somebody that really got in and he fought as hard as anybody I know to make sure that you got that tax cut and reform, and that everybody else in our country got it.
And they're very happy about it. And the Democrats are actually now saying they've got a problem, because it's worked out far better than anyone thought. And when you add the regulations and all of the other things we've been doing, it's a great combination.
And while you're all talking about the economy is doing well, it's going to get a lot better. Expensing is something, Ryan, that, as you call him your boss, Michael would know very much about. But one-year expensing is, I think, going to be the sleeper in the bill. We have another where, literally, trillions of dollars are going to come back into the country.
Apple has already agreed they're going to be investing $350 billion. They're bringing approximately $230 billion back from overseas, where you would have never seen that money again without what we did in terms of the reform on the tax cuts. So there's just one example where Apple is spending $350 billion.
And you have many companies doing that. You have many, many companies. They're spending money. And it's really something very beautiful to see. It's jobs, it's imagination. So many different elements are at play. But our country is doing really well and it's going to even do better.
We're working very hard on the border with the immigration. We have to be very strong on immigration, but we have to let people in, the right people, where we have a merit-based system.
And that's working out very good. But we do have to be very strong. And if we're not, you're going to have millions and millions of people come up, and it's not going to be a good situation. It will be a very bad situation.
If you look at what the Democrats are doing -- and Dean understands this better than anybody -- if you look at what they're doing, they want to have a very weak border, a very open border, and that's going to lead to tremendous crime and a lot of problems for a lot of people, including jobs. It's going to be a very bad situation.
So we're working very hard on it. It will get done. It will get done properly. We have to be very vigilant and strong. But a lot of good things are happening.
So I want to just introduce Dean Heller, a real champion, a hard, hard worker, and a total winner. And he's got a tough race but I think I saw a poll just a little while ago that looks very, very promising, very good, even beyond what we thought. I don't even want to tell you, because maybe you'll ease up and I don't want him to ease up.
Because it's going to be a tough race. But he's going to win that race. And we need you back in Washington. And he has really been an incredible messenger. Thank you, Dean.
We're doing very well. You've probably seen 3.2, which people would have said would have been impossible. And there's only a projection, so who knows what that means. But the Atlanta Fed just predicted 4.8, right?
4.8?
Who knows what it will be. I will say this: Each point is said to be $3 trillion. Think of that. So, you know, a point, two points, three points. But each point is said to be $3 trillion. And each point is said to be 10 million jobs. So I think we're going to do very well.
Superman.
Thank you very much. It's been just a great place. From my standpoint, Nevada is special. It's been -- so many friends, so many friends just in the audience. And we have to get our friends into office. We need him there very badly.
If that doesn't happen, and if other things would happen, you're going to have a massive tax increase and you're going to have a regulation increase, and it's not going to be a good situation. A lot of bad things will go on. And we can't let that happen. It's going to be a nasty race. It's already started to be nasty; pretty much all of them are, for some reason. Nobody really knows why.
But, you know, it has been this way before. I said to one of the senators, Dean, I said, has it always been this nasty? And I won't tell you which two or three administrations, but he actually -- he's been around a long time -- he named three different times when he thought it was worse.
I said, that's pretty hard to believe. But it's tough stuff, but we're winning. We're winning like nobody has ever won before. And we want to keep it going. Thank you all much. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Roundtable on Tax Reform in Las Vegas,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-tax-reform-roundtable-las-vegas-june-23-2018
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-04-12,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you. We love you. We love this area. Many, many friends up here, folks. And we've been -- in terms of the state, we've all been suffering together. You know that, right? But it is going to change. And we apologize for airplane hangers, but they're the only things that hold our crowds because something's going on. The fact is there's a movement going on and it's happening all over the country and it's people like yourselves, and we're going to turn our country around.
We're going to take our jobs back because they're going, they're going by the thousands every single week. And they're going to China and they're going to Mexico and they're going to any country that touches us with a trade deal because our negotiators have no idea whatsoever what they're doing, OK? So we're going to turn it around and we're going to turn it around very quickly.
I just, you know, in coming up, I wanted to read -- do you mind if I take this coat off, do you mind? All right. Come on. There's so many warm people, they're warm, they're warm and we will not use Carrier air conditioning to cool it down because they're moving to Mexico. We're not going to use them, right?
Not gonna use them. But you know, I did some a glitter work in the area and I'll tell you what, not good. But it's going to be good. Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave for warmer climates. You know, I won Florida by a lot and I love Florida. But don't leave for Florida. We're going to bring it back. Don't leave, OK? But listen to this.
Your county has lost 60% of its manufacturing jobs since 1980, 6%. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Utica Rome region has lost more than half of its manufacturing jobs since 1990. Now more than half, folks. Factors: NAFTA, which was, as you know, voted on by a certain person that's running.
We won't mention names. Voted on by somebody. The Asian currency manipulation, which I've been talking about for a long time and nobody even understands it but me. It's called devaluation and China entrance into the World Trade Organization has been a total disaster for you and for this region. So listen to this, according to Labor Bureau Statistics, Utica Rome region lost nearly 40% of its manufacturing jobs since 2001. What's going on? Is anybody working up here?
We got to change this. All right, it's terrible. Total private employment has shrunk nearly 10% in a short period of time. Medium household, this is something, median household income in New York state today is $3,700 less per year than it was in 1989, inflation adjusted. Folks, what the hell is going on? We're gonna bring it back.
We're gonna bring it back. New York State has lost three out of four, think of that, three out of every four manufacturing jobs that existed in 1960 is gone. That's right. I agree with you. But I'm not allowed -- I'm not allowed to use that term. If I use that term, the dishonest press does a big number, so I can't do it. Shout out whatever you want, I'll just say, I agree, all right?
. This TPP, by the way, and fast track trading is a total disaster for this area and for our country and they're in favor of it and I'm against it. And boy, am I right. It's going to make NAFTA look like a baby. It's worse than NAFTA, and you better make sure your politicians don't approve it. When I get in office, I'll do real trade deals where we're going to bring our jobs back.
Just rely on it, folks. All right, rely on it. Rely on it. So -- but isn't that amazing? I said, give me a little information on the area. I know the area well. I thought you were doing better than that. So here's the story. I was just talking to some of the very talented reporters backstage and you know the system, folks, is rigged.
It's a rigged system. Now, you have to understand, I'm not complaining about the states that I won. Those are OK, of which I won I think 22 and Cruz won 10. Did you ever hear him say, I'm the only one -- remember lying Ted Cruz, lying Ted, has the Bible up here puts it down. He's a liar. Oh boy, does he lie.
But the system's rigged. And I'll tell you what, when you look at Colorado and people could say, oh well, that's the way the game is played. Look, they should have had an election. They didn't have an election. That system is set up so that the crooked politicians can make sure they get somebody in that's not, you know, part of what we're doing.
This is a movement, folks. I've self funding my campaign. They hate it. They hate it. They don't want me to self fund my campaign. They don't want it because you know what? They're all controlled by their special interests. They're all controlled by their lobbyist, 100%. So when it comes time to making trade deals, military deals, any deals, the lobbyist goes this, you can't do this.
This guy gave you a million dollars. This guy gave you $10 million. This group or this country gave you $5 million. You can't do it. And they said, OK, I won't do it with me. They didn't give me anything, folks, OK? I'm working for you. I'm working for you. So I our Republican system, our republican system is absolutely rigged.
It's a phony deal. Now, what do I know? I started running like nine months ago. Who would have thought I would have been in first place? What do I know, right? What do I know? But I'm in first place by a lot, millions and millions of votes. That doesn't count. You noticed? Nobody even talks about votes. I have millions of votes more, but I also have hundreds of delegates more.
But that's not the same thing to me. I think the vote is the thing that you count, right? The vote. And you look at some of these systems where the people that devised them and this had to do with Ron Paul, it had to do with a hole, they wanted to keep people out. This was a dirty trick. These are dirty tricksters.
This is a dirty trick. And I'll tell you what, the RNC, the Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen. I can tell you that. They should be ashamed of themselves because it has nothing to do with democracy. They took the votes away from the people in Colorado.
People are burning up their Republican cards because they want to vote. And you got to see what's happening out there. It's actually a thing of beauty, if you want to know the truth because they're not going to take it. And they may -- it may be shoved down their face and who knows, but you know what, they're fighting and they're all over the place and they're angry.
Their votes have been taken away. We've already been disenfranchised because you look at what's going on. Because if you think about it, the economy is rigged, the banking system is rigged, there's a lot of things that are rigged in this world of ours and that's why a lot of you haven't had an effective wage increase in 20 years, folks.
And we're going to change it. We're going to change it. Gonna change it fast. So I'm no fan of Bernie Sanders, right? Believe me. Well, though, we do have one thing in common. What's the one thing? We actually do. Trade. He knows we're being ripped off and I know we're being ripped off. We're being ripped off, big league.
The difference is I'll make unbelievable deals and he doesn't know what to do. He just knows we're being ripped off. But Bernie Sanders, I will say this, for the last five weeks, you turn on the television. Sanders wins. Sanders wins. Again, Sanders wins like seven or eight or nine. He keeps winning. And then you listen to the people and the pundits and they say, he has no chance of winning.
I said, what's going on? Because you have superdelegates -- by the way, I think the Republicans have a worse system than the Democrats but they have superdelegates. It makes it impossible for a guy that wins to win. It's a crooked system, folks. It's a crooked system. It really is a crooked system. You know, again, I don't care who wins over there.
I'll take on either one of them. I sort of had my heart set on Hillary, to be honest with you. And her whole life, remember this, her whole life has been one big lie. It's been one big lie. And you go back and you look at Whitewater and you look at her cattle deal. Remember the cattle, she made the highest percentage practically in the history of cattle making.
I wonder why that happened, folks. But you take a look and now you look at this horrible scandal with e-mails where she's probably being protected, probably being protected because people that did 5% of what she did have had their lives destroyed and her life is just fine. It looks like she'll be the candidate.
And in a certain way, that's really the one I want to run against. We will beat her so badly beat her, we'll beat her badly. You know, when Ronald Reagan -- I mean I've had some nice polls, but when Ronald Reagan -- don't forget I have 17 people coming at me and they said, please, please, darling, my wife and my daughter, Ivanka.
Daddy, please, be more presidential. I said, wait a minute, wait a minute, I got 17 people throwing barbs at me. I got to take him out before I become presidential don't I, right? You know, they mean be nice and we can't be nice until they have -- we have two leftovers right now. We can't be nice, we can't be nice until we win it. And you know, when I first started, Jeb Bush had it made.
He was gonna win. He was presumptive. You know, in Florida, you speak about unfair. I got to tell you, you speak about what's unfair. So in Florida, you had 99 delegates and Jeb Bush had it set. Jeb Bush or Rubio, both of them, they had it set so that the winner takes everything because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything.
And so it was all set. It was set in steel. 99 delegates winner gets all. And then the first poll came out, Trump, 48; Jeb, 16; Rubio, 12. And they said, oh, right? They said, oh, this is terrible. We got to change it. So they made a move to change it. When you get proportion, but it was too late. I said, no way you can do it. We put up a little bit of a ruckus.
But I will say this, so in Florida, it was set. So that I wouldn't get it and it was set winner take all because the governor was gonna get it. The past governor, who is pretty popular. The past governor or the future of the Republican Party, which was Marco, right? Now I wouldn't -- I want to be nice. Marco, only Marco.
No first name. We don't go any -- we don't do that anymore. You know why we don't do it anymore because we won. We don't do it. No, he's going to be Marco, who's a guy -- by the way, who's a nice guy. Marco is actually a nice guy. He went a little Don Rickles on me but then we went heavy Don Rickles back.
But Marco is a nice guy. And I'm sure Jeb is a nice guy. I didn't get to know him too well. He was too busy doing negative ads. The guy spent like $48 million on ads, many of them against me negative ads. But remember they did Florida and you remember the outcry when the first poll came out and I was close to 50 and they were in the teens and they said, wow, what are we going to do? And I ended up winning by 20 points, by 20. We had a -- it was a landslide.
It was a landslide. So you never know about the phony rules and regulations but hopefully, the RNC is gonna get with the people. The RNC hasn't won an important election in a long time. We've had Obama far too long. The last election should have been won except Romney choked like a dog. He choked. He went, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, he said.
Romney choked. I never saw anything -- well, let me tell you, George speech choked a little bit but you know what, he's going to recover. He's a great young guy and he's going to recover. Romney can't recover from a choke. That was an election that should have been won. That was an election that should have been won easily and for the last month he disappeared.
He went into a house and he just disappeared. What the hell happened to him? And so I backed -- who in all fairness had a tough time, I backed Romney. You wouldn't believe this but I actually backed him, raised a lot of money for him and other things and he failed. So McCain failed, Romney felt and I said, this time, we're going to do it ourselves, OK? We're going to do it this way.
So we'll see. But we're doing well. We won the South. In fact, I think I may have to move to the south if New York doesn't treat me great. I won Alabama. Think. Of this. I won -- did you see today, we won Missouri. Today, we won Missouri. We love Missouri. And I was a little worried about Missouri because lying Ted Cruz, his top guy is from Missouri.
So when I won -- that's right, lying Ted. So when I won remember with Ted, he comes with a Bible held high and he talks about the Bible, except the evangelicals like me better than they like Ted Cruz because they know what they get. We're gonna get strong military. We're gonna take care of our vets. We're going to get protect our Second Amendment.
We're going to have strong borders. We're going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something great. They know. They know. By the way -- They know. They know. They know what's gonna happen. They know we know how to win. You know, we know how to win, folks. You know, I saw a couple of the guys that I defeated soundly and they're saying, but he won't do well in the general election.
Well, they said, I wouldn't do well in the primaries too, you know, I mean. Same guy. He won't do well now. I haven't even started on Hillary and my numbers are better right now than Ronald Reagan's numbers were with Jimmy Carter. You know, Ronald Reagan, who was great, he had a 30 favorability and he was behind Jimmy Carter by so much.
Everybody said, oh, this is gonna be a disaster. And Jimmy Carter, now I will say this, the last person that Hillary wants to run against is me. I will tell you that and I know that for a fact. But Jimmy Carter wanted to run against Ronald Reagan. He said, oh please, let Reagan win. And he was so far behind Reagan.
And by the time the election took place, it was a big victory. An easy victory for Reagan. That's what happens. That's what happens because you aim your fire at that person. Now, I've only done it once to Hillary. I've only done it once I was about two months ago, right? And because of that Bernie did well.
I was the best thing that ever happened to Bernie because I hit her and Bill so hard when she used that phony little thing she said. That she went down. He started doing well. He stayed the same. And all of a sudden, Bernie was doing well and I got no credit for it. I took her, took her from here to here and you talk about unfavorable numbers.
So watch what happens once I get rid of the rest, OK? I want to be nice. I want to be presidential. I want to be presidential. It is true though. You know, in the last debate, my daughter came up and she said, Dad, be very, very nice tonight. I said, I can't be nice if somebody hits me. If somebody hits me, I got to hit her back or him back 10 times harder.
She said, no, no, no. And then my wife said, that's right. Be very nice. I said, I can't. And I was nice in the last debate. Now I have to say this, it was by far the most boring debate, but we won that debate. But I was nice. I was proud of myself. I walked off the stage. I said, was that good? But I was bored.
It was very boring. You know, it's more fun to hit back. We've got to hit back. So anyway. So it's been amazing. So I look forward to it. But it is a true story about Ronald Reagan. He went in, he was Jimmy Carter's absolute first pick. And boy, did he do a number. And within a month of that election it looked like Jimmy Carter was going to do OK. And within about two weeks, it was over.
It was over. And when you look at the mistakes that Hillary has made, when you look at the mistakes that Obama has made because basically -- by the way, do you see how nice she is to President Obama? Oh, yes Mr. President. Yes, sir Mr. President. Whatever the president wants is OK with me. Whatever he wants.
You know, she didn't used to be that way with him. In fact, she cannot stand President Obama. She didn't. But now, what does the president want? Well, he wants it. Oh well, I want the same thing. Isn't he a wonderful president? That's Hillary. I wonder why. Does anybody know why? That's right, folks. That's right.
Isn't it amazing how nice she is. She is so nice to the president. Let me tell you, nobody is going to be voting for a third term of Obama. He is a total disaster. He is a disaster. And nobody's voting, nobody is voting for a third term. So that's what I really look forward. I think we're going to do great.
I think we're going to do great in New York. You got to get out and vote next Tuesday. Got to do it. You know, we've had so much press on this movement and people said even last night on Bill O'Reilly, they had Brit Hume, who never says anything good about me. But he actually said, it's a phenomena what's taken place.
He actually said that. I couldn't believe it. No O'Reilly was nice. O'Reilly was nice but he had Brit Hume and Brit Hume, you know, he hasn't been particularly nice, Brit Hume and his sister. These people -- my people. These are my people. These are my people. Sometimes I can't believe it when I hear a foul mouth person like that.
No, but he said, it's a phenomena what's happened. He actually said -- Thank you. Thank you. USA is right. It's gonna be USA. America first, folks. America first right now. But he actually said and he means it. What? I mean he probably doesn't like me but he said, what's happened and what Trump has done is a phenomena.
He said something to the effect that it's probably never happened in the history of this country and it's true. You know, wherever I go, we have crowds like this. We have crowds that 35,000 people in Mobile Alabama. We had 20,000, 24,000 or 25,000 in Oklahoma. We got -- no matter where we go, New Hampshire, which we won in a landslide, South Carolina, landslide.
We won all these states. Many of them we weren't expected to win. You know, we weren't expected to win. See, in those cases, the rules are, OK? Right? Yes. But if we lose one, the rules are no good. No. The rules are no good when you don't get democracy. The rules are no good when they don't count your vote.
When they don't like in Colorado. The rules are no good when you have to play dirty tricks in order to pick up delegates, OK? And I don't think it's going to matter anyway because a guy like Cruz -- don't forget Cruz, don't forget Cruz. Lying Ted, what he did to Ben Carson in Iowa and Ben Carson endorsed me and he's a great guy.
What he did to Ben Carson, what he said Ben Carson has left the race. This was during the election. He's left the race and people are walking into the caucus, which is I don't like caucus. I like frankly an election, you walk in, you vote, you leave, OK? But they walk in and they say, oh Ben has left the race.
Come on, let's talk, let's talk. Thousands and thousands of people were lied to and misled during the election. And you know what, that's dirty stuff and the same things happening right now. The party is playing dirty and we got to show our Republican Party. You've been disenfranchised. Everybody has. You've got to show the Republican Party that they can't get away with this stuff any longer because it's enough.
And we've had enough losses. We've had enough losses with Romney types that are stiffs that can't get elected. He never had a chance. We've had enough of this stuff. We're going to win and we're going to win so big and we're going to bring the country back. And I'm going to take trade deals and I'm going to have jobs come back to our country.
They're not going to Mexico anymore. So much misinformation, though, folks. They lie so much. The press lies so much. I mean, I've had stories that when I started off, his father gave him $200 million. $200 million. In fact, my sister is a federal judge, she said, he did? That's straight. My father gave me great knowledge.
Didn't give me a lot. And later on, he passed, he give me something. But I have brothers and sisters, I started off with $1 million loan and I built it up to more than $10 billion dollars in value. A million dollar loan and I built it up in a relatively short period of time to more than $10 billion. Some of the greatest assets in the world.
You look at Doral. You look at buildings all over the place. You look at Turnberry, the great Turnberry. We have the British Open in Scotland. You look at all of these different places, tremendous cash flow, great iconic assets and very little debt. And I filed my papers with the federal election and the only reason I tell you is that's the kind of thinking we need in our country.
Now, we're getting killed. We have $19 trillion in debt. You know, the other day I was asked on one of the networks. I was asked a very good question, NATO. Now, I know about NATO but I'm not an expert in NATO, but I have a lot of common sense like a lot of the people here. Not all of you, but a lot of you, right?
And they asked me about NATO. First time I think I've ever been asked about NATO. Don't forget, I've only been doing this for nine months, folks. But I'm smart. I'm like a smart person. So they asked me about NATO. What do I think? And I'm saying, well, NATO was set up a long time ago about 68 years ago and it was really set up for the Soviet Union, which doesn't exist.
But Russia is still very powerful, more powerful in a certain way because of the mass weaponry that you have today, more powerful in certain way than ever before. But think of -- and by the way, Russia is building nukes and they're building missiles and they're doing forts all over the place. They're doing military bases and all we're doing is contracting.
We better be damn careful, folks. We better build our military bigger and better and stronger because we are going to be in big, big trouble pretty soon. You know, we're not playing with babies over there. We're going to be in big -- we think ISIS is a problem. Let me tell you. ISIS is peanuts. The first thing we have to do, we have to wipe ISIS the hell out.
We got to wipe them out. But we've got to get back to rebuilding our military because it's being decimated. It's being decimated. We've got to rebuild our military. We've got to take care of our security. You know somebody said, what's the most important job as president? I said, no, I'll give you the three most important jobs: Security, security, security, OK? After that, the economy and jobs and all of that stuff.
But without the security of our country and without having borders, I mean, look, what's happening in our southern border, the crime the drugs. We are going to build the wall. Who's gonna pay for the wall? Better believe it. By the way, by the way, you know, the lying people back there. They think that I kid.
Even these guys that I'm up against. You can't get Mexico to pay for the wall. I said -- that's right. He's right. You cannot get Mexico. I said, let me tell you say something. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion here. That doesn't include all the drugs that come across the country. We get the drugs, the drugs poison our youth and they get the money.
And it just goes back and forth. We get drugs, they get money. That's not even included. And that number is probably bigger. Who the hell knows what that number is. By the way, this week, the Border Patrol, 15,500 unbelievable people endorsed Donald Trump for a reason. And they've never endorsed a candidate for president even before.
And it's not even a good thing for them to do it because, you know, now they'll have repercussions. But they really said, we don't care. He's the only one that gets it. He's the only one that understands. And then you had Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is a fantastic guy, he endorsed Donald Trump. We've had so many great endorsements with Governor Christie and with Sarah Palin and with everybody.
Vander Plaats. Our friend, Bob Vander Plaats, from Liberty University just been -- We have had Ben Carson, I told you. Great. Great. I mean we have -- I'll tell you what. We have such great Jeff sessions. Cruz would get up and he talk about jack of the great. I mean, look, Senator Sessions is so respected in Congress, in the Senate, all over Washington.
And Senator Sessions, Cruz were talking about him. Senator Jeff Sessions said this, Senator Jeff Sessions. Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump. Even I was surprised. All right? I believe he's the man that Ted Cruz, lying Ted respects more than anybody else in the U.S. Senate and he endorsed me. So that's a big endorsement in my book.
So I want to thank him. But, but look, when this all began, folks, it was June 16th -- thank you. I think. When this all began, it was June 16th. I came down the escalators and I talked about borders and I talked about bad trade deals. And we went very rapidly up and from virtually a couple of weeks after I announced till now, we've been number one every single week.
Every single week. And there's a reason for that. And the reason is security. And by the way, nobody respects women more than Donald Trump. Nobody. And we have women's groups all over the country that are forming because they know these liars back there in the media are treating me so unfairly with women.
And the other night on television, the other night was so great. It was on television and there was a woman and she had 10 or 15 friends standing behind her, a wonderful woman. And they said, exact -- you know trying to bring out the bad. What does it take for you not to go with Donald Trump? So that you went against him?
She said, stop your question, stop your question. There's nothing, nothing he can do that would ever make me vote or go against him. And the women behind all said, she said, he's the strongest on the military, he's the strongest on the border. He's gonna give us great spirit as a country. He's gonna bring back our trade and our jobs and our economy.
And there's nothing he can do. Now, I guess, she didn't exactly mean nothing, but she said nothing. And you know what I wanted to do? I wanted to get up and just hug that beautiful television set. I want to kiss that beautiful set. I'd love to find that woman. She was so amazing. But there are many women -- thank you.
Do you agree with her? Do you agree with her? No, it's -- I mean, it's such it's such a false -- I mean, they give you such false information. Look, what we're going to do is, first of all, we're going to take care of women's health issues far better than Hillary is ever going to do it. And we're going to take care of the security of our country.
And nobody's going to do that like me, folks. Nobody's gonna do that with me. Nobody. You know, during one of the debates, Ted Cruz is standing over here, and they said to him -- they asked him a question, which was not something he had polled. So he did not know how to answer it. By the way, he's not a good debater, in my opinion.
I mean, you know, they say, I've won every single debate from the beginning. I don't think he's a good debater. Somebody said, he's a world-class. He's not world-class anything. I can tell you one thing. I don't think he is a good debater, but he doesn't know how to talk. It's always so dramatic, dramatic.
It's called, you know -- some people would say, phony. But they asked Ted Cruz about water boarding. What do you think of waterboarding? And you didn't want -- oh yeah. He didn't want answer it, right? And then he didn't want to answer it. He didn't want to get in because he didn't want to be politically incorrect and all of that, right?
But he didn't want to talk about it and then they asked me, they said, what do you think Mr. Trump? I said, I'm fine with it. I think it's great. But I think we've got to get much tougher than waterboarding. Much tougher. We got to get much, much tougher. We have to stay within the laws. You know, the laws are so bad.
We have laws that don't even allow you to do waterboarding. So think of this, you're ISIS. They eat like you do. They're sitting home eating. They just chopped off 12 heads. They just drowned 100 people and then they're reading that the United States finds water boarding to be cruel and not nice. And anybody that gets caught waterboarding will be punished for life, thrown out of the military, destroyed.
And here they are chopping off heads and drowning people in heavy steel cages. Boom, stays down for one hour and they pull it back up. And they're talking about waterboarding. And you say to yourself, we're in a fight but we're playing by different rules. And that's not a good formula folks for winning. We got to play tougher.
We can't send leaflets down saying, we're going to start bombing you in one hour. It's unbelievable. And who is the one that's been saying for a long time take the oil? And by the way, I said from the beginning, from the beginning I said, don't go into Iraq. You know, they're all saying, oh Trump, maybe he's a tough guy.
Maybe he's too tough. You know, he may be too tough. He'll be too quick with the trigger. I'll be the slowest with a trigger. But here's the difference, nobody's going to mess with us if I'm in charge, OK? I'll be the slowest but nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody. Nobody. We're laughed at all over the world for being stupid people.
We're laughed out all over the world for having really stupid leadership and it's going to end, folks. We're going to make the greatest trade deals in the world. When it comes to defending all these countries that are wealthy, wealthy countries, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia.
They were making a billion dollars a day when the oil was high. Now they're still making a fortune. We defend them. And you know what happens when we ask them for money? They say, no, no. And we -- Oh, OK, OK, maybe we'll talk to you next year. In NATO, many of the countries and they don't write this in the newspapers and the media doesn't discuss it what I said because they said, oh Trump wants to break up NATO.
You always have to be prepared to walk folks if you have a deal. If John Kerry walked from the Iran deal a couple of times, it could have been a much better deal. Instead, we gave $150 billion. We've got nothing in that deal. Nothing. And we should have had our prisoners before we started negotiating. Believe me. But you always have to be prepared.
So we have many, many countries in NATO that are not carrying their weight. They're not spending the money that they agreed to. They're not paying hardly anything. We're defending them, right? We're defending -- we have 28 countries we're defending many of those countries. Most of them aren't paying their weight and it's acknowledged.
And when I said this, some of the experts -- and I said, two things, it's obsolete. Was it obsolete? Because it doesn't really cover terror. And if it does, we have a lot of the wrong countries in there because these aren't terror countries. They do have problems with Soviet Union, now Russia. But these are countries that have problems but not terror.
It's a different kind of a problem. So I said, it's obsolete because terrorist is our problem, right? Now don't you think? I mean terrorist is our problem. Honestly, we have so many problems. We've had such bad leadership. We have problems. You go back 10, 12 years and I'm including other people when I say that.
But you look at where our country was, you look at where our debt was. $19 trillion going to $21 trillion, not billion. We have trillions. Nobody even knows what a trillion is. We have big problems, folks. So when I said, it's obsolete. It doesn't cover terror. That's OK. And a lot of the experts then said, wow, we've never thought of that.
And these are guys that study that. You know why? They're so close to it. Did you ever get so close to a deal or a job that you don't really see it? You don't see the big picture. And they also said it's not fair that we're carrying all these countries. I said that very strongly. We've got it. Now one of the things I do early on and I didn't say get rid of NATO.
But I'm prepared to walk because I'm not gonna let you defend other countries and keep raising your taxes. You're the highest taxed people in the world, in the whole world. And I would go back to these countries, some of whom are very rich, and I would say, you're delinquent like an apartment when somebody is with me. They owe me rent.
I say how many months? Two months, three months. I say you better get it quick, but they're delinquent. You call them delinquent. These countries are delinquent. Now they're delinquent. You know why? Because they think we're stupid. That's why. Why should they pay? So not only do I want the money that they should be paying us currently, but I want the money that they owe us for years and years.
OK? I want it. And then after that, they've got to pay a more fair share and they've got to keep it current. And if they don't, they're gone. And if it doesn't work out folks, we always gotta be prepared to walk, OK? They'll have to defend themselves. You know, you look at the Ukraine, we're always saying we'll fight.
Will this, will that I don't hear any country over there talking about the Ukraine. It's always us talking. We're paying 73% the costs of NATO. You have 28 countries. The United Nations. When was the last time you saw the U.N. -- I built the building right opposite the United Nations, probably destroyed the building's value if they leave.
I don't care. I don't care. I no longer care. I care about this. This is the big picture, folks. This is the big picture. When -- with all of these conflicts all over the world, Syria and Libya. How about Libya? That was a Hillary Clinton disaster. Benghazi, the ambassador. He called her supposedly 600 times and she never responded.
And yet, her friends call her and she responds immediately. How about that phony ad? Who do you want at 3:00 o'clock in the morning answering the phone? She wasn't there at 3:00 o'clock in the morning. And he was killed along with other people that were great people, right? He was killed. And now let me tell you and I'll tell this.
Maybe the press will write it. They'll give somebody else the credit but that's OK. But in Libya, great oil. Do you know it's among the finest oil patches in the world in terms of quality oil. You know who's got that oil now? ISIS. ISIS has the oil. And you know what they are doing with the oil? They're selling the oil all over and ships are pulling in and they're just selling it like crazy and they're making a fortune.
And we don't even set up a blockade and we don't bomb the hell out of those ships. Folks, we are being so stupidly led. We have people that don't have a clue. You know we're all sort of like together, we're smart people. I have the smartest people, I have the most loyal people and even these liars back there will say it, the most loyal people are Trump supporters.
The most loyal people are Trump supporters, by far. Because you know what? We grew up together in New York. You know me. I mean, we all have little things. But you know me, I know you, we all love each other. These other guys, these other guys, when you look at Cruz talking about New York values and the hate.
When you look at the things that they approve, when you look at the things they won't approve where it has to do with New York and then they come in and they want to get your vote, both of them. No. I don't think so, folks. I don't think so. I will tell you something. We are going to cherish and we are going to protect this state.
Our state is going to hell. We are going to cherish and we are going to protect our state. And we're going to bring back jobs to our state and we're going to bring back jobs to our country. We're going to bring them back. So here's the story just to end it. Look, we have a big election coming up. It's a very important election.
A very, very prominent writer journalist called me and said, somebody I do respect, and said, how does it feel? How does it feel, Mr. Trump? I said, what? He said what you've done has never been done, like Brit Hume what he said last night on O'Reilly. What you've done has never been done in the history of American politics.
And I said, I said, no, no, no. No, no, I know it's wonderful. He said -- I said, if I don't win. He said, no, no you don't have to win what you've done. I said, you're wrong. If I don't win, I will consider what I've done a massive waste of time and to my money, not your money because I'm self funding but my money.
A massive waste of time because I'm not looking for accolades in three years when they talk about the various elections. I don't care about that. The only way we're going to turn this country around because all these guys like Cruz and like the senators and like all of them, the politicians, they're all talk and no action.
Nobody knows them better than I do. I know him better than anybody. All of these guys, every single one of them are controlled and they're controlled by special interests and those special interests, in many cases, are adverse to our country. So here's the story. Get out and vote on Tuesday. I will not let you down.
We will win again. We will win, win, win. We're going to make America great again. I love you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Rome, NY",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-rome-ny-april-12-2016
Andy Burnham,United Kingdom,2015-11-08,"When I was given this job, I said I wanted to rethink comprehensive education for the 21st century.
Today I will set out my vision for what that means in practice.
My thinking has been shaped by discussions in Labour’s Schools Policy Review and I am grateful to the experts on the group for their insights, and pleased that we are joined by one of them today – inspirational former primary school head, Richard Gerver.
I would also like to thank Demos and Microsoft for hosting us today, and Mike Baker for agreeing to chair this event.
My experts have told me one clear home truth: for too long, politicians have been labouring under old and out-dated assumptions about education and schools.
Having begun in denial, I am now able to admit they are right.
So, as Secretary of State for Education, I would look to build a school system in England based on three clear principles:
First, where hard work is properly rewarded and all young people have something to aim for beyond school.
Second, where we reach every single child, by judging schools on the difference they make for every individual student – including how far schools stretch the brightest
Third, where learning is made relevant to life today, building the character and qualities young people will need to succeed in 21st century
Reward, reach, relevance – these will be my 3Rs to guide schools reform in the 21st century.
I will seek endorsement for them from Labour’s Annual Conference as part of a report of the schools policy review.
It sounds simple. But, as I want to explain today, a school system that truly lives and breathes these ideas will be different than it is today.
And, if it is to be a reality, it’s the political debate about education that urgently needs to enter the 21st century.
My son starts secondary school in September.
Last week, we attended the induction evening with other parents.
The head began by asking us not to judge what we were about to hear by our own time at school.
Schools today were preparing young people for a very different world than the 1980s, he said.
Our sons and daughters could expect to have at least 10 different jobs throughout their career.
Unlike their grandparents, who did specific jobs in large industries, they will most likely work in smaller companies. They will need to be all-rounders, able to adapt quickly to new situations.
It is more likely that they will be employers as well as employees.
With all this in mind, he said, thinking only about exam results would be to miss the point.
Facts and content are not all that matters as some of our children will work in industries we don’t yet know about.
Success in the 21st century will depend on young people’s ability to be resourceful, adaptable, self-confident, creative and self-managing.
Good presentation and people skills will be essential, as will critical thinking.
As I sat listening to this, I was struck by two things: first, how it echoed what I had been hearing from my experts on the policy review; second, how I wished I could get him before the House of Commons to make this speech.
Most MPs, myself included, base their views on education on their own school days and what life was like in the 60s, 70s or 80s.
As the outside changes rapidly, schools remain frozen in time in the minds of most MPs.
But, since the Election, it’s got worse.
Under the Coalition, thin king about education has headed backwards at breakneck speed – following the script of a 1980s film.
You may remember it. It starred a man called Michael, who was trapped in the 1950s.
Back to the Future probably would have been a better title for Michael Gove’s White Paper.
Learning facts by rote to pass exams – names of rivers, Kings and Queens – is relentlessly promoted above instilling the essential qualities young people will need to navigate the modern world.
It’s hard to understand the thought process that can conclude that the way forward for England’s schools in the 21st century is to bring in a new ‘gold standard’ measurement system that values Latin and Ancient Greek above Engineering, Business Studies or ICT.
And, in a world of work that gets more complicated by the day, what do ministers do?
They drop the requirement for work-related learning at Key Stage 4 and allow the Careers Service to melt away before our eyes.
It’s a wholly inadequate response.
By setting out an alternative vision today, I hope to refocus the education debate away from the Government’s obsession with structural reform and back on more fundamental questions.
What are schools for? What do employers want from them?
This is where I start from.
Employability is important, but it’s not all that matters. Schools have to be about values and citizenship too.
Somewhere along the line, as well as being stuck in the past, politicians have lost this broad view of education.
Schools should build strong and prosperous communities in which all young people are ready and able to fulfil their potential – as citizens, employees, employers, mums, dads, carers and neighbours.
This is my answer to the question ‘What are schools for?’
But I don’t know what the Government thinks.
Instead, we see a blizzard of activity focused on changing school structures without any clear vision of what makes the 21st century school.
The Government urgently needs to correct this and to show how its structural reforms will deliver its vision.
Failure to do that risks making its own reform programme an irrelevant sideshow: change for its own sake, a numbers game, rather than focusing schools on the job in hand of rising to the big economic and social challenges of this century.
I am optimistic about our future, but right now our schools look stuck in the last century and government changes are sending them backwards not forwards.
If current policy stays unchanged, I have great fears for where we’ll be in 10 years time.
The lethal combination of the narrow English Baccalaureate and a free-for-all in schools risks cementing an impression that has been building for the last 20 years: a production-line approach to education where schools are stressed-out exam factories teaching to regurgitate facts u nder pressure rather building rounded characters.
Schools have no choice but to focus on what they’re told.
As the Secretary of State told the Commons yesterday, there has been an increase in the number of young people learning Latin in state schools.
I’m not sure it’s the cause for celebration he seems to think it is.
I have nothing at all against bright young people choosing Latin at GCSE. But what I suspect is happening is that schools are steering children towards EBacc subjects and the effect of this is that it is limiting choices for all children within the school.
But I certainly can’t celebrate a system that encourages a focus on the top 30% of students at the expense of the rest.
It leads me to ask: What has this Government got against creativity? What have they got to say to the 70% of children who are unlikely to opt for EBacc subjects?
I think it’s inevitable that the effect will be a school system that sift s into two levels – schools that do well under EBacc and those that don’t.
This risks taking us back to the 1950s: a two-tier system where technical or practical is second-best, our education system is divided, and a generation of children failed.
England urgently needs an alternative to this out-dated thinking.
We need an education policy that is both forward-looking and reasserts the broad view of education.
So here are my emerging ideas about how to build a school system based around the three principles I mentioned at the beginning.
First, a system where hard work is properly rewarded, by giving all young people something to aim for – building on our success in expanding university and apprenticeship places.
The education debate in England urgently needs to be re-balanced.
As Demos has rightly identified, politicians of all parties over a long period of time have let down the 50% or more of young people not planning to go to university.
Because most went to university, there is a tendency to think exclusively about A Levels and the university route, exams and qualifications.
Our school system has traditionally provided great clarity to young people on university route, as to what they need to do to secure a place.
Young people outside that route have had nothing like the same clarity and have been expected to make their own way.
Unless that changes, our school system will continue to cater for some children, not all children. We won’t rise to the big challenges of this century, which are different to the last.
When we started school, our generation had more certainty and structure.
On the whole, people knew university was a realistic possibility – and affordable – if they met the required standard.
For those planning to enter work, trainee schemes operated by large industries were in much more plentiful supply. Entry requirements for them were well understood.
Today, there is still clarity about what it takes to go to University – even if that is a receding possibility for many young people.
But, with the demise of large industry, there is nowhere near as much clarity for young people who want to get good vocational qualifications that will take them towards skilled work.
And this problem will only get bigger, as young people switch off from higher education.
I think this is taking the country in the wrong direction, as university education gives people the all-round versatility and confidence they will need for the modern world.
But, if we are to avoid a lost generation, we must urgently rethink what we are offering as a society to young people not planning to go to university.
When they start school, all young people need to feel they have something to aim for.
If they don’t have a clear sense that school needs is leading somewhere and giving them a path in life, the risk will be that we see young people switching off at school in greater numbers as the EBacc is not what they want and other courses will have the distinct feel of being second-best, an afterthought.
So what to do?
I want all young people to have a solid opportunity to aim for at 18 – be it a University place or apprenticeship.
But, if we want to instil the right values in our young people, it can’t be about handing everything on a plate.
So I believe this points to developing a new social contract with young people.
When starting school, the message to all young people should be clear: if you put in the hours, and if you meet the required standard, you will gain a solid, prestigious qualification which will open up a good opportunity for you beyond school.
This means we will need good-quality apprenticeships in much more plentiful supply than there are today, and much clearer information and structure for how they access them.
For instance, why isn’t there as much clarity over applying for apprenticeships as there is for applying to universities?
Could we build up the system John Denham introduced into a true UCAS-style system where the best opportunities go to those who work hardest?
Delivering this change will be about building on what we did in Government, but taking it to a new level.
Labour saved apprenticeships from near-extinction.
We more than quadrupled the number of places in our 13 years in government and had plans for further big expansions of public sector apprenticeships.
If the path towards an apprenticeship was as clear as the path towards university, more young people would see the relevance of their education and understand that hard work would be rewarded.
This is why the current shambles around the careers service is so damaging. The school and college leaders’ union, ASCL have said that 2 million young people could mi ss out on careers advice due to government mismanagement.
A social contract for young children of the kind I am talking about will be essential to preventing the terrifying prospect of lost generations throughout this century.
But it will also build a society based on the right values.
In the eyes of the public, Labour in government started to lose an association with hard work and the idea that the way to get on in life is to put in the hours.
At times, we created an impression that opportunities would be provided regardless of people’s willingness to grab them.
A society based on responsibility means firmly planting at the heart of our school system the idea that hard work will be rewarded.
This takes me to my second principle – a school system that reaches every single child, where there is an incentive to stretch every child.
Labour made huge progress at every stage of children’s development.
Sure Start brought a whole-family approach to education and helped bring children to primary school ready to learn.
Primary schools were our great success story. But it’s from 11 to 19 that the picture is more mixed.
I’ve been reflecting on what we got right and wrong.
In 1997, inheriting a system with 50% of schools failing to give a third of kids basic standards in English and maths meant we needed to get a pretty firm grip at the centre.
Our National Challenge benchmark of 5 A*-C at GCSE was the right measure for the time and helped us to turn around over 1,000 failing schools.
But sticking with it for as long as we did brought two problems with it: first, it judged schools by how well they did with some children, not all children; second, it did not provide sufficient incentive to stretch the brightest, to turn Cs in Bs, Bs into As, and As into A*s.
The new Government has made great play of the fact that it is continuing Labour’s approach – but with added fervour and intensity.
This is a debatable claim. But it is true to the extent that the current Government are now in grave danger of cementing into the system some of the flaws in Labour’s approach.
I believe there will always be a need for some measure of absolute standards in our schools.
But in Government we were beginning to move away from 5A*-Cs as a headline measure, because we knew that any ‘threshold’ standard like this would focus attention at the borderline and not incentivise schools to focus on every child.
We can’t turn off the flow of data, and the more information we have about our schools, the better. But we can control how politicians handle and react to that data.
By making the English Bacc their headline performance measure for schools the Government has ensured that turning grade Ds into Cs will remain a core focus for schools.
Having promised to end top-down targets, schools are being plac ed in a vice-like grip – not just the EBacc but also a tougher 5 A to Cs floor target.
Labour’s policy review is looking at whether it is possible to reform league tables so that schools are judged by the difference that they make with each individual learner.
We will now do further work on developing a simple measure –using CVA or VA as a starting point – that is well understood, trusted by parents and supported by the profession.
If we get it right, it could align the political imperative to measure how schools are doing with the professional vocation of teachers to make a difference for every child.
It would be a simple expression of what should be the mission of every school: pushing every pupil to be the best they can be, with a clear incentive to put no limits on how far we stretch the brightest.
But we will only do that if we also enact my third principle and create a system where learning is made relevant to life today, building t he character and qualities young people will need to succeed in 21st century.
Schools need to give young people need relevant answers to the challenges in their lives.
They need forward-looking courses of study, with links to the world of world, that don’t just focus on facts and knowledge but instil the essential qualities they will need to get on in a changing world.
Relevance is an important concept in education – but not one that features in current Ministerial thinking.
We mustn’t trap ourselves in the out-dated thinking that learning falls into clear categories: the academic or vocational, the theoretical or the practical, the brain or the hands.
Many subjects, like medicine or engineering, are a mixture of both.
We can both stretch young people academically – for example, by offering triple science at GCSE – whilst also promoting practical or vocational learning, like the Engineering Diploma. It’s not a choice between the two, as the Government seems to suggest.
Employers and universities are united and clear in what they want from schools – young people strong in the basics and displaying what they call ‘employability skills’ – like self-management, team working and problem solving.
And they want to see more young people with specialist knowledge in science, technology, maths and engineering.
So it follows that we need a school system that instils those essential qualities, builds strong characters and encourages independent learning.
It is clear that a content-driven curriculum alone will not develop the attributes that employers and universities say they are looking for.
We need to look at how we ensure all young people have the opportunity to develop the knowledge and attributes they need for the modern world.
I think we need to look at two areas first.
First, is there a case for setting out a minimum entitlement for all children – a binding statement of rights in a world where the education system is more fragmented and some schools narrow their focus?
It could build on our pupil and parent guarantees, scrapped by this Government.
Like the right to one-to-one catch-up if a child fell behind in the basics.
Like the opportunity to study triple science at GCSE, or to learn a language at primary school.
Increasing the life chances of children from poorer families in a century where social networks and family connections are becoming more important means giving them access to the same breadth of opportunities as children from better-off families that broaden horizons.
It’s not just about academic opportunities. There is a real fear that sport, cultural opportunities and work experience become random again and the preserve of those whose families can organise opportunities.
These are the things that develop confidence and character.
In my view, every child should have the chance to experience qualified coaching and competitive opportunities in a range of sports.
Just as I would like to see every child experience a creative and cultural education – with opportunities to learn a musical instrument, to act in a play, to develop confidence in public speaking.
Sport and arts are the things that can turn on a light inside many children, helping them achieve more in their core academic studies.
And if we are truly to raise aspirations for every child, we need to be far more ambitious about work-related learning.
Employers have a right to say that schools are turning out young people lacking in the skills they are looking for.
But they also have a responsibility to get involved in schools and help them develop those skills.
Experience of the workplace is essential if we are to broaden the horizons of our most deprived children.
We know that when young people organise their own work experience, a form of social reproduction takes place and they end up experiencing the type of work their families are involved in.
You don’t often find working class kids spending two weeks in a law firm if they have to organise it through their own connections.
Rather than scrapping the requirement, we should have a much more ambitious view where the worlds of law, finance, media and politics are opened up to young people from less well-connected families.
Third sector organisations like Future First and the Education and Employers Taskforce are helping schools to build the networks that they need to offer these opportunities in their local communities.
But minimum entitlements alone will not be enough. We also need a radical rethink of the 14-19 curriculum so that we can give young people a relevant and engaging path from school to work.
Looking back, Labour missed a moment in 2006, with the publication of the Tomlinson Report.
We had a chance to reshape the curriculum and the work of schools – relevant, rewarding, built around the strengths and interests of every child – but failed to take it.
I want to go back to the principles of that report but update it too.
We stand a better chance of engaging all young people if we can offer them relevant options at 14.
English and maths must always be at the core of a young person’s education, and no one should be forced to specialise before they are ready. But they should be able to if they are.
Last week, I visited the JCB Academy and saw students following a programme of study that they had chosen – and that they clearly found highly relevant and engaging.
The Engineering Diploma that JCB Academy offers mixes high quality academic and practical learning, and can help open the doors to apprenticeships and university.
But, importantly, it doesn’t close any doors – the head teacher told me that if, at 16, one of their students decided they wanted to study medicine, there would be no reason why they couldn’t. The school will score zero on the English Baccalaureate.
Instead of closing down their choices, as the English Baccalaureate does, I think we should open them up – so young people can follow the pathway that is right for them and develop their talents, be those are academic, technical, linguistic or creative.
I think we need to look at introducing a true Baccalaureate, like the International Baccalaureate: a broad programme of learning that lets all young people choose the path that suits them best but gives all the solid, prestigious qualification age 14-19 that is valued by employers and universities that I was talking about earlier.
If we are to do this successfully, it will demand more of our teachers.
Standing in front of a class and teaching kids to memorise facts isn’t easy.
But it might seem more straightforward than developing a relevant programme of study that speaks to every child and equips them with not only the knowledge, but also the essential attributes, they will need to succeed in the modern world.
Luckily, we currently have the best generation of teachers ever. I want to make it a national mission in the coming decade to build the best teaching workforce in the world.
That’s why I am asking if there’s a case for working towards making teaching a masters-level profession, following the example of the best school systems around the world.
Only with the highest-quality, most professional teaching workforce in the world will we be able to deliver an education system that rewards hard work, reaches every child and is relevant to the modern world.
This emphasis on access to CPD for teachers could be linked to the introduction of a professionally-led licence to teach.
A more relevant 14 to 19 curriculum will also mean changes for our schools.
I want to see every local area develop exciting and engaging new post-14 pathways, working with employers and post-16 providers.
The implication of this is two major changes from current policy: first, a continuing and important planning role for the local authority in education; second, an education system where collaboration between schools, rather than hand-to-hand combat, is the driving force.
Education is essentially a collaborative activity: the more people share thoughts and ideas, the more they learn. But the market model doesn’t recognise this: it encourages schools jealously to guard the best of what they’ve got; and will produce winners and losers, where young people get trapped in struggling institutions.
My vision is to open up the best that every area has to offer to all children.
A refocused 14-19 curriculum might also mean at 14 that we spend more time bringing the very brightest children together from schools a cross a local authority area, so they can learn from each other and we can give them a clearer idea of what is required on the Russell Group or Oxbridge path.
A system that is “comprehensive and collaborative”: not a rose-tinted view of education but, according to PISA, the defining characteristics of the world’s best education systems.It is about facing future challenges, not a vision of education stuck in the past.
It is about instilling essential qualities rather than focusing solely on facts and exams.
It is about finding a route through for every child, not just the top 25%.
If we don’t do these things, we are facing a century when there is a real risk that social mobility will go seriously into reverse.
The British Promise that Ed Miliband has spoken of – where children have greater life chances than their parents – will only be a reality if we can bring our schools into the 21st century.
Preventing a lost generation and wasting the talents of our young people is one of the great challenges of our times.
As university gets more expensive, EMA withdrawn, and old structures break down, it will be those kids without connections, and family networks, who fail to get on.
I came into politics to challenge that.
And its why today I put forward my vision for comprehensive education in the 21st century: relevant, rewarding, aspirational for all.
",2011 Speech to Demos,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/andy-burnham-2011-speech-to-demos/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-02-12,"Hello, everybody. Thank you. Hi, Steve. So, maybe we can begin. I'll ask Secretary Wilkie to say grace, please.
Thank you very much, Secretary. Beautiful. Thank you all for being here. Before we begin, we're thinking about certain things that we're just starting to look at. David Bernhardt is, as you know, going through the process -- becoming Secretary of Interior, from Acting. He's done a fantastic job. And I think it will continue, and we look forward to that.
We're thinking about doing, on the 4th of July or thereabouts, a parade. A ""Salute to America"" parade. It will be a -- really, a gathering, as opposed to a parade, I'd guess you'd have to say. Perhaps at the Lincoln Memorial. We're looking at sites. But we're thinking about doing something, which would become, perhaps, a tradition.
Salute to America on July 4th or July 4th weekend. Somewhere around that area. And, David, you're taking charge of that and you'll see how it works out with schedules and everything else. And I think it could be a very exciting day. And the fireworks is there anyway, so we just saved on fireworks.
We get free fireworks because it's already being done. So, good morning and welcome to our Cabinet meeting. As I said in my State of the Union Address, I'm eager to work with both parties to deliver for all Americans. That's what we have to start doing. There's tremendous and quite unusual attitude on the other side.
There's a lot of anger. And they're slipping extremely far left. And we don't want that to happen to our country. So we're working very hard with the other side, and hopefully positive things can take place. Since the election, we've created 5.3 million jobs, including more than 300,000 last month alone.
Blue-collar jobs have grown at their fastest pace in more than 30 years. And we've added half a million manufacturing jobs. That number is going to very soon be 600,009 because of certain things that are happening. And economic growth has nearly doubled since I took office. We have a big team over in China right now, and they're working very hard, dealing with the Chinese.
We want very much to make a deal. We'll see what happens. But the tariffs are bringing a tremendous amount of money to our Treasury. And as you read, of the 21 points -- and actually, the number would be 25 now, on the areas that are taxed at 25. China is paying for 21, and we're paying for 4. So that's pretty good.
But we're bringing billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury right now. We'll see what happens, but they very much want to make a deal. Their economy has been hurt by the tariffs. And our economy is thriving like, really, never before. I mean, we're doing incredibly well. We have a lot of companies going to be announcing.
They've already announced, in some cases -- and in many cases, they have announced -- they're moving back into the country. They want to be a part of the United States. It's like a miracle in the United States, what's happening. But we have a lot of companies that have left. In many cases, they left our country and they're moving back.
And that means a lot of jobs. Speaking of jobs, we have to have more people coming into our country because our real number is about 3.6, 3.7. It took a little blip up during the shutdown and went up to 4. And 4 -- any country would take a 4. But we're about 3.7; probably going lower. We need people. So we want to have people come into our country, but we want to have them come in through a merit system, and we want to have them come in legally.
And that's going to be happening. We're doing very well in that regard. But we have tremendous numbers of companies. And you've been reporting on them. A lot of car companies are coming back to the United States. We want to keep the job boom going strong, and we must protect our economy. And we have to protect it from any attempts to impose socialism.
Socialism does not work too well. And we don't want that as part of our country and as part of our heritage. We just can't have it. Everything would come to an end -- and rapidly. And then, all of a sudden, you'd see things happening and you'd say, ""What's going on? Whatever happened?"" But we're at a high point today, and we're going to go a lot higher.
We have a long way to go, frankly, as far as I'm concerned -- especially where we make the good trade deals and make the good military deals. As an example, as you know, South Korea -- we defend them and lose a tremendous amount of money. Billions of dollars a year defending them. They agreed, at my request.
And working with Secretary Pompeo and John Bolton, they agreed to pay, yesterday, $500 million more toward their defense. Five-hundred million, with a couple of phone calls. I said, ""Why didn't you do this before?"" They said, ""Nobody asked."" So -- it's got to go up. It's got to go up. Right now, it costs us $5 billion a year to defend.
As an example, South Korea -- we have a great relationship, and with President Moon. And we're doing great things. And North Korea is coming along. South Korea is just an example. But South Korea is costing us $5 billion a year. And they pay -- they were paying about $500 million for $5 billion worth of protection.
And we have to do better than that. So they've agreed to pay $500 million more. And over the years, it will start going up, and they will be terrific. And they've been very good. We've had a really strong -- we made a new trade deal with South Korea. And the same thing will go with Japan. And the same thing will go with Saudi Arabia and many others.
I mean, we protect Saudi Arabia. They've got nothing but cash. And we protect them with great subsidy. We give Saudi Arabia subsidy. Should be the other way around, as far as I'm concerned, right? So a lot of things are happening. And all of this endures to the strength of our country and to our economy.
And so we're looking forward to seeing that. The Mexico deal -- as you know, Mexico/Canada trade deal, the USMCA is a tremendous deal. But one of the things -- because NAFTA was one of the worst deals in the history of this country ever signed. It cleaned out our jobs and our company. It was just a terrible, terrible thing that we signed NAFTA. So this is the NAFTA replacement.
It has nothing to do with NAFTA. And one of the things that make it very hard -- it's very hard for a company, financially, to leave our country, under the USMCA. Very, very prohibitive to leave. And that was the thing I wanted more than any other element. I said, ""I don't want these companies going and leaving, and going to Mexico and Canada."" They've got their own companies.
I don't want to do that. We lost tremendous -- we lost 25 percent of our automobile industry to Mexico. We lost 30 percent to a combination of both Canada and Mexico. So that's wielding its way through, and I guess it's hitting Congress very shortly, and we'll see how that does. But that's a great deal.
And it's a very labor-friendly deal. It's a deal that the workers of our country will love. One in three women, as you know, are sexually assaulted on the long journey north. We want to stop that. We want to stop those journeys. The way you do that is with barrier security, a wall. And we're making a lot of progress.
In fact, I noticed yesterday, when I got to El Paso, they had signs, ""Finish the Wall,"" instead of ""Build the Wall."" Because we're doing a lot of wall right now. Just started a big portion of the wall in the Rio Grande Valley, which is now the biggest area for people coming in. We've sealed up a lot of the areas where people come in. But they're looking for the soft spots, and they come up in a caravan and they look for the areas without any barrier.
And that's why they like to come in. And we grab them, and it's a very tough situation. We could save billions and billions of dollars in cost and hundreds of billions of dollars in drugs and what they're doing to us with drugs. And so much of it comes through. And don't believe people when they say it all comes through the portals; it doesn't -- the ports of entry.
It comes through -- the big loads come through the border, where you don't have wall, where they can drive a truck, a big truck, loaded up with drugs or loaded up with this thing called a ""human cargo."" Human cargo. These are traffickers. These are the worst people on Earth. And they don't come through the ports of entry with people in the back of a car tied up. Could never do that.
They come through areas where there's no barrier. So we'll see what happens. I got reports last night, when I was going out to speak. We had, by the way, a massive crowd. And my competitor had very few people, but the press didn't report it that way. The press reported it like two speeches. We had a competitor that decided to challenge me with the crowds.
And he failed very badly. From what I hear, he had less than a thousand people. And we had a packed arena, and we had probably 25,000 people outside of the arena. It was an incredible night in Texas, I can tell you that. It was really amazing. But as I'm going on stage to speak, they're telling me about the committee came out with a deal.
And, you know, they went over it very briefly. Then I went over it briefly last night, but it was 3 o'clock in the morning. And I can't say I'm happy. I can't say I'm thrilled. But the wall is getting built, regardless. It doesn't matter. Because we're doing other things beyond what we're talking about here.
So we'll see what happens. We're having a meeting on it later. It's really obstruction. The Democrats want everybody to be able to come into our country. We have many criminals. When you look at the numbers of criminals that are nabbed -- I mean, I'm looking at numbers that are incredible. This card was just given to me by Secretary Nielsen.
And -- assaults: 99,000 assaults. Larceny: 40,000. Burglary: 25,000. Fraudulent activities: 25,000. Damage and stolen property: 17,000. Sex offenses: 13,552. Sexual assaults: 10,468. That's sexual assaults on people that live in our country by people that are coming illegally across our borders. In many cases, people that have come before I became -- before I became President.
What happens is we are working very hard. We're getting rid of tremendous numbers of MS-13. And the Democrats don't like us to get rid of MS-13. Now, you figure that one out. These are violent people, and they don't like us to get rid of MS-13. So, robberies: 11,177. Kidnappings: 4,112. Murders: 3,914. Okay?
So these are people that ICE is dealing with, and nobody can deal with them more effectively. There's probably no group in this country that does so much and gets, really, so little respect or love as ICE. It's really a terrible thing. They're doing an incredible job. One other thing I might want to say is that anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress.
And Congressman Omar is terrible, what she said. And I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. What she said is so deep-seated in her heart that her lame apology -- and that's what it was; it was lame, and she didn't mean a word of it -- was just not appropriate.
I think she should resign from Congress, frankly. But at a minimum, she shouldn't be on committees, and certainly that committee. And with that, we're going to have a meeting. Our Cabinet is doing really well. I'll tell you, we're doing great. Our country is doing great. The stock market is up tremendously today.
Of course, I haven't seen it in 15 minutes, so, you know, anything is -- Larry Kudlow, anything is subject to change, right? But so far, so good. And we're hitting new records with growth. We're hitting new records with the economy. We've hit many new records on unemployment. More people working today in the United States than at any time in the history of our country.
We're getting very close to 160 million people. And we've never had anything like that, which tells you that we have to have people come into our country -- great people, from the areas that we're talking about. But we want them to be productive, and they -- we want people that are going to love our country and help our country.
So I want to thank our Cabinet. The Cabinet is doing a fantastic job. Really, unsung job. Because members of this Cabinet, there are those people that say this is one of the best Cabinets this country has ever had. I happen to agree. I happen to agree. We have great, great people in our Cabinet. And I want to thank you all very much for doing a fantastic job.
Thank you very much. And, Matt, I guess, maybe at some point there will be a vote, and --
-- maybe at some point you won't be doing what you're doing. Come here. I think you've done -- you've taken a tremendous amount of abuse. You handled yourself incredibly last Friday. But on behalf of all of us, I want to thank you very much. Matt Whitaker. Okay, thank you all very much.
I have to study it. I'm not happy about it. It's not doing the trick. But I'm adding things to it. And when you add whatever I have to add, it's all going to happen where we're going to build a beautiful, big, strong wall that's not going to let criminals and traffickers and drug dealers and drugs into our country.
It's very simple. It's very simple. We're building a wall. And now I'm saying we're finishing the wall. We just started a big, big section on the Rio Grande. You probably saw it. Some of you were there when they started. You went there; you didn't believe it. You went there, and you see trucks all over the place.
You said, ""Hey, he's not kidding."" I don't kid. I never kid about construction. I love construction. And we're getting a beautiful-looking structure that's also less expensive to build and works much better. That's a good combination of events, because it was crazy what they were putting up. In fact, I happen to think that the walls that they were building were so unattractive and so ugly that walls got bad names.
Okay? If that means anything. But they were so ugly, with rusted steel and big ugly plates on top that were all tin-canned. It's called tin-canned, where they're wavy, because the heat makes them expand and contract, and they're tin-canned. I said, ""Why didn't you paint the steel?"" ""Well, sir, we save money by not painting."" And I said, ""Yeah, but it's going to rust.
You have to paint."" I've never seen -- I've ordered a lot of steel -- I've never seen, in my whole life, steel come to me that was unpainted. This can only happen at the border. It wasn't me; it was our past geniuses. So, I can tell you that, am I happy at first glance? I just got to see it. The answer is no, I'm not.
I'm not happy. But am I happy with where we're going? I'm thrilled because we're supplementing things and moving things around. And we're doing things that are fantastic and taking from far less -- really, from far less important areas. And the bottom line is we're building a lot of wall. Right now, we're building a lot of wall.
And you think it's easy? We're building in the face of tremendous obstruction and tremendous opposition from a small group of people. And one thing that happened that was, I think, very revealing -- we had the biggest and best border agents and experts come up and see the committee. And they said, more than anything else, ""You need a barrier.
You need a wall."" And the recommendation was unacceptable to the committee. So that tells you more than anything else.
I don't think you're going to see a shutdown. I wouldn't want to go to it, no. If you did have it, it's the Democrats' fault. And I accepted the first one, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished because people learned during that shutdown all about the problems coming in from the southern border. I accept -- I've always accepted it. But this one I would never accept if it happens, but I don't think it's going to happen.
But this would be totally on the Democrats. Okay?
It's always nice to negotiate a little bit, right? So, you know, whatever you get. But I would hope that there won't be a shutdown. I am extremely unhappy with what the Democrats have given us. It's sad. It's sad. They're doing the country no favor. They are hurting our country very badly. But we certainly don't want to see a shutdown.
But you'll be hearing fairly soon. The bottom line is -- on the wall -- we're building the wall. And we're using other methods, other than this and in addition to this. We have a lot of things going. We have a lot of money in this country, and we're using some of that money -- a small percentage of that money -- to build the wall, which we desperately need.
Not at this moment. We have our people over there now. I just got a report. Things are going well with China. China wants to make a deal very badly. I want it to be a real deal, not just a deal that makes -- you know, cosmetically looks good for a year. We have a chance to really make a deal -- a real deal with China.
We've never been in this position before. We've always been the lame duck. And we're not the lame duck anymore. And we've gone up tremendously in value as a country, in economic value. Tremendously. Larry, we've gone up what -- $11 trillion, $14 trillion? And China has gone down close to $20 trillion since we've started this whole --
Say it?
Has anybody ever heard of Larry Kudlow. I hear that voice, and you think money. Right, Larry.
So, I didn't even know that. That's -- China, he said, has the worst performing stock market right now in the world. And we don't want that. We want China to do -- but -- and that's because of us. And we're -- have to be one of the best performing stock markets, but we are the best performing country and we have a lot of potential for further growth.
So we're doing very well over in China. Our people are there. You know the people very well. And I think we're going to have some good answers. I think -- either way, I'm happy. I'm happy either way. I could live receiving billions and billions of dollars a month from China. China never gave us 10 cents.
It was always the opposite way. Now they're paying billions of dollars a month for the privilege of coming into the United States and, honestly, taking advantage of our country. So we'll see how it works out. But at some point, I expect to meet with President Xi -- who I have a lot of respect for and like a lot -- and make the parts of the deal that the group is unable to make.
That's the way deals happen.
Well, thus far, I've said -- as you know, the tariffs tick up for us. In other words, we take in much more money because the tariff -- and there's nothing they can do that's comparable, so it's not like tit for tat. The tariffs kick in; they go up. Right now, they're paying -- they're paying 25 percent on $50 billion.
Okay? And they are paying 10 percent on $200 billion. So we have $250 billion. We have $267 billion that we were very nice about and we're not taxing. On the $200 billion, we're paying the 10 percent. The 10 percent on $200 billion goes up to 25 percent on March 1st. And so far, I've said don't do that.
Now, if we're close to a deal where we think we can make a real deal, and it's going to get done, I could see myself letting that slide for a little while. But generally speaking, I'm not inclined to do that. Okay?
I consider everything. I'm considering everything. You know, we already have national emergencies out there. You know, President Obama, President Clinton, President Bush -- they've declared many national -- this is not unique. They've declared many national emergencies. Many, many. And you have some out there that we can use in addition to one that we can declare if we want to do it. Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you. Thank you.
No. No, I wasn't.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Cabinet Meeting at The White House,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-cabinet-meeting-february-12-2019
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-02-19,"Thank you very much. Do you know how many people are outside? Do you know what's going on out there? You know how lucky you are? You're lucky not to have it, but boy are you lucky anyway. Just to be here. Oh, you're the club champion, congratulate -- I'm a club champion. I mean, many times, club champion, would anybody believe that?
You know what it means? You can handle pressure. Don't kid yourself. You know, to be a club champion, it takes a special something, right? You know, no strokes, he's talking about no strokes. Not these guys that say, I'm a club champion, they've got 10 handicap, right? Cuts a -- so what's your handicap?
Eight, that's pretty high, but that's not bad. That's not bad. And you beat people that are lower, I'll bet, right? Very good. Congratulations. So yeah, there's a tremendous crowd of people outside. Unbelievable and it's great to be with you all. We're going to do something. See that hat Make America Great Again.
That's what we're going to do. We're going to Make America Great Again. And I just want to thank you. This is a beautiful part of the world by the way. This is a beautiful club, too. How many people are members here, a lot of you? Yeah, it's beautiful. I like it. Maybe we should buy it. I don't know. Should we buy it.
So I thought we'd go and maybe we'll do a few question and answer. We'll do a little bit of talking. You've heard a lot of what I have to say. But you know, it started this -- yeah, sit down. Do you have seats? Yes, thank you. Better, right.
We started on June 16th and everybody said, oh, he'll never run. All these pundits, you know, these total morons, like Karl Rove and people that don't, that don't -- they don't even have a clue. And they said, well, he'll never run. And if he runs, he'll just have a good time and he's not going to do it because why would he want to do it. And you know, he built a great business, why would he want to leave that?
I want to do it because we are going to Make America Great Again. We are in such trouble as a country. We owe $19 trillion. We have wars that we can't win. We can't beat ISIS. Can you imagine General MacArthur saying we can't beat ISIS? He'd have ISIS wiped out in about a half a day. So we're going to do something that, you know, the Time Magazine last week, you probably saw -- it's like, it's a movement.
They said it's a movement. It was the cover of Time Magazine and they've been very nice. They put me on the cover all the time. I've had so many -- I never had so many covers on Time. All my life, I think, I was run twice now, I'm on all the time. But we have a movement going. It's a really -- I have to get used to it. No, it's always an honor.
But, but the last story was so good. It's such a great writer and talked about it as a movement and I mean, you see it in here. This room is full. But why are these three seats empty, huh? Who's seats are they? There is -- somebody sit there. I hate to see an empty seat. Somebody sit over there. I'll go ahead, but great Al, one of the great vets of the country.
Somebody sit there, right? I never like to see empty seats. There's never an empty seat for Trump, right? Because it's representing what we're doing, it's representing the movement. But there is, there's a movement going on that's incredible. And no matter where we go, we have 25,000; 35,000 people. More than that, we have 20,000 people in Oklahoma twice, and New Hampshire we had a tremendous victory last week in New Hampshire.
And hopefully, you folks are going to go out and vote on Saturday, and some of you have probably voted already, have you voted? Anybody? A lot of people have voted already. They could vote -- thank you. You voted, yes? Thank you. Otherwise, I'd say get out of this room. But, but things are happening that's amazing.
And I think, we're hopefully -- we're going to do very well tomorrow. We just had the Emmerson poll, Emerson's a great, great poll. And one of the most accurate. I think they were the ones that got it really right last time or the last two times. And the Emerson poll, we just got great numbers with -- for South Carolina, and they really did a great job last time.
So we're honored to have that. We were at 35 or 36, and I think, second was 19 or 18. We had a big, big, big lead, but you know, we just assume we're tied because it's much better to -- Right? As young guys, you have to always assume you're tied. In fact, assume you're down, that's even better, right? We assume we're down and the -- but we have to get out and vote because if we don't get out and vote, there's no movement, there's no anything.
So when it started, it started as trade because it used to drive me absolutely crazy to watch these incompetent, stupid deals where China would consistently outdo us at the trading table, and we used people that are political hacks. We'd ever use our right people. We don't use our great businesspeople. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world, like in the world, and we don't use them.
We use political people, people that get there because they make campaign contributions to some politician, and it would drive me crazy. Then, of course, I was a very big contributor and I know the power of a contributor, and all of these politicians that I'm running against, you know, you look at like, you look at Cruz, you take a look at what he gets from the oil industry and from other industries.
You look at Jeb Bush, the head of his campaign is pharmaceutical, Woody Johnson of Johnson & Johnson. So what it comes down to bidding out drugs -- we're the largest drug purchaser in the world. They're not going to bid out the drugs. We would save $300 billion a year in this country if we bid out drugs.
You know, we don't beat them out. I just found out a friend of mine who's a doctor, called me and said, we don't bid out drugs that -- the biggest in the world. Can you imagine? We pay like almost the same as you'd pay if you walk into a drugstore. We're prohibited from bidding. I don't even know why that is. I mean, I do know why because these Senators are controlling the purse strings.
I mean because they're all paid off by campaign contributions. So I'm self-funding, I get no money from these people. I don't want any of their money. I could have so much money. I turned down so much money. They come in, you know, I've been the front runner. Well, it's one of those things. I've been, I've been the front runner, practically from June 16th, and when you're the front runner, sort of like the Apprentice.
I could have had anything. They wanted to extend the Apprentice for a long time and the head of Comcast, Steve Barker who's a terrific guy, came up to my office before I announced. He said we want to do it. We want to do it. We want to extend and you know, we had a great run, and it's a lot of money. When you have a successful show they pay you anything.
But I couldn't do it because I was doing this and I said Steve, I can't. I'm doing this. And he didn't sort of believe me. He said, oh, you're really not, you're really not. And they announced an extension which was a little confusing to people because they kept saying, I'm not going to do that. So we have Arnold Schwarzenegger doing it. How's Arnold going to do.
Could be good, right? Well, we're going to find out soon enough, right? You got to be very fast. When Omarosa goes after you, boom, boom, you've got to be quick, and you've got to be fast. So we'll find out if he's fast. But so it's -- you know, it's just something that I wanted to do because we can save so much money.
We can make such great trade deals. We have to rebuild our military. Our military's depleted. We have to take care of our vets. Al Baldesarra is back here and Al is a great vet, he loves the vets that is -- he goes all over the country talking to the vets and he knows the feel. It's not that he's with me. He likes what I'm doing the best.
But Al is a very independent guy and he'd go look at all of the different -- you understand though. But now you're with me. But Al would look at everybody out there and he sees who has the best, and who's going to do the best job for the vets. So I really appreciate Al being here. Al has actually, he's the big guy up in New Hampshire, and he wanted to come down here.
You have so many vets down here. They're so badly treated, so incredible. The illegals that come into the country are treated better than our vets, and we're going to change that around. So we're going to have strong borders. We're going to have really strong borders. We're going to have -- we're going to build a wall.
We're going to build that wall. It's going to go up. So 1,000 miles, the Great Wall of China is 13,000 miles. I think we can handle a thousand, right? We need a thousand, we have -- it's 2000 miles but we have a lot of natural barriers which are fine. But we're going to build a wall and it's going to be a real wall.
It's going to be a real wall, and people can come into the country, but they're going to come in legally. They have to go through a process and they're going to come in legally. So we're going to do the various things. And you know, this all started when on June 16th I came down. My wife actually said you know darling if you run you're going to win.
It's good that you have a wife who has confidence. But if you don't announce, you're never going to win because nobody's ever going to take polls of you, and you're never going to see -- yeah, but I want to take polls before I run. I don't want to like announce and then, it doesn't work out. She said don't worry about it, you announce you're going to win.
So sort of interesting. So they didn't want a poll and we announced, I announced, and literally from the beginning, once they found out I was willing to do it because it takes courage. It takes guts to run for president. This is not an easy thing in many respects. I'll tell you. And it's -- I don't care about the money.
But you know, to self-fund I never knew if I got the credit because you know, I'm the only one that's self-funding. I'm the only one, I'm putting up my own money and I'm in now for probably $25 million or close, and it's always a lot of money. Now, it's a fraction compared to what these guys are in because they're politicians, they have no idea how to spend money.
Sort of interesting. In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million, Bush spent $44 million. I came in first in a landslide and he was down at the bottom of the pack. Now, who do you want as your president? Anything. Now, when you think about it. If you think, I mean, you know, and everybody, I spend like, I think, less than anybody else.
And we get the best result. And wouldn't it be nice if our country could say that? We spent less than other countries and we had the best result. Education, we're number one for spending per pupil, by a factor that's so much higher, you wouldn't even believe it. By the way, we're getting rid of Common Core.
We're going to go local and you know. But we spent, we spent, so we spent so much -- second doesn't even exist, second place per pupil. So we're number one in spending. You have China, Sweden, Norway, lots of place, Denmark. All these countries, great educational systems. They spend far less than us per pupil, and we're number 30th in a list of 30. We're 30 in education.
So we're the worst and yet we spend the most. That's not what we want. So we're going to get things like that changed around. With military, with drugs, with so many other things, we buy things that they don't even want. The Generals don't want them. We drive -- we buy it because certain contractors have great political connections.
They've got better connections into the guys I'm running against, and we want to buy the equipment that they want. We don't want to buy equipment that they don't want because some firm has political -- have you ever see where they -- I'm sure you've seen it. Where we're buying a plane that we don't want even though the other plane they want and it's cheaper.
Only one reason, these guys get political contributions. There's only one reason and their lobbyists and their special interest on what to do. So we're going to change all that. We're going to get our budget back in whack and you're talking about -- and you know, we're going to make it better. It's not going to be where -- somebody said, well, will it be lean?
I said no, you're going to have a better cut. It's going to run better. With the waste, it's so incredible. For instance, if we bid out drugs, we're not allowed to bid out drugs. If we bid out drugs, we're going to save $300 billion a year. Can't think of it, $300 billion. I mean, who would think you don't bid out drugs.
Now, the reason is you don't bid them out because the drug companies are all funding these people. Not only them but all the Senate and the Congressmen and everything else. So it seems -- so that's why, I mean, we're going to do the right thing. I talk about -- often, I talk about the Ford plant that moved to Mexico.
Now, you saw last week, Carrier air conditioner. Anybody see that? Their Carrier, big thing. They're getting rid of all their jobs. They're letting everybody go and they're moving. Carrier, I'm not buying anymore. I buy a lot of air conditioners. I'm not buying anymore from Carrier. So they're moving to Mexico and the only way you stop them, I hate to say it, I'm a free trader but the only way and some Republicans would say, he is not conservative, you know, he is not a conservative person.
I'm common sense. The only way you stop them, move -- No, it's common sense. There's only one way you can stop them. You know, some guy would say, you can't charge them. Look, free trade is great. I'm for free trade but I'm also for smart trade, and I'm for trade like self-preservation. When these companies move to Mexico and then they make air conditioners.
They put them across our border, no tax, no nothing. We lose the jobs, we lose the factories, we lose the money. What do we get out of it? We get nothing. So they're moving to Mexico. So I would say, there's only one way to stop it and I went to Wharton, and I was a good student and all that's up. But you don't have to, you don't have to go to high school to know this.
You say very simply, enjoy your stay in Mexico. But every time you ship an air conditioner across that line, you're paying a 35% tax, folks. I'm sorry. And they're not going to leave. They're not leaving. They're not going to leave. Ford is $2. That's a big plant. Now, I've been talking about it for a year and a half.
I think it's terrible. So they'll close up places in Michigan and all over. And they're building $2.5 billion. Now, yesterday I read in the papers that they're doubling down. They're going to go much bigger now. Now, they've decided they're going to go and build even bigger. And I say, that's fine. But you know what, they're closing up all those places.
We're losing American jobs. You're going to pay a tax. You're going to send those cars across the border, they have the illegals drive them right across the border. They say go for it. Sure, nobody checks because you know, under Obama it's like Swiss cheese, right? So they hop on a Ford car. They drive it across the border.
They come back, you know, back and forth, no charge. Don't worry about it. Let the dumb Americans pay, the dumb Americans with they're really dumb leadership. Let them pay. And we're not going to be called dumb anymore. We're going to become, we're going to become the smart country. We're going to be the smart country.
And I'm tired of it. I see these things, I see this Iran deal where we give them $150 billion. We get nothing. I, mean this was negotiated by people that are incompetent, and we get nothing. So these things, Sergeant Bergdahl, OK? We get Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty rotten traitor, right? You see? Six people killed looking for him.
He left. He thought it was going to be a wonderful life. He'll go with, he'll go with ISIS or whoever he was looking to go with. He found that wasn't so good out there, right? They roughed him up a little bit, didn't they? I'd drop him right back in the middle of where the hell we found him. I would. I would.
I would do it. You know when I saw his parents, I saw his father, and I said, well, well what have we here, right? I said what have we here? That didn't look like Duck Dynasty, that was a shade different. I said, whoa, what's going on with the father here. And that was the first clue I had, right? What do I know?
What do I know? But we get Bergdahl and they get five of the best killers that they've been after for nine years that they covered it. And those guys are now back in the battlefield or soon will be, and they're looking to kill everybody including you and us and we get a traitor, OK? Five for one. I call him the five for one president.
This is what we have, we have people -- that's not business but it's business, it's trading. We don't get anything. We get treated horribly and not going to happen anymore. So I don't want any of your money, I just want you to go on Saturday. I want you to go out and vote which is tomorrow by the way. Hard to believe, right?
And in Iowa, we had a great time but we had a guy who cheated. I mean, you know, this guy Cruz, cheated. He really cheated. What he did to Ben Carson was a disgrace, OK? He cheated. Somebody just came up, you actually won Iowa and if the Republican Party had any guts, they would have terminated Cruz from that election because honestly, he cheated like a dog.
You know he holds up the Bible and then he cheats. And what he did with Carson was a disgrace where he said Carson had left the race. He's gone. He's gone. He left the race. Then he calls up Carson 10 minutes after the election ends, and he says, oh, we want to apologize. A lot of good it does, right? And then he does a voter violation certificate.
I have to tell you then -- and then he lies so much, but these politicians are bad. These are bad. These are dishonest people. Bad. I deal with businesspeople, you know, businesspeople like honest people compared to these politicians. These guys are the worst. But I was given some cover, I could talk about it because Rubio during the debate said, you're a liar.
I've never heard a politician call another politician a liar. But Rubio did so, once he did it, I said you're a liar because man does he -- he misrepresents. I'm the biggest guy on Second Amendment and he said, Donald Trump does not believe in the Second Amendment. I said that's exactly the opposite. And if you don't have a big voice, you can't, you know, you can't fight it. And maybe they'll apologize when the election's over.
But I don't want to apologize when it's over. I want to apologize before you get in the booth but tremendous. These politicians are bad news. So I think, we have a good chance of winning and if we win here, I'd think so. If we win here, if we win here, we have a tremendous chance of -- I think Nevada was great.
I've been -- I've got a lot of employees in Nevada, a great state, great place. I mean, it's caucus. So you never know with this caucus stuff. People walk in they're going to vote for Trump, all of a sudden they get into the spin rooms. It's -- the whole thing is ridiculous. I don't know if I like the caucus system too much, but it's what it is. You know, something nice about, you walk in, you vote, you leave, right?
Not you sit around for two hours and talk. But uh it's one of those things, but we have a very, very high approval rating in Nevada. So I think, we're going to do well there, and I think we're going to do fantastic in the SEC. We have the Tennessee thing coming up which is phenomenal. They've been unbelievable.
You know, they lost a big motor plant, too. They lost a big, a big plant. They're going to build a factory, a wonderful, wonderful place, and it ends up going to Mexico at the last minute. They were all set. They thought they had it. Ends up going to Mexico. Mexico is going to be the car capital of the world.
By the way, nothing against Mexico, nothing against China, great respect for China, I've made a lot of money with China. I have the biggest bank in the world as a tenant, 400 million customers this bank has. Think of it, 400 million. That makes Citibank look like a little, this like a little peanut. But they're my tenant in Manhattan and a great bank and I made a lot of money with condos.
I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco, a big chunk of it, and other buildings that I got from China, in dealing with China, tough dealing. Not easy dealing, tough dealing. They're tough and they're smart. But China's unifying and much -- Mexico's great, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders.
They're taking us to the clean -- and Mexico's beating us at the border, killing us at the border, killing us. When the pope came out, you know, he heard the Mexico side of the story. And tonight, he was, you know, and today, he was very nice. You probably heard, he put out a message that you know clean things up. But I will say, the pope was great and he's a very nice man.
But you know, he heard the Mexico side. We have to have a border and we have to stop illegal immigration. We have to stop all of the crime. We have 179,000 people that are criminals, right now. Illegal immigrants who are criminals, convicted criminals all over our country. What kind of a country is that?
It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. They're out, we're getting them out. We're not putting them in our jails. Why should we -- they send them, and don't kid yourself. You remember what I said. They send them over here because they don't want to put him in the jails. It's expensive to put them in jails.
Millions and millions and millions of dollars for a few people, I mean, it's ridiculous. We're getting them out of here. We're getting them out so fast. Before the wall goes up, we're getting them out of here. Believe me. And our local police who are fantastic. The sheriff is here. Where is the sheriff? Where is the sheriff?
What a great sheriff he is, my man, he just said I love you, Mr. Trump. And you can say that I love you, right Sheriff? He's with me. But I think, I have all of the police. Thank you, Sheriff and I hear, does he do a great job. I want your popularity.
I know I'd want it. Good. Thank you, Sheriff. That was a very nice statement, I appreciate. But I'm a big fan of the police, and I think, the police in this country have not been treated properly. You know you'll see, you'll see one event whether it's a mistake or you have a rogue. You know, you have a rogue problem, and it ends up being the biggest story for weeks and weeks and weeks, and they don't see the 99.99% of the great work that these people do. So you know, I have endorsements from everybody, the police.
We have a special relationship. And without the police, we're not here. We don't feel safe here. So important, and they've been treated unbelievably, I think, shabbily. So we're going to get that stopped. But we love our police and without them, it would be a much different country. That I can tell you. So Sheriff, thank you.
Thank all your men behind you. Thank you, men and women. So with that, I think, what we'll do is we'll take some questions. I just want to say that so we started in June. It was trade. It was borders. It was a couple of things and we had the problem. The big problem as you remember, in Paris where 160 people were killed, 130 people were killed, many, many, many in the hospital right now will never be the same.
Just brutally, brutally, I mean, many of them are going to die, actually. But, but really badly hurt. And when we talk about Second Amendment, if we had guns on the other side. There's a country that's the toughest gun laws in the world. Paris is the toughest in the world. Nobody has guns except the bad guys.
The bad guys have guns because they kept guns there. They put a gun in there. That's it. And if we had it in Paris or if we had in California, we had the 14 to two radicalized people, where she radically -- radicalized him. Who knows what happened. But they killed people, they gave them parties for their baby and gave them wedding parties.
They walked in, they killed 14 of them and others also the hospital, horribly hurt. If we had guns on the other side of those lines so that bullets could go the other direction also. You wouldn't have 14 people, you wouldn't have 130 people killed. That I can tell you. Would have been a whole different story.
So we have to protect our Second Amendment, folks. We have to protect it. And you know, people are really fighting it. And we have to protect a lot of our great institutions and a lot of our great things. But I tell the story all the time. I mean, if there were guns on the other side going in the other direction, it would have been a whole different story.
So that's that, but let's take some questions and go ahead, sir. Ah, we love Tom Brady, right? Look at the guy. How good, is Tom Brady the greatest? He's my friend. He's my friend, Tom.
We have to take jobs back from China, from Vietnam, from Mexico, from all of these countries that are just stripping us. From India, India is massive. We have to take jobs back from all of these countries, and we have to take back. We can't let it's -- we're being stripped. China has in my opinion done the greatest theft in the history of the world when they've taken.
They've taken our money, our job, millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of plants and factories closed, and we've rebuilt China. We've got to bring them back. We're going to bring them back. And I'm saying, I want Apple, first of all, Apple ought to give the security for that phone, OK? What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number.
How do you like that? I just thought it. Boycott Apple. Here's the thing. First of all, the phone's not even owned by this young thug that killed all these people. The phone is owned by the government, OK? Not even his phone. We don't even have to go that far. But Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up. They should get the security, you'll find other people.
When these two young people had bombs all over their apartment, on the floor, other people saw those bombs. Well, those people in a certain way are almost as guilty as the ones that did the shooting. We got to get to the bottom of it. And you're not going to get to the bottom of it unless we use common sense.
So I like the idea. Boycott Apple until such time as they give that information. I think that's a great idea. OK. Yes, yes, ma'am.
Well, the things that are the easiest are these executive orders that Obama signed because one good thing is -- the one really good thing is we can sign immediately, you can counter-sign and you knock out the executive orders. I mean, he's got an executive order where people can just pour into the country.
Now, the courts amazingly are stopping that right now, but at least temporarily. Who knows what's going to happen. But people are just literally pouring into the country. And I would get rid of that so fast. We end the court cases. Just get rid of it so fast, and others having to do with the Second Amendment, having to do with rules and regulations.
He's at a point where he can't get anything passed so he just signs executive orders. It wasn't supposed to be that way. So I would get rid of that very fast, OK? Sure.
You're not a senior.
She didn't look like you're senior.
Well, first of all, you know the other candidates aren't talking about races. They're talking about cutting your Social Security.
I'm the only one that's not cutting. I'm bringing the jobs back. I want to make our country rich again, and we're going to keep our Social Security. And you're not cutting the ages and you're not cutting it down at all. Every other person but me is cutting entitlements, and they're cutting Social Security.
So we're going to save Social Security. It's like I said, the medicine, $300 billion a year. That's one aspect. And it was given to me by a friend of mine who's a doctor. He couldn't understand why. As soon as he told me, I understood why. It's because of the guys that get all the contributions. All right, representing.
You know, as an example, Woody Johnson. Good Guy, Johnson & Johnson. He's in charge of Bush's campaign finance committee. Now, when Bush goes, he's never going to win. Bush has less chance than let's see, do we have any children in the room? But, but assuming he did win. Do you think Bush is going to negotiate the -- I mean, give me a break.
The head of the pharmaceutical industry is the head of his campaign. So that's now the way it works. So we're going to make our country rich again. We're going to find all of these things, there's so many. That's one, that's one that I found in about two seconds. There's so many of them. The military has so many.
We're going to make the military so strong, but we're going to make it better for less money. You know, you can build -- how? I just told you. Who said that? Oh, I just told you, darling. How? It's easy. Number one, and you have to do this, you have to get the equipment that we want. You have to take care of people.
You have to take care of our military because our military, and we don't want to use our military. Honestly, we don't want to use our military. But we're being scoffed at right now, and we never fight to win. You know, when we were all younger, many of you are my age and many of you are younger. But when we were all younger, we didn't lose so much, right?
We don't win anymore. As a country, we don't win and we're going to start winning again. We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning you're going to say, please Mr. President, I have a headache. Please don't, don't win so much. This is getting terrible and I'm going to say no, we have to Make America Great Again.
You're going to say, please. I said, nope, nope, we're going to keep winning. We're going to Make America Great Again. But by that time, I'll be able to take the again off. We're going to just have America be great, OK? So that's it. Go ahead, Al.
I am, too.
Well, we're going to look at that very much. I mean, we can balance the budget. Do you know that a balanced budget -- I was talking to one politician. He wants to balance the budget over the next 25 years. You've heard that too, 25 years. We're going to get the balanced budget and we're going to have a better country.
And we're going to have -- somebody was saying, well, if you balance the budget, what are you going to get rid of? There's so much waste, fraud, and abuse. We're not going to get rid of anything. You're going to have a better country. We'll have better service. Spend less money, we'll have better service.
We'll get it balanced. You watch. OK. Well, you watch. Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
Yeah, well, the Bernie thing. I'll be honest, I don't like to speak badly about Bernie. I'll be honest because I sort of want him to win so badly. Do -- Does that make sense to you? I'm torn. He's so easy to hit. And nobody hits him and Hillary's afraid to hit him, and she's been brought very far left and Hillary's got bigger problems in my opinion, right?
Do you ever see how nice she is to Obama? Oh, our president is so wonderful. He's so great. He's you -- yeah, you know why she's so nice, right? Believe me. I know why she's so nice. I know why she's so nice. I've never seen her like that. She panders to the president. She doesn't even like him, but she's pandering and everything.
Oh, our president has done such a good job. One of the worst presidents in history. So I hate, I hate to hit Bernie though because I'd much rather go against him. Now, I'd like to go against Hillary. I'm actually torn. I don't like, almost saying bad things against either because I sort of running -- want to run against both.
Is there any way I can run against both, OK? So we'll see but we're going to show you what's going to happen that the whole thing is -- the whole thing is ridiculous. This is not going to happen. Yeah, go ahead.
I'm pro-life. I'm pro-life. This is going to be huge. Aw, that's cute. That's cute. You made that? Yeah, pro-life, honey. Thank you. Cute. Thank you. It's very nice. You live here? Do you -- are you on the job? Very good. You're a little younger than some of the people in this place, right? We're going to have a lot of -- we have a young, we have a tremendous young group of people that like us. I think in the end, more so than Bernie, we just gave a speech 7,000; 8,000 people a little ways away.
And I'll tell you, the people were so young. It was amazing. Thank you very much. It's very nice, pro-life, OK? Let's see. Come on back here. Yes, sir. Go ahead. With a beautiful yellow sweater and a nice pen. Thank you for the pen.
Oh, beautiful, beautiful. I can see. Beautiful.
Do you notice that Obama never called Kate or the parents?
Right? You ever think of that? His Kate was killed by an illegal immigrant, came in five times at least, probably much more than that. Sanctuary city meaning, protection. Basically, it's a protection of criminals, I'll end sanctuary. First of all, defund sanctuary cities very quickly. If you're an illegal immigrant, you go through the same scrutiny.
You know, I have a friend, you know, Jamiel, who you've seen, he's incredible. In fact, we put him in a comm -- he lost his son, his magnificent son. He was going to go to college on a scholarship. He was shot in the face three times going home to his father. Just walking down the sidewalk. Great kid, like an incredible kid.
The father's an incredible guy. He's like a friend of mine now, and what this guy's gone through is like incredible. And I will tell you, you look at what's going on and you look at the kind of things that are going on with sanctuary cities and everything else. And one of the people because I've gotten to know so many people who have had daughters and sons and brothers and wives and everything else killed.
Killed. Viciously, violently killed by illegal immigrants. And it's so sad to talk to them and they tell me that the police go after them and the authorities go after them. When they find their illegal immigrants, it stops. It's like they stop. They can't get involved because it's so hard to do anything against an illegal immigrant.
They're rough and tough and smart. But when it comes to getting -- going after and maybe the sheriff would know even why this is, but they complain that when they hear it's an illegal immigrant they killed somebody or did some really harm to somebody. It's like becomes a whole different subject, and they don't go after him the same way.
Now, we're going to defund sanctuary cities. We're getting rid of sanctuary cities, and Kate was incredible, and horrible what happened. And to many other people, not just Kate. Yes?
Well, I'll tell you in business, we have Carl Icahn endorsed me, who's a great businessman. So for trade, you know, I don't want military people for trade. I want our great businesspeople. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We don't use them. I told you before, we use political hacks. And for trade, 100% we're going to use Carl Icahn.
We're going to use all of these great businesspeople, many of whom endorsed me. All of them want to endorse me. In fact, some of them want to endorse me and they want to have a news conference. I said nobody knows who you are. They might be worth $2 billion but nobody knows who you are. But these are the greatest negotiators.
We have the greatest negotiators in the world but we don't use them. When we lose $500 billion a year with China, $500 billion. It's more than that actually, but $500 billion a year with China. That won't happen with Carl Icahn in charge of a trade deal. That won't happen with other people who I won't use their names yet, but we have the greatest people in the world.
They all want to help. They don't want money. They don't want to have like, oh, they're going to get $200,000 a year. They don't want that. They don't want it. Their very rich people in many cases and just about all cases. That's why they negotiate well. But they're like chess masters, they're like Grand Masters.
That's what we need negotiating because we are being taken to the cleaners on trade like you've never seen. Military, we're going to find the best military. In other words, we're going to find the best people in the different categories. Trade's the easiest one to think about and you know, again, when I started, it started to be with trade and then border and the border was very important.
I mentioned during the speech, boy did I take heta, right? But then, they found out I was right. However, the other day one of the candidates, I saw him. We will build a wall. I said, where was this guy for the last 20 years? I said, well, my wife said, darling, did you hear he said he wants to build a wall.
Ay, what a bunch of losers. We will build a wall. And then I heard a second one the other day say the same thing. We'll, we're going to build a wall. The only thing is we're going to build it. Mine's going to be real. They don't know how to build walls. I know how to build real walls and, and that'll look very nice and very good.
But there's a big difference in building talent. The other thing, there's no way they get Mexico to pay for it. I get Mexico to pay for it, OK. Yes, ma'am?
That's true. I have a great campaign manager. Go ahead.
I'll tell you, it's a question I get so much, so much, colleges. And what's happened with college is a shame because these people that run the colleges are going through the roof. They don't care because the kids are like a conduit for money from the Federal government. So a kid goes in gets all the money he wants or her, gets all the money, goes to the colleges.
The colleges have totally lost control of their costs and it's costing so much money and they're spending so much money and the salaries for the top people are astronomical. And they don't care because they're getting the money from the Federal government. Unfortunately, the kids are the ones that are all your conduit, they have to pay for it. Does everyone understand that?
Like it's a really bad system. So the kids borrow more money, more and more money, the costs of colleges is gone up more than practically anything, far more than inflation, far more than any of your businesses because these guys figure what the heck. I mean, we're getting all this money essentially from the government and it's going to stop.
We're going to find out. It's going to stop but we've got to do something to help the kids because some of these kids are choking with that. And here's the problem, they get out of college and they can't get a job because we don't have any jobs. Don't believe the 5% stuff. We don't have 5% it's 25%, and many people are part-time.
You know, they're people that have worked for 30 years as full-time employees, all of a sudden are taught by the same boss, in the same factory that it's part-time. Your job is now part-time. They're never a part-time job in their life. Now, they have to get another second job someplace. We have it bad because of Obamacare.
That's exactly right. Because they have to keep under the threshold for Obamacare. This way, they don't have to pay the penalties and all the problems, right? Obamacare is a disaster. And I said it, I'll say it 15 times, repeal, replace, it's going to happen. But it's because of Obamacare. You're exactly right.
So the job numbers, it's 5%, but when you look for a job and you give up, which most people do. They look for a job, they give up. And then, statistically, you're considered employed, OK? That number was put to make presidents and politicians look good, OK? It's not a real number. We probably have a 25% unemployment number.
And you know what? If we didn't, if we had a really 5% unemployment, even with security, they like me for security, they like me for a lot of things. I doubt I'd be getting 25,000; 35,000 people coming into stadiums to see me, in all fairness, if we had a really 5% unemployment rate. People are very unhappy.
And remember this, the other thing that was reported accurately, there are very bad jobs. There are horrible jobs. These are not jobs where you're doing what you want to do and what you were educated to do. These are horrible jobs. So I just want to tell you that we're going to have to do something for the kids because we have kids choking on debt.
The debt is higher than it's supposed to be because the colleges have gone out of control in their cost. They've gone out of control in their cost, and that's human nature. Even the colleges, they sort of blamed them. But in a way, I say, you know, the Federal government is giving the money. The only thing is they go boom, boom, and then it goes from the student then.
They have lost, they haven't lost control, they purposely, they've raised it through the sky. And you look at what some of these people are making now. It's ridiculous and the kids are paying. So we're going to come up with a solution for the kids because the kids are two things; they're choking, they're choking on debt and they just don't see any way of doing it, and they can't get jobs.
You have kids go to great colleges. They work hard. They graduate high in their class. They're wonderful kids, wonderful students. They come out, they can't get a job. We're going to work on something that's going to be very good, I think, OK? It's such a great question and I hear it more than anything else.
Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
I got it, Al. My stance on coal is very simple. We right now are destroying an industry. We are destroying an industry and coal was, you know, it did things for us for many, many years. And we send our coal to China and China burns the coal and whatever -- they have no cleaning method. They don't care about it. I felt -- feel very strongly, you know, they have clean coal now.
They have machinery that cleans coal. And my stance on coal is very positive. Unlike Obama, where he's closing all of the mines, all of the miners. I know what's happening and believe me, and you know, they're talking about a lot of these other deals where they're talking, you know, wind. The wind is very tough because those windows are very, very expensive and they kill the birds, and they look very terrible.
Isn't it amazing the way the environmentalists love the windmills and yet, they kill all the birds? In California, if you kill a bald eagle, they put you in jail for five years. And yet, the windmills knock him out like, like flies. It's crazy. It's crazy. And then, the environmentalists say how great they are, how great they are.
The problem with wind, it's very expensive, they're very expensive to do. They really litter the landscape in my opinion. I mean, it's OK putting it in industrial locations and things. But when you see some of these fields, especially when you see like 15 different manufacturers, they're all different shapes colors, sizes, it's terrible, it's terrible.
You go to certain places in California where they have these, these areas, where everybody has their own little niche, and you see all of these different wind farms. You know, the places I'm talking about. I won't even mention. Why should I disparage in different places. I know I have too many friends that have houses there, they're going crazy.
But so -- wind is very tough. Solar, I love the concept of solar just doesn't work yet. It's a 30-year payback. And don't forget, then you have to buy new stuff before 15 years. You know, it doesn't last forever. Same thing with wind, you put up the wind, five years later, it's, it's rusted, it's rotted.
You have to replace it. It's not like it's there forever, but the coal has been there forever. We have an unlimited supply, and we send it to China. We send our coal to China. Do you think China cleans the coal? I don't think so. I don't think so. So I really believe strongly in clean coal. They have great equipment, they have great -- and I'm very bullish.
If I get in, I'm very bullish on the coal industry. Clean coal, OK? Thank you. Yeah. Go ahead.
He's a young Donald Trump. See that?
Very, very strong. Very, very strong, OK? I mean, I don't want to speak against myself, in all fairness. Very strong. You keep owning that property. Go ahead, sir.
Well, the Republicans have a problem -- I love the question. The Republicans have a problem. We have a structural problem. Number one, you have to win those six states. One of the advantages, I have, I have a chance of winning New York. You win New York, it's over because New York is so big. No other Republican has even a chance of winning New York.
So I have a chance to win New York. I'll win Michigan which is not even in the ballgame for one of the Republican people to win. But we also have people that are really bad. Karl Rove is very bad. He's in my opinion, he's close to incompetent. No, he's, he's good at raising money and then he spends the money, loses it. Does the worst ads I've ever seen.
Karl Rove is a bad guy, and he's, you know, he's just a bad guy. George Will is a bad guy. Stephen Hayes is a bad guy. I think Charles Krauthammer is a bad guy and bad guy. Now, I know, I know, I know. You can have them, OK? You can have them. No, I think he's a bad guy. I think we have a lot of people that are bad, really bad people.
And I think, they're petty. I think they're jealous. I think they've got a lot of problems. And we have a lot of people that are very bad for the Republican Party. We need new thinking. We have to have new thinking. Well, you're not going to have a party much longer. Look Romney should've won that last election, he lost by a lot, right?
He shouldn't have lost it. Romney had that election. We had a failed president. We had guys working like Karl Rove with raised millions and millions of dollars. Did some of the worst ads I've ever seen. And Romney lost the election. I mean, he should be president and we should have, you know, be re-electing Romney, again.
But he was -- he ran a horrible campaign, in all fairness. But you had a failed -- you had a failed system. You had a failed party. And I'll tell you if we don't win, you know, it's interesting. I backed Romney. He lost. I back McCain. He lost. This time, I said I'm doing it myself, OK? Enough of it. So I just want to thank -- there's an amazing group of people.
I'd love to play you in golf. I'll take my club champion over. I'd love to play you in golf but I'm not going to play much golf because there's a lot of work to be done. You know, Obama talks about the carbon footprint, right? The carbon footprint. He's always talking about the carbon footprint. And then he flies to Hawaii on a 747 with his family for Christmas.
He's there forever. I mean, he plays more golf than people on the PGA Tour. But he then flies back and then he has a news conference on the carbon footprint. I mean, give me a break. So you know, but if you're president -- we have a lot of work to be done. And playing golf is good. But you have to play with people that you have to make deals with.
You play with Congress, right? You play with Congress. You play with different people that you have -- You play with people from other countries. You play with prime ministers. You don't play with your friends. You play with people where -- because golf is amazing. Golf, you develop relationships on a golf course that you practically can't do anywhere else.
So it's great but you got to play with the people that are going to do good for the country. But I wouldn't be playing much. You know you go to the White House. I want to make do trade deals. I want to make do military deals. I want to buy the best equipment for the military. I want to make sure that we have the right, everything right.
There's so much to do that I wouldn't want to fly around and even all these meetings. You know, fundraisers, he gets on a 747, he spends $2 million or $5 million to fly to a location to raise a million dollars. Think of it. They spent $5 million, $5 million to go and, and go someplace and they raise $1 million.
Oh, we had a great fundraiser last night but it cost $5 million. When you turn on the engines of a 747, let me tell you. We're talking big money. Then you have all of the Secret Service who by the way are incredible people. They're all over the room, right? They're all over the room. They're incredible people.
But when you have all of the Secret Service and all of the tremendous cost of the plane, the 747 which I guess they ordered a new one. But these are the big old engines, and you know, you spend all of these millions and millions of dollars and you close down New York City. I mean, you have to go through it all the time.
He's in for a fundraiser, you go in -- I'd say what's wrong? I don't even ask anymore. I say the president's in town, the entire city is shut, right? You know what I'm talking about. The city is shut down. How do you spend $4 million, $5 million to do a fundraiser to make -- raise $1 million, OK? But that's the way it is. I think I'll try and do my fundraiser -- I hear you're not allowed to do that maybe in the White House.
So we'll do them in a hotel next door. We'll do it -- but one of my hotels, we'll do it. I don't care. I'm building one right next to the White House. I don't care. I don't want to -- I don't want to use it if it's a conflict of interest. I don't -- but seriously, instead of getting into a plane, use some room in Washington.
Maybe you can use the White House and have it. But use some room, which I don't think you can, but use some room -- who? We could. We could. We could use the old post office, but that would be good. But, but, you know, spend millions and millions of dollars, and this is the thinking of our country. So I just want to tell you that tomorrow we're going to Make America Great Again.
Tomorrow is so important that you get out and vote. We have a movement going on. I want you to read Time Magazine from last week. It was such an incredible story. It was so respectful of what we've done and not me, us. I'm like a messenger. But if everything works out well, like it did in New Hampshire, the people of New Hampshire were unbelievable.
I was going to win by 28 and we ended up with 36. And it was just a landslide. It was an incredible show. Every single category men, women, we won every category. And if we could do the same, and we're going to send a mandate. We're going to send a mandate to the world, in a sense, it's to the world. Not just here, it's to the world that we're back.
That we're back and that we're going to take our country back, and that we're going to have an amazing country again. And it's going to be run by really, really top of the line people. And we're going to run it the way we have to run it. And you're going to be so proud. And I hope that in two years, three years, four years, you're going to remember this meeting and, you're going to say that was a great meeting.
And that was the beginning of Making America Great Again. So I want to thank you very much. I hope you can go out and vote tomorrow. I hope, hope, hope. I don't want your money. I want your vote and I love you all. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good question. Thank you, everybody.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Pawleys Island, SC",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-pawleys-island-sc-february-19-2016
David Davis,United Kingdom,2017-04-11,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about today’s publication of a White Paper on the great repeal Bill.
Yesterday, we took the historic step of notifying the European Council of the Government’s decision to invoke article 50; the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. That notification marks the beginning of our two-year negotiation period with the EU, and it reflects the result of last year’s instruction from the people of the United Kingdom. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, it is our fierce determination to get the right deal for every single person. Now is the time to come together to ensure that the UK as a whole is prepared for the challenges and opportunities presented by our exit from the EU.
We have been clear that we want a smooth and orderly exit, and the great repeal Bill is integral to that approach. It will provide clarity and certainty for businesses, workers and consumers across the United Kingdom on the day we leave the EU. It will mean that as we exit the EU and seek a new, deep and special partnership with the European Union, we will be doing so from a position where we have the same standards and rules. But it will also ensure that we deliver on our promise to end the supremacy of European Union law in the UK as we exit. Our laws will then be made in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, and interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg, but across the United Kingdom. Some have been concerned that Parliament will not play enough of a role in shaping the future of the country once we have left the European Union. Today’s White Paper shows just how wrong that is. This publication makes it clear that there will be a series of Bills to debate and vote on, both before and after we leave, as well as many statutory instruments to consider.
Let me turn to the content of the White Paper. The paper we have published today sets out the three principal elements of the great repeal Bill. First, we will repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and return power to the United Kingdom. Secondly, the Bill will convert EU law into United Kingdom law, allowing businesses to continue operating knowing that the rules have not changed overnight, and providing fairness to individuals, whose rights and obligations will not be subject to sudden change. Thirdly, the Bill will create the necessary powers to correct the laws that do not operate appropriately once we have left the EU, so that our legal system continues to function correctly outside the European Union. I will address each of these elements in turn before coming to the important issue of the interaction of the Bill with the devolution settlements.
Let me begin with the European Communities Act 1972. Repealing the ECA on the day we leave the EU enables the return to this Parliament of the sovereignty we ceded in 1972 and ends the supremacy of EU law in this country. It is entirely necessary in order to deliver on the result of the referendum. But repealing the ECA alone is not enough. A simple repeal of the ECA would leave holes in our statute book. The EU regulations that apply directly in the UK would no longer have any ​effect, and many of the domestic regulations we have made to implement our EU obligations would fall away. Therefore, to provide the maximum possible legal certainty, the great repeal Bill will convert EU law into domestic law on the day we leave the European Union. This means, for example, that the workers’ rights, environmental protection and consumer rights that are enjoyed under EU law in the UK will continue to be available in UK law after we have left the European Union. Once EU law has been converted into domestic law, Parliament will be able to pass legislation to amend, repeal or improve any piece of European Union law it chooses—as will the devolved legislatures, where they have power to do so.
However, further steps will be needed to provide a smooth and orderly exit. This is because a large number of laws—both existing domestic laws and those we convert into UK law—will not work properly if we leave the EU without taking further action. Some laws, for example, grant functions to an EU institution with which the UK will no longer have a relationship. To overcome this, the great repeal Bill will provide a power to correct the statute book, where necessary, to resolve the problems which will occur as a consequence of leaving the European Union. This will be done using secondary legislation, the flexibility of which will make sure we have put in place the necessary corrections before the day we leave the European Union. I can confirm that this power will be time-limited, and Parliament will need to be satisfied that the procedures in the Bill for making and approving the secondary legislation are appropriate.
Given the scale of the changes that will be necessary and the finite amount of time available to make them, there is a balance to be struck between the importance of scrutiny and correcting the statute book in time. As the Lords Constitution Committee recently put it:
“The challenge that Parliament will face is in balancing the need for speed, and thus for Governmental discretion, with the need for proper parliamentary control of the content of the UK’s statute book.”
Parliament of course can, and does, regularly debate and vote on secondary legislation; we are not considering some form of governmental Executive orders, but using a legislative process of long standing. I hope that today’s White Paper and this statement can be the start of a discussion between Parliament and Government about how best to achieve this balance. Similar corrections will be needed to the statute books of the three devolved Administrations, and so we propose that the Bill will also give Ministers in the devolved Administrations a power to amend devolved legislation to correct their law in line with the way that UK ministers will be able to correct UK law.
Let me turn to the European Court of Justice and its case law. I can confirm that the great repeal Bill will provide no future role for the European Court in the interpretation of our laws, and the Bill will not oblige our courts to consider cases decided by the European Court of Justice after we have left. However, for as long as EU-derived law remains on the UK statute book, it is essential that there is a common understanding of what that law means. The Government believe that this is best achieved by providing for continuity in how that law is interpreted before and after exit day. To maximise certainty, therefore, the Bill will provide that any question ​as to the meaning of EU law that has been converted into UK law will be determined in the UK courts by reference to the European Court of Justice’s case law as it exists on the day we leave the European Union. Any other starting point would be to change the law and create unnecessary uncertainty.
This approach maximises legal certainty at the point of departure, but our intention is not to fossilise the past decisions of the European Court of Justice. As such, we propose that the Bill will provide that European Court case law be given the same status in our courts as decisions of our own Supreme Court. The Supreme Court does not frequently depart from its own decisions, but it does so from time to time. We would expect the Supreme Court to take a similar, sparing approach to departing from European Court of Justice case law, but we believe it is right that it should have the power to do so. Of course Parliament will be free to change the law, and therefore overturn case law, where it decides it is right to do so.
Today’s White Paper also sets out the great repeal Bill’s approach to the charter of fundamental rights. Let me explain our approach. The charter of fundamental rights applies to member states only when they act within the scope of European Union law. That means that its relevance is removed by our withdrawal from the European Union. The Government have been clear that in leaving the EU, the UK’s leading role in protecting and advancing human rights will not change. The fact that the charter will fall away will not mean that the protection of rights in the UK will suffer as a result. The charter of fundamental rights was not designed to create new rights, but rather to catalogue rights already recognised as general principles in EU law. That was recognised by the Labour Government who brought it in, with a protocol attached to it, in 2007. Where cases have been decided by reference to those rights, that case law will continue to be used to interpret the underlying rights that will be preserved.
I would now like to turn to devolution. The United Kingdom’s domestic constitutional arrangements have evolved since the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973. The current devolution settlements were agreed after the UK joined and reflect that context. In areas where the devolved Administrations and legislatures have competence, such as agriculture, the environment and some areas of transport, that competence is exercised within the constraints set by European Union law. The existence of common EU frameworks had the effect of providing a common UK framework in many areas, safeguarding the functioning of the UK internal market.
As powers return from the EU, we have an opportunity to determine the level best placed to take decisions on those issues, ensuring that power sits closer to the people of the United Kingdom than ever before. It is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of that process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved Administration. However, we must also ensure that, as we leave the EU, no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union are created. In some areas, that will require common UK frameworks. Decisions will be required about where a common framework is needed and, if it is, how it might be established. The devolved Administrations ​also acknowledge the importance of common UK frameworks. We will work closely with the devolved Administrations to deliver an approach that works for the whole of the United Kingdom and reflects the needs and individual circumstances of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Let me conclude by stressing the importance of the great repeal Bill. It will help to ensure certainty and stability across the board. It is vital to ensuring a smooth and orderly exit; it will stand us in good stead for the negotiations over our future relationship with the EU; and it will deliver greater control over our laws to this Parliament and, wherever appropriate, the devolved Administrations. Those steps are crucial to implementing the result of the referendum in the national interest. I hope that all sides will recognise that and work with us to achieve those aims. I commend this statement to the House.
",2017 Statement on Brexit,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-davis-2017-statement-on-brexit/
Andrew Cuomo,United States of America,2020-08-03,"And New Jersey Port Authority, who’s doing been doing an extraordinary job. The Port Authority does, among other things, the administration of the airports, building the new John F. Kennedy, rebuilding JFK. So he’s been doing double duty. And we have a great announcement today that we joined in this morning, which I’m going to chat about in a moment.
Today’s day 156, for those who are counting. If you’re not counting, it’s still date 156. Number of hospitalizations, 536. What does that number mean? It is a new low since we were in the midst of the battle. So, that is great news. Number of COVID patients in ICU, 136. Also a new low since the height of the crisis. Number of intubations, 62. Also a new low. So, that’s great news. Number of lives lost, a new low on the three day average. Three people passed away yesterday. So this is really all great, great news. And I congratulate New Yorkers, because this is purely a result of the actions that they’ve been taking.
The progress is even better than we expected. Remember when we started reopening, all the experts said, “Expect the infection rate to increase when the activity rate increases.” That’s what you’ve seen all across the country. That’s what you’ve seen in other countries. And that’s what we expected here. We then were talking about calibrating the increase and making sure it didn’t go that high, but it was supposed to go up. After two, two and a half months of reopening, the numbers have actually gone down, which nobody suggested. And that is really to compliment New Yorkers. We started reopening May 15th. That’s where it was on the curve. You call it a curve. I call it a descent of the mountain. We get to the same place. We just have different metaphorical images. But that’s where the reopening started.
Since the reopening, the numbers continue to go down. No expert predicted that. So New Yorkers are doing better than anyone else even expected. Cautious still. Well, why shouldn’t we be celebrating? Because look around, that’s why. Look at what’s going on across the country. Look at those increases. Look at what we’re dealing with in terms of now 39 States on the quarantine list, and look at incidents of lack of compliance. The numbers are a result of the actions, and we have been disciplined and we have to stay disciplined. In terms of enforcement, local governments have to do a better job. I don’t know how else to say it. We’re doing everything we can on the state side, the SLA and the state police are working double duty. We have a problem with young people and lack of compliance. We have a problem, especially at bars and restaurants.
Last night, they did another 29 violations. They checked 874 establishments. Over the weekend, they checked 3,000 establishments and did 106 violations. All this to say to the bars and restaurants, follow the rules. Because if you don’t follow the rules, chances are, likelihood is someone’s going to be there to watch and to check. And that’s the way it should be. If you’re following the rules, fine. If you’re not following the rules, if I were you, I would be worried. And that’s the way it should be. We’re seeing continued situations that are just not intelligent, and local governments have to crack down on these, whether they’re in New York city or Long Island, or they’re in upstate New York. How a charter boat could put together a crowd on deck and leave. It’s just disrespectful. It’s illegal. It not only violates public health, it violates common decency. Look at all the people you endangered. What if one of those people on that cruise gets sick and dies? What if the one of those people on that cruise get sick and goes home and gives it to a parent who dies. I mean, it is just really reckless, rude, irresponsible, and illegal. We need better enforcement, all across the state. On the issue of schools, I want to be clear. We have 700 school districts in this state. The districts are putting in plans on how they will handle the reopening. I’ll make a determination later this week on the infection rate, whether or not we’re going to reopen schools. But just because a district puts out a plan, doesn’t mean that if we reopen the school, parents are going to come or teachers are going to come. It’s not, “Well, the government said the schools are open. Now everybody must go.” It’s not going to happen that way. I’m talking to parents. I am telling you it is not going to happen that way. They are not going to trust the school district. This is an issue of public health. Just because the school district says you shouldn’t worry about your child’s public health, that’s not going to be enough. Not in this environment. Not when you’re dealing with situations that everybody knows that nobody has the facts.
Parents are going to want to understand the information for themselves. I’ll tell you what they’re asking me. I’ll tell you what they’re going to ask every school district. How are you going to test? How many tests are you going to take? Are you sure you have them lined up? Are you sure those are enough tests? Is it a representative sample? How long is it going to take to turn around the tests? Is it two days, four days, seven days? They’re informed parents. They’re the most informed people on this issue, probably in the country. They’ve lived through it. They’re going to have questions. This is not going to be the school district puts out a plan, and then by Fiat, by dictatorship, that is the plan.
You need the parents to be comfortable. You need the teachers to be comfortable. You need the children to show up at school. And there’s going to have to be a discussion. You look at some of these plans, they’re indecipherable. Even if you can understand the plan, they raise questions. And parents are going to need to talk it through. I encourage every school district, set up a discussion room now. Start explaining to the parents now. Have those conversations now. You can’t call people into a conference room, but you can invite them onto a video chat or onto a chat room. But they have questions and they need answers. And time is short. That should start now, because the parents are going to make the decision. Nobody’s going to tell them me whether or not I should send my child to school. I’m going to make that determination. And I’m going to want to make sure it’s an informed determination. And I’m not going to trust just what’s on some school districts plan. I’m not going to do that. And parents have to be comfortable, and they should be comfortable because they are the ultimate decision makers here.
Just because I say the infection rate is low, that’s not going to cause a parent to send the child back to school. Just because of the school district says, “We have a safe plan.” I’m telling you, it’s not going to work. They have to feel comfortable, which means they have to be part of the process. We have to have a dialogue. I want to congratulate the Port Authority, Rick Cotton, who runs it. Chairman Kevin O’Toole. The Saint Nicholas Greek church has been a long saga for New York. Was destroyed in 9/11. It was supposed to be rebuilt. There were fits and starts. Bureaucracy was slow. This was slow. But I was just with his Eminence, the Archbishop, and it is now being rebuilt. It is magnificent. It really is a beautiful structure. It is the only church on 9/11. Part of…
The only church on 9/11, part of it is going to be a bereavement center. It’s not just a Greek church, it’s a universal center for reconciliation. It is a spiritual place. And we’ve been trying to get it done for a long time. Sometimes God works in funny ways that it is now being rebuilt at this moment, all these years after 9/11. Why this moment? Maybe because God says he needs or wants a symbol of renewal and rebirth at this moment. Maybe it was God’s way of saying to New Yorkers, yes, this is a tough time. Yes, we’ve been dealt a hard blow, but we can rise up, we can build back and we can build back better. St. Nicholas is better than the church that was there before. We didn’t just rebuild St. Nicholas. This is a vastly improved physical structure from what it was. This is going to be a national landmark, St. Nicholas, when it’s done.
And I think there’s a symbolism there for all New Yorkers. We’re going to have to build back. There’s no doubt about it. We don’t even understand the extent of the economic damage that has been done. And it’s going to be hard, I’m telling you that. But we’ve done it before, we’ll do it again. And that’s what St. Nicholas said to me today when I was there. In terms of the national situation, and I want to speak plain truth on this, we said we have two threats. We have the lack of compliance and we have the national situation. The national situation is getting worse, it’s not getting better. That is a fact, as I like to say. It’s an inarguable fact. You look at the numbers, look at what’s happening in Florida, look at California, look at Texas. Look at the numbers. Look at what’s happening all across the Midwest, where you’re seeing a dramatic rise.
Look at what the White House is now saying, where you entered a new phase of COVID. What’s the new phase? Extensive spread. Oh, that’s the new phase? What was the old phase? If the new phase is extensive spread, what was the old phase? That was limited spread what we went through? I mean, it’s absurd. It’s not a new phase. It was entirely predictable. It was the progression of a virus, its exponential increase, which is what a virus does. One person affects two people, two people infect four… It is the exponential pyramid of viral spreads. It’s not a new phase. It was a mathematical equation that you just have to factor out. You have medical experts who are now saying we should hit the reset button, that the nation should shut down and start over. That that’s the only way to stop the virus. That’s what medical experts are saying.
Hit the reset button, shut down everything and start all over again. That’s a damning commentary on where we are. Hit the reset button. Just close all the states and start over. Look, you want to start over, you want to hit the reset button? I’ll tell you how we hit the reset button in this country. We start this time with the truth. We do something different than was done in this country six months ago when this started. Start with the truth. Tell the American people the truth. And it starts on a reset with the president of the United States telling the truth, which he did not do six months ago. And if you want to hit the reset button, and you need to hit the reset button, and I believe we need to hit the reset button, then hit the reset button, but do it honestly and it has to start with the president telling the American people the truth. The truth is, it was a mistake to deny COVID.
It was a mistake to downplay COVID. It was a mistake to say, it’s just the flu. It was a mistake to say, it’s gone by Easter. It was a mistake to say, it’s going to magically disappear when it gets warm. It was a mistake to say, I see the light at the end of the tunnel. It was a mistake to say, yes, we’re going to do testing, but I don’t think we need it. Those were all mistakes. Those were all untruths and they sent the wrong message to the American people, because some people heard the president and believed him. And if you believed him, you wouldn’t take COVID seriously. And if you didn’t take covert seriously, then you wouldn’t take the precautions that people were saying you should take. But that’s what the president of the United States was saying six months ago. The president of the United States said five months ago, reopen the economy, liberate the states, liberate the economy.
His governors are slow-walking reopening. They’re just playing politics. That’s what they’re doing. There’s no reason not to reopen the economy. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Florida jumps, Texas jumps, Arizona jumps. Yes, we’re just going to reopen the economy. That was a mistake. It was an untruth. It denied the science, it denied what they’re saying now, the virus will spread if you do that. Tell the truth. The truth is, it was a mistake that when you saw what was going on in New York five months ago, you didn’t heed the warning. It was a mistake when you saw the spike in New York, you thought somehow those people were different and your people were immune. Your people aren’t immune. New Yorkers had no different immune system that made them more contagious to the virus. It was a mistake to deny the reality that happened in New York that was broadcast across the country. That was a mistake.
It was a mistake to see what we had to do here in New York; the testing, the hospital system, the contact tracing, the close down, the phase reopening, and pay no attention to it, no attention to it. Six months later, these states still don’t have testing and contact tracing. How can it be? You had six months. Here in New York, we had two weeks. We were ambushed because the virus came from Europe and nobody told us. These other states at six months, how did you not set up a testing operation? How did you not expand the capacity of your hospital system? How did you not locate additional staff? How did you not locate additional PPE? You had six months. The reason they didn’t, because they were listening to the president. There is no issue. There is no problem. It was a mistake. Tell them the truth. The truth is, COVID is serious. It is deadly serious, and it’s deadly serious for all of us.
It’s not deadly serious for Democrats, it’s not deadly serious for blue states only, COVID kills Republicans and COVID affects red states. It is deadly serious. It was not a political issue and it shouldn’t have been politicized. This is not a political issue and it shouldn’t have been politicized. This is public health. That’s what this was. And it should have never been turned into a political symbol, which is what this president did. Start with the truth. And the truth is, an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere. That’s what we should have learned in China. That’s where we should have learned from MERS and SARS and Ebola and swine flu and H1N1. An outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere, and it’s still true. And the truth is none of us are safe until all of us are safe. That is the truth. If we don’t tell the truth on the reset, COVID will never end and it will ricochet across the country.
It will just bounce back and forth. You see how it’s bouncing now, it’s ricocheting. It’s Florida, it’s Texas, it’s the Midwest, it’s California. Oh, it’s back to New Jersey is on the rise. Oh, it’s back to Massachusetts is on the rise. It will continue this ricocheting across the country because that’s what viruses do. It will never end. This was a colossal blunder how COVID was handled by this federal government, colossal blunder. Shame on all of you. Six months-
Shame on all of you. Six months, lives lost, hit the reset button, yes, but the way the medical experts are talking about it, it won’t work. It won’t work unless you hit the reset button and you start with the truth. Because if the American people are continued lying to, the confusion and the chaos and the denial will continue. Hit the reset button. It’s called the truth. It’s called the plain truth.
The American people are smart. If the President actually tells them the truth and says, “I made a mistake,” he’s not going to be telling them anything they don’t know. Every American knows he made a mistake. Every American knows this was the worst government blunder in modern history. Not since the Vietnam War have American sat in their living room to see the numbers on the TV screen every night saying what a mistake it was. During the Vietnam War, every night you saw the death toll, you saw the injury toll on TV. Every night they’ve seen this virus increasing all across the country and the death toll going up.
You don’t think they know it was a mistake, then you don’t know the American people. They are smarter than you think. Trust the American people. And if you don’t trust them and you don’t trust their intelligence, and you don’t trust their ability to handle the information, then you shouldn’t ask to be their leader. I trust the people of New York. I told them the truth. I told them the facts. I never sugar coated. I never shielded. I told them the truth so they knew what to do, and they did it. That’s what we call being New York tough and smart and united and disciplined and loving. They should try it in Washington.
Questions?
I don’t know the status of the individual school plans. SED is looking at that, state health officials are looking at that. My point is different. My point is this is not going to be between a school district and the state, or a school district and the State Education Department. This is between the school district and the parents. The ultimate decision maker are the parents. And I don’t hear enough about the parents’ concerns and the parents’ involvement and the dialogue with the parents.
It’s not going to be school district to the state, school district, to the SED. Yeah, I’m not going to allow any school to open that I don’t believe… If we don’t have a safe environment. That’s not going to happen. And I think New Yorkers know that, by the way. That doesn’t mean that school is safe. It doesn’t mean the school they’re going to send their kid to is safe.
And by the way, all they care about is the school that their kid is going to. “Oh, it’s very nice. The infection rate is good in my region, that’s nice. How about my kid’s school? That’s all I care about. And just because you send me a form that says it has been determined that school is safe to return to, no, it’s not enough. It’s not enough for me. I want to review the plan. I want to understand the plan. I have questions that I want to ask.” They’re asking me the questions. I mean, they’re good questions. “The school district is going to test. How many tests? How many kids do you have? How many tests? Is that a representative sample? How long is it going to take you to get the test returns? Do you know? Where are you going to find these tests? You don’t have them now. Where are they going to come from? All the information says the test results are coming back slower. You’re going to get them done faster? How?”
I mean, these are smart people with good questions and you’re talking about my child’s health. Marcia?
We’re going to approve an infection rate that says, from an infection rate point of view, the environment is safe to open the school. That’s all I’m going to say. I am not saying PS 109 is safe. In the city, I don’t even think the plan speaks to PS 109. And that’s what the teacher, what the parents are going to want to talk about, is PS 109.
Well, if there is not… SED is supposed to review that, and the State Department of Health. And if it is clearly on its face not safe, then it won’t be approved. But my point is, Marcia, I don’t care what any bureaucrat says. I trust the parents more than anyone. And I don’t care if a school district says reopen. If they don’t have a good plan for reopening, no kids are going to come and no teachers are going to come, so then you have no reopening, so you’re talking to yourself.
Well, where you have a district with multiple schools, they have to address the plan for every school. Now, you’d have to have a uniform plan. You could have a uniform plan for every school. Every school will have 15% of its students tested on a weekly basis. That comes out to 8,000 tests. I’m getting those 8,000 tests from Quest Lab. They’re required. They’re going to be there. By the contract, it says Quest Lab will do the 8,000 tests, the turnaround time will be two days. If the child is positive within two days, that child will be removed for 48 hours. You know, you’re going to need that level of specificity.
I haven’t seen the city plan. I don’t review the actual plans, but if you don’t have the details for each school, then you don’t have a plan. Because how can a parent make a decision? And it’s not just New York City, you know, it’s any school district. I’m talking to parents all across the state. And the questions I’m giving you are verbatims from parents, right? They’re what you would ask. They’re what I would ask. And, well, we have a additional information? No, we don’t. I’ve been doing these briefings for a lot of days. People know the questions about this issue. We’re not talking about some normal government issue, taxes, budgets, roads. This is their life. They know what they’re talking about.
Great question, and it’s the number one question any parent is going to ask.
What is the representative sample, let’s say the universe is 1.2 million, what does your health department say is a representative sample? You need to test what percent of that 1.2 million to be meaningful on what basis? And then how do you do it? That’s why I’m saying the conversation is going to be all about the details.
Pete?
It doesn’t-
Make sure this is done safe-like.
It doesn’t, because I don’t think there’s anything unexpected there. I don’t think the Indiana School District is unexpected. I don’t think that Georgia camp is unexpected, that’s why we didn’t open camps. I don’t think the Israel experience with schools is unexpected. We know this point. We knew this six months ago, we knew all of this six months ago. That’s why it’s so frustrating that we’re still talking about this at such a level of ignorance and denial, and we’re so woefully unprepared.
I mean, I was in Savannah, I was talking to the mayor of St. Petersburg. We still don’t know that we have to do tests and we don’t have that set up? But anyway, you have a large congregation of people, you put them in a place, it’s the New Rochelle super-spreader. It’s the New Rochelle-super spreader. Our first week, one person goes to a congregation, goes to a wedding ceremony, infects dozens. School is no different. So I don’t care what the building looks like. It doesn’t matter. School, church, temple, mosque, cafeteria, restaurant, it’s all the same.
So is there the potential between now and the opening of school, if you see things happening, what you describe, and you say, “I cannot in good conscience, allow schools to open up for now, pull the plug for now, case closed”?
It would take to one of two things. Either A, the infection rate would have to go up where you knew you were dealing with a highly charged environment, or two, a particular school district wouldn’t have an acceptable plan. I believe the unacceptable plan is going to be determined more by the parents and the teachers. We have 1.1 million students, let’s say, in New York City. Okay, so you have roughly how many parents, 2 to 3 million? You have 2 to 3 million people looking at that plan. They’re going to determine if it’s safe, they’re going to blow the whistle. And then if a school does not have a safe plan, then we wouldn’t allow it to open.
The problem is you’re not dealing with an absolute. It’s going to be a relative decision. Not opening schools is also highly, highly problematic. You know that you were affecting socialization issues for children. You know that you may be subjecting some children to a dangerous situation at home. You know, you may be aggravating food insecurity, that children can’t eat. You know that you will be aggravating the disparity between wealthier households and poorer households, because remote learning is not an equalizer, it is a separator. It works better where you have two parents at home with a wealthier household that has technology, et cetera. So neither option is perfect. It is a relative decision.
I don’t know that anyone has looked at the plans. Some plans have not come in. Some plans are too top line to actually answer the questions, because these are the questions. If a plan doesn’t answer these questions, the plan is not sufficient. So some plans are in that category. I know they’re talking to districts, many of the districts have said, “Oh, I’ll send more detail,” so we don’t even really have the plans, they sent in a top line, and now they have to send in the actual details. Because the devil is in the details. There’s no top line here. The top line is easy. “I can open the schools, everybody’s going to be safe, I’m going to do testing, I’m going to do cohorting, have a nice day.” But I don’t believe they’ve gotten to the point where they have declined any program. And I don’t believe SED has even started really looking through them. I don’t run SED, it’s a state agency. Everybody thinks I’m responsible, I’m not. The State Education Department is totally separate.
I’m not going to let Washington off the hook. They have to deliver. They have to deliver. We have federal representatives, we have senators, and we have Congress people. We pay them to pass a piece of legislation that’s going to help New York. And it’s simple. If the legislation is not going to help New York, you know what I say to them? “Don’t pass it. It can’t pass without you. It can’t pass without you. Don’t pass a piece of legislation that doesn’t restore New York’s funds. If you pass a piece of legislation that requires New York to raise taxes, raise a millionaire’s tax in this economic environment in New York City, where we’re struggling…” We used to be worried, millionaire’s tax, people might leave. No, no, no. The burden shifted. We’re trying to get people to come back. We’re trying to get them to come back.
COVID is under control. We’re going to make progress helping the homeless. We’re going to clean up the graffiti. We’re going to fix crime. On top of that, you want to say, “And by the way, when you come back you even get a big tax increase.” Our population, 1% of the population pays 50% of the taxes, and they’re the most mobile people on the globe. I literally talk to people all day long who are now in their Hamptons house, who also lived here, or in their Hudson Valley house, or in their Connecticut weekend house. And I say, “You got to come back. When are you coming back? We’ll go to dinner, I’ll buy you a drink. Come over, I’ll cook.”
They’re not coming back right now. And you know what else they’re thinking? If I stay there, they pay a lower income tax, because they don’t pay the New York City surcharge. So that would be a bad place if we had to go there. Senators, Congresspeople: don’t pass a bill that hurts New York again. And by the way, their argument is so easy. The federal government caused the New York state problem. It was the negligence of the federal government. How did they not know the virus went from China to Europe and came to New York? How did they not know that?
Department of Homeland security, CDC, NIH, all these federal agencies, all this taxpayer money, nobody said, “Oh, the virus is in China in December? Maybe it’ll infect someone who gets on a plane.” Nobody thought that? December, January, February, nobody thought in three months that the virus might be traveling? After MERS, after SARS, which also happened in China from a wet market, a poultry market and came to the United States. Nobody thought, “Oh, this might be like every other past viral transmission”? It was the federal negligence. And now they’re not going to pay for the damage they did? Don’t vote for the bill. Don’t vote for the bill. Have a nice day.
",NY Governor Cuomo COVID-19 Press Conference Transcript August 3,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/ny-governor-cuomo-covid-19-press-conference-transcript-august-3
Ron DeSantis,United States of America,2020-05-03,"… from some of the physicians about, one of the things with phase one is going to be quote unquote “elective procedures” returning to the hospitals. CDC had recommended about two months ago or certainly six, seven weeks ago that governors freeze ” elective procedures.” Part of the reason they wanted to do that was to make sure there was enough hospital space, which just from the data I thought that we would have that, but then they were also concerned about a lack of PPE, and at that time there was a real concern about that. So we ended up doing it. But as we’ve gone through this, as hospitals have had more than enough capacity, there’s obviously a need to to bring that online. So that’s going to start tomorrow. Some of the docs are going to talk about what all that means. These are really important things for people’s health, and we want to make sure that people understand that this is something that they’re going to be able to schedule going forward.
In terms of what happened here in Volusia County, I think if you look, if you go back the last a week to 10 days, you’ve had two times where there have been a significant, anything out of the ordinary with cases reported and those were both connected to the prison here. You both have inmates and staff. That obviously is an issue. It’s a separate issue from kind of how it’s going in the community I think. But if you’ll look at April 24th, there were 10 new cases, then four cases, three, seven, three, four. You did have the 46 with the prison on the 30th and then seven and seven, and the percent positive has pretty much been, in the last week to 10 days, in that 1.5 to 2% accepting the prison dump, when they had the prison stuff. If you look at the syndromatic indicators for Volusia, everything’s trended downward in terms of the admissions to the hospital.
So I think that the community here has handled it well. I know Jeff can talk a little bit about how they did it, how they’ve done. I know we’re going to hear about how they treated, they really did a good thing here, and I’ll let them talk about kind of creating a separate containment unit. We have a, one of the biggest problems we’ve seen in the last six weeks is people that have heart problems or stroke symptoms deciding they don’t want to go to the hospital. Sometimes that is because that they’re worried about being exposed to COVID. I think you’ll hear what Halifax did. There’s really no chance of that because of how they’ve segregated the units, but it’s certainly important for people if you do have those. The hospital’s a safe place to be and taking care of yourself is very, very important.
I’m finally pleased to be able to say testing has been a big part of what we’re doing, but diagnostic testing is not the whole thing. You can go and test negative today. That mean you can’t acquire the virus two days from now or three days from now. And so it is a part of it, but it’s not the entire part. What you also need to have is serological testing, antibody testing. That is testing that will determine whether somebody has the antibodies that would be associated with having had the disease. What they’re finding throughout the country in places like Santa Clara, California, University of Miami did a study in Miami-Dade, New York is doing this, is that the number of people with the antibodies far exceeds the number of people who’ve actually tested positive at a diagnostic test. And so that has implications for how you deal with the epidemic going forward.
So I thought this is really, really important for Florida. We have a bunch of these things coming in from the all kinds of sources, but we finally got our first 200,000 in at 3:00 in the morning. I’ve been bugging Department of Emergency Management, Department of Health for a long time for that. So they have 200,000 and those are going to be deployed in the coming days. It’ll probably be a combination of providing some to hospitals so that the healthcare workers can get tested, doing a lane in our drive-through test sites so that if people do want to get the antibodies, they can come in and get the antibody testing. But then there is going to need to be, and we may partner with universities on this, there needs to be some scientifically representative sample testing. So you go in different parts of the state, create a scientifically representative sample, test for the antibodies, and then see how prevalent those are in various parts of the state.
The Miami study suggested that at the time, I think Dade County had 10,000 confirmed positive tests. They think it was antibodies about 160,000. So that’s obviously several, several times more. So we want to know what, how that is in other parts of the state of Florida. And I don’t know that the antibodies, I think you’ll definitely see some divergence there just as we’ve seen divergence with the epidemic overall. But I do think the antibody test is important. Then if you’re somebody and healthcare that has the antibodies, you’re going to want to know that. That’s going to be very helpful. Certain workers in other sectors that have the antibodies going to be very, very helpful. Pretty much everyone agrees it confers some level of immunity. People don’t know how long. Some have said maybe as low as six months, maybe two years. I think scientists will figure that out. But clearly it’s a benefit to have the antibodies.
We’re going to continue doing our drive-through sites as we get into phase one, these test sites we have. Now we’re supporting or running in conjunction with the National Guard 11 drive-through sites and we have plans to open more. The thought is, is if people, someone goes to work and they have a symptom, that they know there’s an easy place they can go. This is not going to even be close to all the testing because you have medical providers are doing more and more. Private sector is doing a lot of stuff. But we do think it’s important.
So I was just in the panhandle. They haven’t had a huge epidemic there, but we’re putting one there in Escambia County to be able to serve those folks. One of the things that we’re seeing that’s been effective are our walkthrough sites where we actually go into underserved communities, set up sites where people can walk up and get tested. We’re probably going to want to fold some antibody testing into the walkup sites, but we see those in different regions of the state of Florida. This is something that we’ve started within the last few weeks, and they’ve already done, they’ve completed 12,000 tests for those walkup sites, which is very, very important.
Jeff and I talked, and some of the docs, talked about how important it is to safeguard nursing homes and as part of this rollout of the “elective surgeries,” the hospitals, when they’re doing it, they’re certifying effectively that they do have space in the hospital, that if you did have increase in COVID patients they could handle it, that they have adequate PPE. They’re not going to run to the state for more PPE. But then we’re also asking that everyone play a constructive role at helping our nursing home residents. What they did at Halifax is exactly the best practice that Secretary Mayhew has been talking about from the beginning.
From the very beginning, she was worried about hospitals sending in COVID patients back into a nursing home and then infecting all the other places there. What Jeff is doing is that if somebody comes in with COVID in a nursing home, they need two positive tests before they’re sent back, so that we have confidence that they’re not going to infect other people. If they come in for a non-COVID reason, they’re still given a test before they get sent back to the nursing home. I’ll let them talk a little bit more, but that is basically what we want to see for all the healthcare providers. I think you are seeing that, by and large. I know Cleveland Clinic is doing something similar. But that is a way to help fight the epidemic and that’s a huge, huge thing.
But we have National Guard. I have 50 National Guard units going into nursing homes and offering testing residents and staff. And what’s happened is we found more positive cases doing that, but a lot of these cases are asymptomatic. And so then you’re able to contain the cluster as it develops, and that that keeps it, because if these things are left to spread unabated in a nursing home, this thing can really spread like wildfire. So we appreciate the Guard doing that.
We’re going to roll out this week a mobile lab inside of an RV. The lab is going to be able to do the 45-minute test. So we’re going to have 3,500 tests a week. We’re going to go to different longterm care facilities to start, offer these tests and then be able to get results back very, very quickly. So that’s a huge, huge thing. And I want to thank the White House, helped us getting these 45-minute tests for this mobile RV lab. And so I think that that’s going to be something that’s good. So we’ll have an announcement on that when it’s ready to roll. But I’m really excited about it.
The state-supported testing, hospital testing is great, but there’s more private sector actors that are getting involved in this. I recently signed an executive order to allow licensed pharmacists to conduct COVID tests. So Walgreens has announced that they’re going to do nine drive-through sites in Florida. So they’re going to have one in Hillsborough County, one in Volusia County in Orange City, one in Opa-locka in Miami-Dade, one in Miami proper in Miami-Dade, Winter Garden in the Orlando Orange County area, Orlando proper, and then Jupiter and Palm Beach County. They probably will ended up doing some more, but that’s good. So there’ll be one here in the Western part of Volusia County. CVS is going to announce plans soon. So Walgreens, CVS, that’s very, very convenient for a lot of people. And then by early next week, Walmart plans to have five drive-through sites throughout the state. And so I know there’ll be an announcement on that forthcoming.
So we are continuing to stress the need for testing and building a really strong infrastructure. Nobody really knows what the shape the epidemic’s going to take. As we go into phase one, we just have to wait and see and look at the data. There’s some people that think that we’ve kind of gotten through this as a country. That it may subside and then really come back in the fall. Well if that happens, we’re going to have a much better infrastructure put in place than the country had in February and early March. And so there’s new products coming online all the time. New technologies coming on all the time.
I mean, just going back two or three weeks from today, there’s so much more available than there even was. And then as you were getting through March and into April, seems like there was a new emergency use authorization almost every other day from the FDA. So the private sector has really got involved in this and is really pushing out a lot of great products. So we’re going to just continue to do what we need to do to be able to build that good infrastructure.
But I’m happy to be here to talk about this really important component about getting into phase one as a state. And I know that this is going to help the health of a lot of people in the state of Florida, and it’s also going to help the hospitals function. But a lot of people don’t recognize is we took a lot of these actions to be able to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed. That obviously has succeeded. We have not seen that in Florida. But because all these other things were not happening, a lot of hospitals had to furlough workers. And so some of the capacity was actually diminished on the backend. So this will allow kind of the system to start running again, like it should. And obviously it’d be good for people’s health. So I’m going to kick it over to Jeff. Let him say …
So it’d be good for people’s health. So I’m going to kick it over to Jeff. Let him say a few things about these surgeries. If you can touch on how you guys have handled the nursing home patients, I think that’d be good, too.
Can you just speak about the gamut of procedures that would be considered “elective”? I mean, because I think sometimes people hear elective and think unnecessary.
Great. And then Dr. Harman, can you talk about your unit and how you guys have handled the COVID patients that come in?
Great. Well, Dr. Crossman, do you want to talk just generally about, I think, you had made some comments about people when they have different conditions, what they should be doing, and obviously, I think there’s been a lot-
And conditions, what they should be doing. Obviously I think there’s been a lot of discussion on the safety here, but maybe to reiterate that and any other thoughts you think are important.
Great. Well I want to thank everybody for all your hard work, and I’m excited that you’re going to be getting some of these procedures going again. I think it’s going to be good for the health of folks throughout the Volusia County region, obviously throughout the state of Florida. So as we’re going into phase one, we believe in doing safe, smart step-by-step approach. It’s not that there’s going to be an earth shattering difference between phase one and what we’ve been doing. I mean we’re deliberately going to be cautious. This obviously is very important. I don’t know, in the general public, they’re not necessarily going to see the difference, because they’re not coming to the hospital every day. But that will be obviously an important difference. Some of the other things in terms of some of the businesses and whatnot, small steps, not terribly different from some of the other stuff we’ve done.
In fact, we’ve had retail open, Home Depot, all this. Obviously people have been going to grocery stores. So it’s designed that way. And I know there’s some folks who are saying, “Hey, just flip the switch, and just go be done with it.” But the country has never handled an epidemic like we handled this one, they didn’t in ’18, ’57, ’68, if you look at those pandemics. So nobody really knows, and anyone that tells you they know for sure, they’re not being honest. So I think that’s why being safe, smart and step-by-step is the appropriate way to consider that. And I think we’re going to respond well, and I think we’re going to be able to continue to take some good steps. But tomorrow’s just one step. It’s certainly not the Florida that we had in February, but I think that we obviously want to get get to where we’re back in the saddle doing a lot of great things. So thank you guys for all you’re doing, and I’ll be happy to take a few questions before I leave.
Well the Department of Education is DOE. They don’t do unemployment. That’s DEO. Yeah DEO. So what I’m going to do tomorrow is, we are going to do, my press conference is going to focus on everything having to do with this, and we’re going to run through, because I think, clearly you’re starting, I mean they’ve now processed 700 million, I think they’re at now, and they’re doing this all weekend. They’ve paid 450,000 claimants. Probably there’ll be more as we go in. And so I think people, it’s been very tough because it’s a sudden abrupt change in the economy. And I know this was very difficult for a lot of people. The system just totally broke. It’s not a good system. We’re going to deal with that, but we had to make all these changes in really just 24/7, so that money’s going out. I think the questions we get now more than anything is, “Hey, I applied, but I was deemed ineligible, or my application.” So they’re going to address that, and show kind of some of the different things that may be troubleshooting.
If you don’t qualify for unemployment benefits, if someone wasn’t working at all, or seeking employment, then they’re not going to qualify for unemployment. There are other forms of relief under the Federal Cares Act. So we’re going to outline all of that tomorrow, provide the most up to date statistics on how much money has been paid out, and hope to answer a lot of those questions. I’m going to have the secretary of DMS, who I put in, because we needed to get these changes done quicker, to run the unemployment. He’s going to be there, and I think people should tune in. I think that that will be very helpful, and I would say, the agency has been very proactive. If somebody is quoted in the newspaper saying, “Hey, I haven’t gotten my stuff.” They actually will go, and they will try to identify, okay, who’s the person? Look them up in the system, and see what the deal is.
And if they see somebody talking on even social media sometimes, they’ll find people, and they will go and do this. I can tell you most of the cases that they’re finding are no social security number, out of state… there’s just a bunch of different things. So I think it’s going to be helpful to just kind of do a big run through, let everyone know where we’re at. I think the progress, given how bad the system was, people have worked really hard. We still got more work to do, but I think it’ll be helpful. That’ll be tomorrow. And I think people, if they’re interested, should definitely tune in.
So we sourced from the FDA-approved test. I don’t know the company’s name, but I think they sent the test to New York first, and then they send it to us. The surgeon general of Florida was adamant that you only do FDA-approved, because what you’ll find is the COVID-19, to the virus that causes COVID-19 is a Coronavirus. It’s not the only Coronavirus. If the test doesn’t have the specificity, then I could test positive for antibodies for the common cold, for example. Well that obviously isn’t helping us identify this. So yeah, this is an FDA-approved test. It will distinguish, at least FDA says, between the Coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and other Coronaviruses. So that’s very important to do. We also have another company in Florida that we have an agreement with, that is waiting for the emergency use authorization from the FDA. Obviously we’re going to want to see that before we put that into practice, but it’s a very important thing. If you don’t have an antibody test that can distinguish the validity of what we can extrapolate from that, it’s just not there.
Well I think there’s more to that. I mean they’re really going through a lot. If you look at what they did with Remdisiver, that had been going on, and I’m not saying Remdisiver is going to be effective. If you look at what they did with some of these Abbott Lab tests, this is something that they do look at, but what they do is, anything with Coronavirus, they are fast-tracking. So if some reputable company has a new test, that is going to be reviewed immediately by the FDA, whereas normally, that would take forever and a day even to just get your foot in the door. So I really appreciate… Dr. Hahn, who’s the commissioner, has been really, really great to deal with. Anytime we have an issue, I can call him directly, and he’s very responsive, and he’s working really, really hard.
So I think they’re doing it the best way that they can. You obviously have to review this stuff. You can’t just willy-nilly say throw products out. At the same time, lives are at stake. And so if you let the bureaucracy grind this process to a halt, then you’re going to be missing opportunities to potentially help people. So I don’t think it’s any perfect solution, but I think they probably struck the balance as good as you can.
The Department of Health is working with OneBlood. As people give blood normally, we think that you’d be able to screen for the antibodies. So you may end up with a situation where X number of people have given from one part of the state, and we can see what percentage actually has the antibodies. That will be interesting from just a general societal perspective. It wouldn’t be a scientifically valid representative sample, but I think it would be an indication. So yeah, we’re going to do that as well. And I would also remind people out there, if you have had COVID, and you’ve recovered, and you give the blood, they can then use those antibodies for this plasma treatment, which a lot of physicians have had very good results with. So you have an opportunity to kind of help other people, who may develop this disease in the future, if you’re willing to donate the blood.
And then once we do the antibody testing, because a lot of the people, if you look at all those antibody results, the inescapable conclusion is, a lot of people have had this and don’t even know they’ve had it. Because they just either never developed symptoms at all, or the symptoms were so mild, it was not anything you would even think of. When you’re in Santa Clara and Stanford is saying 50 to 80 times more people have the antibodies, than have tested positive in Santa Clara, that obviously is really significant…
… Santa Clara, that obviously is really significant. New York, you look, I mean, they have more cases than anyone, documented cases, but I think there are 300 some thousand, but they have several million according to those antibodies, just in the city, I think, alone. So that’s really, really significant to know.
Right, but you have to also put that in perspective. We have two million more people than New York, for example, an older population. They’ve had thousands and thousands of nursing home deaths. So what we’ve done has been able to reduce what I think would be expected in terms of the fatalities significantly. Our death rate in longterm care facilities is way less than New York, New Jersey, all those other places, and many other places across the country.
There’s a couple problems. One is the screening that we put in immediately, not every facility followed it. So there were sick workers who were allowed to go in and do the work. Well, this is a contagious illness and so you ended up having outbreaks. Then we started to see asymptomatic staff members. They passed the screening, they didn’t have a fever. They necessarily didn’t have contact, at least known contact, with people who had it.
But then you’d go in a place, like Suwannee County had one, where you had dozens of staff and a lot of them didn’t even know they were sick and then that spreads to the residents. So one of the reasons we’re doing so much resources on National Guard for the nursing homes is we want to be able to identify people who are asymptomatic, identify who they’ve been working with, and then segregate that cluster so it doesn’t just continue to spread to the nursing homes.
We’ve done a bunch of testing. I think it’s been effective, but then with this RV to be able to go in a mobile way, run the test, get the results, and then immediately isolate any staff that may be infected, that’s a huge, huge force multiplier. So that’s going to be coming online in a few days. We’re going to do a big announcement for that.
If you look at the epidemic in Florida for certainly outside of Southeast Florida, and you look at the numbers where Volusia is, where Brevard, a lot of these places, Orlando, Orange County’s done a great job. The overwhelming threat is really in these longterm care facilities. It’s not permeating right now, knock on wood, hopefully that continues, to where you have this virulent infections like you would have in New Jersey or some of these other places.
So if the nursing homes, we can continue to do things there, that is going to be the tip of the sphere. And then yeah, I would say even in Southern Florida, it clearly has spread more in a place like Miami, but you still have a significant fraction of those fatalities are from those facilities. So very, very important.
But one thing that I would give our healthcare administration secretary, Mary Mayhew credit, she has been a hawk on this since the very beginning. I mean, before anyone was even talking about this, we understood this was where the vulnerability is, and she’s worked with the hospitals, she’s worked with the facilities, and really, really done well.
And also Jared Moskowitz, who’s the Director of Emergency Management. I told Jared, I said, “Look, obviously, if we have PPE, if a hospital worker needs it, we need to get them masks, we need to do all that.” I was like, “But we’ve also got to get stuff to these folks working in the nursing homes, because if you have protection of the staff and you prevent an outbreak, that’s going to take stress off the hospitals,” because you have an outbreak in a nursing home, you’re going to see people end up coming here and obviously that’s going to reduce their capacity.
Not that you want an outbreak anywhere, but you’re seeing places where you’re having outbreaks and 90% of the people are asymptomatic. In some of the younger cohorts, some of the prison populations that you’ve seen, very few have had symptoms. And so, the nursing home is really that, so we have sent out just from the state of Florida to longterm care facilities, seven million masks, a million gloves and half a million face shields just to those longterm care facilities. We’re requiring them to wear this stuff. A lot of them did have some, but they needed more. So we pushed out a lot and I think that that’s probably a very effective use of resources.
So what we’re going to do is we’re going to monitor the hospital capacity. The whole reason they did the mitigation was the fear of the hospitals being overwhelmed, and if that were to happen, that obviously would lead to really bad health outcomes, not just for COVID, but for every anything else.
So we are going to look to see, do you have a trend where hospitals are starting to get overburdened, and if that is tied to anything that we’re doing in terms of phase one. But I also want to see if there’s a connection to that. I mean, for example, I view the nursing home problem as separate from whether businesses can reopen because if you’re doing things in the nursing home, we know we have to keep people out of there. I mean we know that.
And so if there’s an outbreak there that may not be related to some of the other things that you’re doing. The other thing we’re going to look at, we’re going to expand, continue to expand, testing. As I’ve said repeatedly over the last week or so, this is just a fact, our drive through sites have fewer people go through than we have capacity to test by several thousand statewide. We could probably do another 2,500 statewide for that.
Now, hopefully that’s just because people aren’t having symptoms. Maybe that’s a really good sign, but we’re going to continue to expand opportunities. I do think you’re going to have more testing. I think more businesses are going to want to be involved. Obviously, I’ve talked about private sector, like Walgreens, so you’re going to start to get even more. We typically, if you look this past week, yesterday we got about 15,000 test results, the day before, almost 19,000, day before that 21,000. So we’re going to be in, I think, 20,000 to 30. I think we’ll have capacity do even more.
And there’s going to be more cases that are going to be found because we’re testing more asymptomatic people now. When this started, CDC said only test 65 and up who had traveled to China. I mean, it was so restrictive. They’ve loosened it, but we’ve loosened it even more and said, “Even if you don’t have symptoms, you can come get tested.”
So what that will do, that will allow us to identify infected people who are very low risk for hospitalization or fatalities. But that’s a good thing that we know that because that could be somebody that could spread it to one of the vulnerable populations. So we’re going to identify more cases as we go along and I can already tell people that’s going to probably be spun in the media as, “Oh my gosh, Florida just had … ” Like the other day they had 995 new Florida cases on 4/30.
Yeah, we tested 21,000 people that day and the percent positive was five. So we’re going to really be looking at that percent positive, making sure that that’s under 10%. Volusia is so low. I mean, when you’re in the 1.7, 1.4, 2.2, 2.2, 1.7, other than the prison positives, I don’t think Volusia’s been over 3% in about 10, 12 days. So that’s a really good sign. So looking at the percent that test positive and then looking at the hospitalizations.
And then we’ll also look at things like the syndromatic indicators. We’ll look at the influenza-like illness indicators and see how things are going. But fortunately, I think the trend certainly on the syndromatic indicators, has been very positive statewide. And we have so much hospital capacity statewide. I mean, even Miami, which has 40% of our cases, they’ve typically had between 40 and 45% of their ICU beds have been empty this whole time.
So we’re going to be looking at that, but I really believe that taking these smart, safe, and step-by-step approaches, it allows us to get the state back in a good direction without taking our eye off the ball with these vulnerable populations. And so all that continues, but I definitely think that you’re going to be able to do both.
So I look forward to coming back here soon. I mean, man, the Daytona, obviously, the race got suspended the day I was here. They had a great next day. We want to see Daytona back the way it was. It’s not going to happen overnight, but I’m confident that we can get there. So everyone just hang in there and do your part. Thank you.
",Florida Governor Ron DeSantis COVID-19 Briefing May 3,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/florida-governor-ron-desantis-covid-19-briefing-may-3
Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2007-11-01,"Well, I'll tell you, I know how we're going to solve the energy crisis.
We're all going to do it together. This wonderful hall that has meant so much to me over so many years, the site of a lot of great memories for me is a place that I return to with so much love and affection.
And standing up here with my -- looking out at all of you is just an overwhelming experience. I am so grateful to be here.
I also want to thank the students from all of the colleges and universities. I know we have students from B.U. and Harvard and Yale and Brown and others...
... who have traveled to be here. And welcome to Wellesley and welcome to this event. It's not exactly a mixer, but I hope you get to meet each other.
That meant two out of four feet had to be on the floor at all times. Try it sometime.
Now, that is a rule that I and many of my classmates became actually nostalgic for when we had college aged children of our own. But while times have clearly changed, what makes this college special has endured.
The world class faculty and staff who push you and challenge you, those late nights and long lunches where you challenge each other and learn from each other, the camaraderie that develops when smart, ambitious young women come together in a community of learning.
In so many ways, this all women's college prepared me to compete on the all boys' club of presidential politics.
This was a place where you could try out all different kinds of leadership styles, where you could ask for critique and support from your friends and the faculty with whom you had an ongoing relationship. It was a place that truly did prepare women to make the best choices that we thought were right for our own lives.
I have to tell you, though, when I came to Wellesley, I never in a million years could have imagined I would one day return as a candidate for the presidency of the United States. Back then, I didn't even know for sure I would return for my sophomore year.
I had grown up in the Midwest, outside of Chicago.
I had serious doubts about this whole going east for college idea and just one month after I moved into my room in Stone Davis, I felt...
... I felt like all my worst fears had been confirmed. So many of my classmates had traveled the world. They learned and spoke multiple languages. I was struggling in my classes, in fact, to the point where my French professor said to me, ""Mademoiselle, your talents lie elsewhere.""
And I called home. In those days, you called collect. And my parents took the call, which was a good thing, and I said I just didn't think that I could do this. It wasn't for me.
Now, my father said that was just fine. I think he missed me. But my mother, who never got to go to college, would not hear a word of it. She said, ""Hillary, I don't want you to be a quitter,"" to which I'm embarrassed to admit I responded, ""All right. But if I don't like it at the end of the year, can I quit then?""
Well, I stuck it out and I am so glad I did, because my four years here were among the most exhilarating and informative of my life. And the friends that I made here have been the friends of a lifetime. They have sustained and supported me every step of the way on my journey, as I have tried to do for them.
And we started that journey at a tumultuous time in our nation's history. We were embroiled in a war that many of us opposed. Here at home, so many of our fellow citizens were marginalized and denied their most basic rights.
We were uneasy about our future, uncertain about America's role in the world, and unwilling to trust a government that didn't share our values.
Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?
But we were inspired by our Wellesley motto not to be ministered onto, but to minister, and we took it to heart, probably more than some of our professors and administrators at the time would have liked.
We protested the Vietnam War. We marched for civil rights. We fought to bring more minority students and faculty to Wellesley. And at the end of our four years, my classmates convinced our skeptical college president, Ruth Adams, to have the first ever student speaker at graduation and then they convinced me to do the honors.
Well, when the time came, President Adams introduced me as, and I quote, ""cheerful, good humored, good company, and a good friend to all of us."" I'm afraid she probably wanted to take it all back once I opened my mouth.
My thoughts on the indispensable task for criticizing and constructive protest wasn't exactly her idea of a commencement speech. Now, when I go back and read it today, I have to admit, it wasn't the world's most coherent address and I sort of cringe when I read that I actually said things like ""coming to terms with our humanness and authentic reality and inauthentic reality.""
I tell you, Wellesley gets into you and...
But I still believe as strongly today as I did then in my statement that politics is the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. That is what I have believed ever since I was a student here. That's what I have tried to do throughout my life, starting after law school, as when Maya said, I didn't want to go to work for a law firm, I didn't want to clerk for a judge.
I went to work instead for the Children's Defense Fund and my first assignment there was trying to figure out what we could do to get more kids into school.
I went to New Bedford, Massachusetts to try to figure out why there were so many children in the census who didn't appear on any school enrollment forms. And I went door to door and in home after home, I found children who were blind or deaf or in wheelchairs. They were kept home because the schools wouldn't or couldn't accommodate them.
They wanted to learn. They wanted to succeed. But they never had the chance. I knew then that I wanted to spend my career being a voice for children, children particularly who had been left behind, children who drew the short straw in life.
I wanted to fight to give them the same opportunities that I had growing up. And like many of my classmates and many of you, I did want to make a difference. Now, that wasn't always easy. Back then, women weren't always taken seriously back then.
When I was first deciding where to attend law school, I was invited to go, after I had been admitted to Harvard and Yale, to a cocktail reception for prospective students at the Harvard Law School and I knew a couple of the male students who were there and they were showing me around.
And we ran right into Professor Paper Chase, large, imposing, three-piece suit, watch chain, looking down at everyone, and one of my friends said, ""Professor so-and-so, this is Hillary Rodham. She's trying to decide between us and our nearest competitor.""
And he looked down at me and he said, ""Well, first of all, we don't have a nearest competitor.""
And, secondly, we don't need any more women."" So I decided to go to Yale.
There were 235 students, of whom just 27 were women, and today women are the majority of students in law schools.
As a young lawyer, when I once told a colleague that I wanted to practice litigation courtroom law, he replied that this was clearly impossible, because I didn't have a wife.
He asked me...
He asked me, totally seriously, ""When you're in a long trial and you're so busy, who will make sure you have clean socks for court?""
I had honestly never thought about that.
I had always washed my own socks. And I have been thrilled to see women serving across America not only in the legal profession, but the medical profession, in academia and so much else.
But back then, the idea of a woman running for president would have been greeted with derisive laughter.
Well, times have changed. Despite the challenges we faced, we have found ways to serve our country in every way imaginable, in our professions, our communities and our families.
And looking at your generation, I see that same desire to give back. We saw it especially after September 11. While the president didn't ask us to do anything, except go shopping, which hardly ranks up there as a call to action and sacrifice from an American president, the young people of our country had other ideas.
Between 2000 and 2006, applications to teach for America nearly tripled. Between 2004 and 2006 alone, applications to the Americorps Vista program jumped 50 percent. And in recent years, the Peace Corps has seen the highest number of volunteers in three decades.
We've seen a resurgence of activism on college campuses. Students are Brown have created a sustainable foods initiative, organizing farmers' markets and convincing dining halls to switch to local foods.
Students at Keane State College in New Hampshire hosted a concert to raise money for victims of the genocide in Darfur.
Students at the University of New Hampshire are working to protect our environment by reducing energy and water use on campus.
And here at Wellesley, just recently, students organized a day of awareness and a rally to protest the unfair treatment of the Jena 6. They've also traveled to New Orleans to help rebuild after Hurricane Katrina and...
... I especially want to thank you for working together through a group called Sisters Keepers to help student mothers finish their education.
And to those who might sometimes here on television say that your generation is disengaged, that you're not as passionate and committed as we were, I say come to Providence, come to Keane, come to Durham, come to Wellesley, travel across our country, take the same opportunity that I've had to actually meet and talk with the young people of America, see how every day you're standing up, taking charge and making the impossible possible.
Unfortunately, for nearly seven years, we've had a president who hasn't been much of a partner in your work. If anything, he's actually created more work. He's undermined women's right and gay rights and appointed Supreme Court justices who chipped away at reproductive rights, undermined equal pay, and turned back the clock on school integration, decisions that will affect you and your children for decades to come.
He's continued to wage a war in Iraq that has taken more than 3,800 of our best and most dedicated young men and women and costs us more than $300 million a day, a bill that, again, you and your children will be paying, unless we reverse course.
He's run up our national debt to $9 trillion. So every baby born today starts life with $30,000 of debt on his or her tiny shoulders, a birth tax that will only increase for your children and grandchildren if we don't end this reckless spending.
He's waged a war on science, cutting off promising stem cell research, banning his own surgeon general from talking about contraception, failing to address the threat of global warming, that we know not only could, but is leading to increased storms and floods and heat waves and droughts, affecting millions of people across America and the world.
To paraphrase one of my most recent opponents, the philosopher, Stephen Colbert...
... this administration doesn't make decisions based on facts, it makes facts based on decisions.
As a result, my generation is in danger of being the first ever to leave America worse off than when we found it. And whether you're a Democrat or Republican, Independent, or you don't even care about politics, I think we can all agree that your generation, my daughter's generation deserves better than that.
The challenges you face today are no less profound than ones faced by previous generations of Americans and you deserve a president who will meet those challenges head on, a president who is committed to your future, a president who will never again play politics with women's health and women's rights, who will never again...
... who will never again put ideology over science and the cures and breakthroughs of the future, who will never again engage in reckless spending and stick you with the bill, who will confront the challenges that we face without fear or fear-mongering and leave America better off.
If you give me the chance and the honor, I will be that president for you.
I will start by making college affordable again so that middle class and hardworking families can go.
Back when I went to college, my father told me, ""Here's the deal. Got enough money for your tuition and board, but anything beyond that, like buying books, you pay for yourself."" And I had worked summers and holidays since I was 13, so I was fine with that.
But when I decided to go to law school and I told my father, he said, ""Well, you're on your own for that one. That wasn't part of the deal.""
So I kept working and I got a scholarship from Wellesley, the Vida Dutton Scudder scholarship, and I borrowed money from the federal government at a low interest rate. I didn't have to worry about some for-profit student loan company ripping me and my family off, raising the interest rates or changing the terms of the loan.
I didn't get stuck with a massive debt that would have derailed my dreams of a career in public service. When I'm president, I will restore that basic bargain. I proposed a new college tax credit that will cover more than 50 percent of the typical cost of public colleges and universities or the full cost of tuition for community colleges.
And for those who don't go to college, I think we should invest more in apprenticeships and job training and lifelong learning opportunities. There are so many...
There's so many hardworking young Americans, I think you probably know as many as I do, who don't go to college, but who deserve to have a shot at a high wage, high skill job, and we're going to have a lot of shortages in high skill jobs.
So we need to start doing more for them, as well. Let's start creating those jobs by investing in a new, clean energy industry and addressing the threat of global warming right now.
We all know the science. There's no longer a debate. Global warming is real. It's one of the greatest environmental, economic and international security threats we face, and I was, as I'm sure all of you were, so proud of Vice President Gore when he got the Nobel Prize for raising the alarm about global warming.
But we need a policy and that is what I will do as president. I'll create a $1 billion green building fund to build and renovate public buildings. We'll make buildings green and energy efficient. I want to establish a strategic energy fund paid for by a $50 billion investment in clean, renewable technologies by taking away the tax subsidies from the oil companies. They don't need them to make a profit.
Next week I'll be unveiling a broad agenda to address our energy and global warming challenges and I'll be talking a lot more about those issues all next week.
But today's challenges aren't just at home. We have to face those in order to make sure we have a strong and prosperous middle class. That has been the engine of economic growth in our country.
That's why we have to tackle energy. That's why we have to make college affordable. That's why we have to have an education system that starts with universal pre-kindergarten, that fixes the unfunded mandate of No Child Left Behind.
And that's why, finally, we need a health care system that provides quality, affordable health care for every single American.
But we know that our challenges are not just here at home. After nearly seven years of a stubborn, preemptive, go-it-alone foreign policy, we have our work cut out for us to restore our leadership around the world.
That starts with bringing our troops home from Iraq as responsibly and quickly as we can.
There is no military solution and we should not be asking our brave young men and women to serve as referees in their sectarian conflicts. It has to be done as carefully as possible, because it is dangerous withdrawing troops.
I've laid out may plans to bring our troops home from Iraq and demand that the Iraqis take responsibility for their own country, replace our military involvement with an intensive diplomatic initiative in the area.
And let me be clear, if George Bush doesn't end this war while he is president, when I am president, I will as quickly as I can.
But, unfortunately, our problems go far beyond Iraq. Take out the globe and look at it. We have alienated our friends and emboldened our enemies across the world. I have said I won't even wait until I'm inaugurated. The day after I'm elected, I will ask distinguished Americans of both parties to travel around the world with a new message, the era of cowboy diplomacy is over. We're going to start working with people again.
And, you know, I have come to a rather obvious conclusion based on my Wellesley education. You can't be a leader in the world if no one is following. And we have got to get back to leading, leading with our values, leading with moral authority, leading on behalf of bringing the world together, because when it comes to the challenges we face from global terrorism to global warming to global epidemics and global competition, we cannot do this all on our own.
And I want to lead the world to end the genocide in Darfur and we need to act immediately. Every day we fail to act is a betrayal of our common values.
As president, I will speed the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force. I will provide them with more support to do the job we're asking them to do and create real consequences for anyone who continues the bloodshed or obstructs the peace process.
We need to lead the world...
... to stop the brutal violence in Burma and insist that the regime release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi.
We need to lead the world in fighting the AIDS epidemic that is creating a global generation of orphans and destabilizing countries. That's why I was proud to sign the pledge to invest $50 billion by 2013 to combat AIDS across the world. We need to lead the world...
We need to lead the world in standing up for women's rights. Twelve years ago, when the U.N. convened a historic conference on women in Beijing, I was proud to represent our country and proclaim to the world that women's rights are human rights, because when women...
... when women continue to be raped as a casualty of conflict, trafficked for commercial advantage, denied education and health care and family planning, not given access to credit, denied their rights as citizens, that not only affects them and their countries, that compromises the dignity and the human rights of the entire human family.
If we don't stand for women's rights, we will never stand for our best values. That has to be a part of American foreign policy.
We need to lead the world in providing opportunity to the world's children, because when 100 million children in the developing world don't attend school and 150 million more drop out before finishing first grade, that is a recipe for poverty, extremism and instability.
That's why I've introduced the bipartisan Education for All Act, $10 billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world.
And, finally, we need to lead the world by living up to our values here at home. As we seek to promote the rule of law in other nations, we must accept it for ourselves. As we counsel liberty and justice for all, we cannot support torture and the indefinite detention of people we declare to be beyond the law.
I realize this is an ambitious agenda. Would you expect anything less from a Wellesley woman?
And I know I can't do it alone. I need your help. I am thrilled that we are launching 120 student chapters on college campuses across America today. We have a new Web site called Hillblazers at Www.Hillblazers.Com to help young people get organized.
And in the coming weeks, I need your help to make the calls, to knock on the doors and organize the events and talk to your friends and family. That's what I did back in 1968, when a group of my dear friends and I jumped in a car that one of us finagled to have on campus, and we would drive from Wellesley to Manchester, New Hampshire, stuffing envelopes and walking the precincts for Eugene McCarthy.
He was running for president on a platform of ending the Vietnam War. I am running for president, in part, on a platform to end the war in Iraq and most important of all, I need your help on election day. I need you to get the vote out and get your friends registered so they can vote.
In 2004, while the voter turnout rate for 18- to 34-year-olds was higher than in 2000, more than 25 million still never cast their votes, enough to possibly change the course of history.
For so long, young people have been ignored and silenced by others. Today, too many young people silence themselves. It's up to all of you to change that.
I know that politics can be frustrating, but it seems like we get bogged down in distractions and trivialization, who's up and who's down, people's hairstyle or their laugh or what they're wearing rather than what they're saying.
But in those moments when you think you're never going to break through the noise and you just want to give up, I urge you to think about all of the people who came before you. Many of them, we'll never know their names. They're lost to history. But so many others, we can read their stories, be amazed at their strength and their courage.
Think about those audacious women and a few brave men who gathered in Seneca Falls, New York for the declaration to issue the very first statement ever in the history of the world calling for women's full equality.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the key organizers, was just 32 years old. One attendee was just 15. It took more than 70 years for them to win the vote, more than 70 years of protesting, organizing, lobbying, going to jail, doing hunger strikes, chaining themselves to the gate in front of the White House, but they never gave up.
And just one woman from the Seneca Falls Convention lived long enough to actually cast a ballot.
Think about the civil rights movement. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was just 26 years old when he led the Montgomery bus boycott. My dear friend, Congressman John Lewis, was just 25 when he led that historic march across the bridge in Selma, a march that ended with teargas, hoses and the crack of night sticks against and his and others' skulls, as the marchers knelt down to pray.
Think about that. They were attacked as they knelt down to pray. They were, as Congressman Lewis put it later, using our bodies as a witness to the truth and they forced America to bear witness, as well.
They were willing to put their lives on the line and together they made the impossible possible.
I stand here today because of those brave men and women and I am inspired every day by the people I meet on the campaign trial. You know, the mothers and fathers who lift their little girls on their shoulders or lean over and whisper in their ears, ""See, honey, in America, you can be anything you want to be.""
The women in their 90s who come to my events, they stand there, they hold themselves up in a walker, they may be in a wheelchair, and as I meet them, they tell me, ""I was born before women could vote and I want to live long enough to see a woman in the White House.""
I know the challenges...
I know the challenges we face are daunting, but I still believe what I said in my commencement speech nearly 40 years ago. Fear is always with us, but we just don't have time for it, not now. So let's roll up our sleeves and get to work together.
We're ready to shatter that highest glass ceiling. It's what Americans have been doing for more than 200 years. It's what I believe has created the space for the transformative changes that we have been the beneficiaries of.
I think we're ready for that kind of change again. Change is just a word if you don't have the strength and experience to make it happen. I believe I do and I believe together we can make it.
We can make history. I like to think that it will be young people driven by Dr. King's fierce urgency of now who will make the difference in this election, because when I am president, my presidency is about your future. It is about what you will have to make your lives, to make your choices however you choose, to be responsible for yourselves, those whom you love, your communities, our country and the world.
There's a lot of work to do and I hope you will join me in doing that work.
Thank you all very, very much.
",Remarks on Student Activism at Wellesley College,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-student-activism-wellesley-college
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-12-26,"Well, first of all, at ease. At ease. Let's have a good time. Let's have a good time. And we had an incredible meeting that lasted for about an hour, and you have no idea what we've come up with. You're going to be so happy. You're going to be so happy. I want to just first say thank you for everything. And, on behalf of Melania and myself, we had a great flight in. So I want to thank you, honey. Come say hello, honey. Say hello.
. She's great. A very popular First Lady and a great person. And I want to thank General LaCamera for the incredible job he's done. And I was just saying, we had a meeting with him and some of your great representatives, and we have some ideas, that are more than ideas, that are going to be just -- we like to win.
Do we like to win? We're going to win.  I want to thank everyone at Al Asad Air Base. Special people. We came in, we were -- we felt very safe coming in. It was a pretty difficult journey in certain ways, but we felt very, very good; very safe. And also we knew exactly where we were going, and we're going to say hello to you and wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
Very important. Thank you very much. Great job. So Melania and I are thrilled to be here with the extraordinary men and women of the American Armed Forces -- the greatest military, and -- especially as we get all of this billions and billions of dollars of new equipment that I approved over the last two years.
You're getting such new equipment, your eyes are popping, right?  Your eyes are popping. You're getting the best equipment in the world. As you know, it was being very rapidly depleted, and it wasn't good. And we weren't going to let that happen to you or to our country. And I just want you to relax. Let's have a good time for a few minutes, and then I'll be heading to another location, and then I'll be heading back.
But I have you totally in mind -- totally in mind. We came to Al Asad to share our eternal gratitude for everything you do to keep America safe, strong, and free. Though you are thousands of miles away from your home and your loved ones, I hope you all had a merry Christmas. I also know that, speaking for your families, they are missing you and they love you.
And you know they're every bit a part of your success; they make it possible. So they're very special to us, all of the families. It's because of your sacrifice that America's families can celebrate in safety and in peace. And we're doing great back at home. There are many incredible patriots to recognize here, right now.
And I'd like to start by saying a few words for Colonel Michael Maddox. Colonel, thank you very much.  Thank you, Colonel. Great job. Thank you, Colonel. No games. I can see -- I know people. No games for the Colonel. No games with your general, right? Not a lot of games. It's called, ""They want to win."" I want to thank the 201st Regional Support Group.
One that everybody knows of, even back in the States: Task Force Thunder and their Lieutenant Colonel Kent Park.  There's a reason for that name, ""Thunder,"" isn't there?  The 443rd Air Expeditionary Squadron and their great commander, Major Dicie Hritz. Where is Dicie?  Thank you. Great, fellas. Great. The 1st Expeditionary Rescue Group and their commander, Colonel Michael Guischard.
Where is Michael? Thank you. Thank you, fellas. The 3rd Cavalry Regiment and their commander, Colonel Jonathan Byrom.  Brigadier General Austin Renforth. Where is Austin? Austin.  Thank you, Austin. Thanks, Austin. Everyone at the Special Operations Joint Task Force. Thank you. Where the hell are they.
You know that that means -- Camp Havoc. Also joining us this evening is the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Douglas Silliman. Douglas, thank you very much. Great job, Douglas. Great job.  The courageous men and women at Al Asad Air Base are on the leading edge of our fight to vanquish America's terrorist enemies.
You know that. The other reason I'm here today is to personally thank you and every service member throughout this region for the near elimination of the ISIS territorial caliphate in Iraq and in Syria.  Two years ago, when I became President, they were a very dominant group. They were very dominant. Today, they're not so dominant anymore.
Great job. I looked at a map, and two years ago it was a lot of red all over that map. But now you have a couple little spots. And that's happening very quickly. That's happening very quickly. You'll be seeing that. I want to just say great job. And we'll be watching ISIS very closely. We'll be watching them very, very closely -- the remnants of ISIS.
No enemy on Earth can match the awesome strength of American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. Nobody is even close. And nobody is even close, in terms of our equipment. We make the greatest equipment in the world. Whether it's missiles or ships or anything you want to name, we have the greatest in the world.
The jet fighters, the new F-35, the Super F-18s -- we have the greatest fighter jets in the world. We make the greatest equipment in the world. But you strike fear into the hearts of our enemies and bring comfort to all of our allies and those who cherish peace. And we want peace. And the best way to have peace is strength.
When we're strong, we're going to have peace. If we're not strong, you know what happens. So we're stronger than ever. And very soon, when it all comes in, when that equipment keeps flowing -- it's being made, much of it now -- there will be nobody ever in history that's even close. American and coalition forces have had one military victory after another over the last two years against ISIS, including the retaking of both Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.
We've liberated more than 20,000 square miles of territory. Think of what that is -- 20,000. Twenty thousand acres is a lot; think of what twenty thousand square miles is. It's a lot. This was all formerly held by ISIS -- and liberated more than 3 million civilians from ISIS's bloodthirsty control. The men and women stationed at Al Asad have played a vital role in the military defeat of ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.
Because of these gains, our service members in Syria can now return home to their families. Some will come here for a stay, but a lot of them are going to be going back home, where they want to be, with their families. They've done a fantastic job. Originally, years ago, they came here. And it was supposed to be for three to four months, and that was a long time ago.
That was many years ago. But what a job you have done. What a job they have done. I made it clear from the beginning that our mission in Syria was to strip ISIS of its military strongholds; we're not nation building. Rebuilding Syria will require a political solution. And it's a solution that should be paid for by its very rich neighboring countries, not the United States.
Let them pay for it. And they will. They will. In fact, Saudi Arabia yesterday -- you probably read -- stepped up to the plate and has already made a commitment of substantial funds for development. And President Erdogan of Turkey has also agreed to take out any remnants of ISIS, and we'll be working with them.
We're going to be working with them. Our presence in Syria was not open-ended, and it was never intended to be permanent. Eight years ago, we went there for three months, and we never left. But now we're doing it right, and we're going to finish it off. One year ago, I gave our generals six more months in Syria.
I said, ""Go ahead. Get them."" And it turns out it was really a year and a half ago. I said, ""Go get them."" ""We need six months."" ""Go get them."" Then they said, ""Give us another six months."" I said, ""Go get them."" Then they said ""Go -- can we have one more, like, period of six months?"" I said, ""Nope. Nope."" I said, ""I gave you a lot of six months."" And now we're doing it a different way.
And we're doing it. And you're doing it, folks. You're doing it. Just the remnants. The men and women who serve are entitled to clear objectives, and the confidence that when those objectives are met they can come home and be with their families. Our objective in Syria was always to retake the territory controlled by ISIS.
Some people said we've already retaken 99 percent. That's a number that comes up a lot. And if you look at the map, before and after, it looks like 99 percent. Now that we have done so, the nations of the region must step up and take more responsibility for their future. And also, they have to confront those remnants of ISIS and take them out very easily -- if, after we're totally finished, they're even left at all.
There will be a strong, deliberate, and orderly withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria -- very deliberate, very orderly -- while maintaining the U.S. presence in Iraq to prevent an ISIS resurgence and to protect U.S. interests, and also to always watch very closely over any potential reformation of ISIS and also to watch over Iran.
We'll be watching. While American might can defeat terrorist armies on the battlefield, each nation of the world must decide for itself what kind of future it wants to build for its people, and what kind of sacrifices they are willing to make for their children. America shouldn't be doing the fighting for every nation on Earth not being reimbursed, in many cases, at all.
If they want us to do the fighting, they also have to pay a price -- and sometimes that's also a monetary price -- so we're not the suckers of the world. We're no longer the suckers, folks. And people aren't looking at us as suckers. And I love you folks because most of you are nodding your head this way.
We're respected again as a nation. We're respected again. America is safer, and peace is more possible because of the incredible courage and devotion of every patriot here tonight. Some people say, ""Well, maybe somebody comes from the area, and they hit us on our homeland."" If that happens, they will suffer consequences over here like nobody has ever suffered before.
Let me just tell you. And I hope they hear that loud and clear. And that's not a threat; that's going to be a fact. If anything should happen at all, nobody will ever have suffered the consequences that they will suffer. Just remember I said it.
We will honor -- you're welcome. You're welcome. And that includes the strengthening of our borders. I don't know if you folks are aware of what's happening.
We want to have strong borders in the United States. The Democrats don't want to let us have strong borders -- only for one reason. You know why? Because I want it. You're warriors.
You know, you're modern-day warriors. That's what you are. But you gave me an idea, just looking at this warrior group. I think I'll say, ""I don't want the wall."" And then they're going to give it to me."" ""Oh, we want the wall."" And then we get the wall.
That's another way of doing it.  That's another way of doing it. No, we have to have it. And, you know, not only human trafficking; drugs; illegals; a lot of criminals -- bad records. We've seen murderers come in through the -- you saw what happened with the caravan, as we call it. A caravan of thousands of people.
And, by the way, our Border Patrol did an incredible job, and our military did an incredible job. And local law enforcement on the various parts of the border did an incredible job. And those caravans are slowly breaking up, and they're going back where they came from, and they have to come into our country legally.
Legally. And that's what you're fighting for. You know, when you think about it, you're fighting for borders in other countries, and they don't want to fight -- the Democrats -- for the border of our country. It doesn't make a lot of sense. At this sacred time of the year, our thoughts turn to the American heroes who gave their last breath in defense of our country, including the seven brave souls who perished last March on the Jolly 51 rescue helicopter.
You know exactly who we're talking about. Some of you were great friends of theirs. Through their incredible sacrifice, our fallen heroes have achieved immortality. That's what it is; it's immortality. Immortality. They will live forever in the hearts of their countrymen, in your hearts, and in the history of the United States of America.
They will live forever. The dignity and glory of the American warrior is recorded on the fields of battle and in acts of valor that will live for all of time. You're going to be remembered for all of time. And under my administration, we're winning now. We're not playing to lose slowly, like they've been doing for 19 years.
We're fighting in areas where we shouldn't be fighting, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars doing it. No. You have the right thought process now going, for the first time in a long time. We want to fight where it's meaningful, which is basically what you're just saying.
And you understand that better than anybody. The people in this room understand that better. Your general understands it. I just met with them. Your general understands it. We want to fight for the meaningful things. No force in history has done more for the cause of justice and peace. I want each and every one of you to know that we will always protect those who protect us. You protect us. We are always going to protect you.
And you just saw that because you just got one of the biggest pay raises you've ever received -- unless you don't want it.  Does anybody here -- is anybody here willing to give up the big pay raise you just got? Raise your hands, please. Ah, I don't see too many hands. Okay, don't give it up. It's great.
You know what? Nobody deserves it more. You haven't gotten one in more than 10 years -- more than 10 years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one. I got you a big one.  They had plenty of people that came up. They said, ""You know, we could make it smaller. We could make it 3 percent. We could make it 2 percent.
We could make it 4 percent."" I said, ""No. Make it 10 percent. Make it more than 10 percent."" Because it's been a long time. It's been more than 10 years. It's been more than 10 years. That's a long time. And, you know, you really put yourselves out there, and you put your lives out there. So congratulations.
We're fighting every day to ensure you have also the tools, the equipment, the training, and resources that you need to fight and to win. We don't play ""prevent defense"" anymore. We're not doing that. That's why, when you see me doing things, I always have things in mind. I always have lots of things in mind -- things that you have in mind, too, but a lot of other people don't. A lot of the media doesn't want to report it correctly, but we have a lot of things in mind.
But do you ever see at -- like, in football, where a team is holding the other team scoreless -- they can't throw; they can't pass; they can't do anything. Now it's three and a half quarters; they got to just hold them. And they say, ""Let's change to prevent defense."" And that's what happens. And you know what it does?
It prevents them from winning. How many times have you seen that? We don't like prevent defense. We want real offense and we want real defense. And that's what we're doing. We have secured a record increase to our military budget, and we are purchasing all of this great equipment -- $700 billion last year; $716 billion -- with a ""b,"" with a ""b."" We were fought very hard by the Democrats and others.
But I said, ""We have to take care of our military."" I mean, I want to see costs come down, too. But not when it comes to our military. You have to have the finest equipment anywhere in the world, and you have that -- $716 billion. And this year, again, we're going to be -- don't tell anybody because nobody else knows -- even a little bit higher.
But we have no choice. We can't play cheap with our warriors or military. We can't play cheap with victory. And we're not going to. We understand the best way to preserve the peace is to be prepared for combat, and the surest way to prevent conflict is to be totally unyielding and totally ready for conflict if that should happen.
America is a peace-loving nation. But rest assured, if we are forced to fight, we will engage the enemy with overwhelming force like never before -- like nobody has ever seen before.  There is no military more capable and, now, more lethal, more fearless, and more skilled than the United States Armed Forces.
Nobody is even close. Our faith and confidence in you is absolute and total. You are the sentinels who watch over our nation. You are the warriors who defend our freedom. You are the patriots who ensure the flame of liberty burns forever bright. That's who you are. That's who you are. To everyone at Al Asad Air Base, and every American serving overseas, may God bless you, may God protect you, and may God always keep you safe.
We love you. We support you. We salute you. We cherish you. And together, we pray for justice, goodness, and peace on Earth. We are putting America first, for the first time in a long time -- longer than anyone can remember. At the same time, we're here to help others. And for all of you that have those red caps -- and I saw them before; I signed a lot of them -- it says, ""Make America Great Again."" And you know what?
That's exactly what we're doing. So we flew all night on Christmas evening -- the First Lady, myself, John Bolton, and a lot of other great people on that plane. Thank you, John. And it was worth every minute of it. And I just want to thank you. You are outstanding, outstanding people. And we will never let you down. Just remember that. God bless America. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Speaks to Troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-troops-holiday-visit-iraq-december-26-2018
David Blunkett,United Kingdom,2016-03-31,"Well firstly my appreciation for organising this evening and to all of you for coming. I’m going to have a go tonight to look more thoughtfully at some of the larger issues, not in order to pick out a single issue and make it the theme but to try and look at where we are in terms of race, race equality, its relationship to economic migration, the modernisation agenda and what it means in the 21st century. And I hope that people will bear with me in doing that.
The first thing to say is that I think we’ve made the most enormous progress over a 40-50 year period. For very many younger people, the memories of the 1960s will be non-existent. But it is worth just reminding ourselves that in 1965 a by-election was fought on race in Smethwick. That the inflamed passions in the West Midlands at the time particularly, centred on Wolverhampton and Enoch Powell – one of the constituency MPs as well as being a very clever, very intellectual Cabinet Minister who became obsessed with the notion that a flow of people whose skin colour, whose race, whose religion was different, posed a major problem to social cohesion and to the integration of our society.
And it’s worth just reflecting now that – Raj Paul, Lord Paul, is the Chancellor of Wolverhampton University as he was reminding me yesterday – that the most overt indications of racism, the “no blacks”, “no Asians”, “no Irish” outside hotels has thankfully gone mainly because of the 1976 Race Relations Act as well as a change in attitude and perception; that there are new and very different challenges that are not as obvious but nevertheless can be as assiduous and dangerous to people as those more overt racist indications.
And perhaps, even, if you go back to before even I was born, all those ancient years ago, to hear the story of Satchmo, Louis Armstrong, who spent a whole afternoon and evening trying to find a London hotel who would take him because he was black. Now that’s the reality of the world as it was, and I want to just reflect just a little on the world as it is today.
The world today still poses major challenges to us as a nation, not simply in examining our own conscience and what we do. I went through the mid 80s fighting a whole industry that grew up, an anti-racist industry where people were almost put through psychotherapy. They had to admit they were racist before they could truly be saved. And we had the most bizarre incidents when I was leader of Sheffield where we were trying to build a non-racist society, where we were the only major city in the country that did not have riots in 1981, because people actually did work from the beginning together to try and overcome difficulties, where we didn’t actually say “look, we’ll do this for you” but we actually engaged and provided the resource for the Afro-Caribbean community to build their own major centre and activity inside it. But where we still had gesturism writ large. For instance it came to my attention from a local journalist that one of the Sub-Committees was about to take an official report that suggested that the Council banned the term “black” on the grounds that it was racist and offensive. So black was going to be taken out of “blackboard” or “blackball” or just about anything. I don’t know how they were going to take it out of Blackburn but they were going to take the word “black”.
I rang a number of Afro-Caribbean colleagues of mine and said to them “I’m about to denounce this as a piece of arrant liberal middle-class nonsense. What do you feel?” and they said “Well thank God, because if you don’t, the ridicule, the disdain, the misunderstanding, the ability of racists to misuse it, will make our lives a misery” and I took immediate action. This was before the election of Executive Mayors you understand, but in those days you could get away with some things so long as they were common sense, and withdrew the report and the action. And the letters I got from a vast number of black and Asian residents, citizens in Sheffield, saying “Thank God you were able to take that action” encouraged me to believe that what we actually need to do is to address real issues, to tackle racism head on, to be prepared to open up transparently difficult questions but to try and do so in a way that makes progress, that takes us forward rather than backwards and that in the end is seen as changing people’s attitudes and perspectives. And that’s what I’m trying to do as Home Secretary.
Now I don’t pretend for a moment that I don’t make mistakes. I don’t pretend for a moment that some of the things that I say and do can be misinterpreted. But I would claim that progress is made by addressing, not ducking, issues and that if we can balance what we’re doing in a way that makes sense to the majority of people, we can take them with us.
The first thing I want to say, therefore, this evening, really is – that I don’t believe the majority of people in Britain are racist. Nor do I believe that it is helpful to offload personal responsibility onto institutions and organisations. There is no question whatsoever that historic structures and built-in prejudice reflects itself in the operation of institutions in a way that has to be challenged. No question about that. And the Lawrence Report – the third Annual Report on the Steering Group’s activities is published today – has made a very critical contribution to challenging how those structures have developed and how the way in which people operate and work, their attitudes and actions often reflect what has been structured and built in, to their work.
But unless individuals at every level, including Senior Managers, accept that it is their responsibility to do something dramatic about what they find, then we offload the responsibility into some sort of amorphous hole – “it’s the system that does it”. Now the number of times I used to hear that in the past when revolution was just around the corner where, if only we could overturn the system the world would be a wonderful place. If I could have had the number of hot dinners I heard that in the 1970s and 80s, I’d have been even fatter than Ministers get today! And the truth is, that we all, all of us, have to accept responsibility for our actions, for our attitudes, and for what we do about it.
So the message this evening is that there is a clear set of responsibilities on everyone, to share the problem and to be part of the solution. And that is true of different communities within our society. It’s of course true of, what, just for the sake of ease I will call a host community, where people have been settled for a very large period of time in terms of attitudes, in terms of actions, in terms of the way they see the world around them. But it’s also true of those coming into a country, accepting and developing their sense of belonging and identity and developing nationhood.
One of the encouraging things over the last few weeks, I don’t wish to exaggerate it, is that the flags – Union and St George’s – have actually been seen as a unifying force in terms of people during the Jubilee and the World Cup actually being able to come together and celebrate in a non-racist, non-jingoistic fashion and we need to get a hold of that very quickly and be able to build on it. It sets aside the use of the flag by the BNP and the National Front and jingoists in a deeply unhelpful and both racist and prejudiced way. It’s only a small signal but I think it’s something that we should build on.
The way in which, although there was fear developed from the 11 September, particularly by the Islamic Community, the coming together of leaders, opinion callers, in communities across the country, has actually helped in bridging the gap between racial groups, between Hindu and Islam – as I’ve seen again in the last few weeks in meetings with them over the issue of Kashmir – that can actually build greater trust and understanding and bring people together. It’s been true in the areas that experienced the disturbances last summer, particularly in Bradford, Oldham and Burnley, but elsewhere as well.
And what we now need to do is to be able to build on the goodwill that has developed rather than let it go, rather than believe that once an incident is over, eventually things will just right themselves. Well they don’t need to right themselves because there was so much wrong going on that we need to be able to claim back that territory on an ongoing basis. And I want to illustrate that by picking up some of what emerged from the disturbances.
It’s not fashionable and it’s certainly gone out of the political culture to talk about class, but I want to do that tonight, very briefly. Very many of the isolationist tendencies, many of the problems that have separated communities are reflected in the issue of socio-economic disadvantage – of class. If you live in a poor area in poor housing, and you find that the education provision is less than satisfactory, the chances are that you’re there because your income or opportunity is low, that the standard of living you’re experiencing doesn’t allow you to literally escape from those circumstances. And that’s true whether you are white, black or Asian.
And because socio-economic class disadvantage is reinforced by racism and prejudice, it is very likely, in fact it is statistically the truth, that very many people with a black or Asian cultural background, find themselves experiencing that disadvantage. 70% of ethnic minority citizens in this country, resident in this country, actually live in the 88 most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Britain as defined through the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme and the definitions that have been drawn up for investment by Government.
So, we need to tackle the inherent problems and we need to do so in a way that unites black and white, Asian and working class traditional communities, so that they know that they face a common problem and they need common solutions. And that is of course to have a decent job, to be paid well, to actually have their kids in schools that are functioning, as Estelle Morris was describing earlier this week, and to be able to see a physical improvement in their housing and their environment. That’s just a simple fact.
However, merely to stop there is to miss the crucial difference between 40 years ago and now because the overt racism that I was describing a moment ago is often now replaced by covert racism – the glass ceiling, the way in which people find themselves disadvantaged in wholly new ways. People whose children have actually experienced the opportunity and have taken it, of a decent education, and have found that disadvantage still faces them head on, that they’re being faced with prejudice in being able to use the talent and the experience they have. That they’ve found themselves in positions of moderate success only to be blocked in terms of being able to use that education, that experience, that professionalism in exactly the same way as their white counterparts.
Now it does vary, I mean it varies between ethnic groups as people know in education. There are enormous differences in terms of levels of success and there are in terms of job opportunity and earnings. But the surveys that have been undertaken, and they are slightly out of date, we’re talking about 2-3 or more years ago – and we need as part of the programme of bringing our Race Equality Unit and our work up to date, to actually do much more focused work on this – but the statistics are pretty stark in terms of what you can expect from one community as opposed to another.
So, I want to just say tonight that I think the Government have got a role in terms, firstly of acknowledging the problem themselves. That is, with public service action. But secondly, to develop this in the private and business sector so that this is setting example in the public service but then not pretending that it is the public service alone that has the essential commitment to do the job.
So we need to work with the CBI and the TUC much more effectively. And the re-vamped and re-directed CRE needs to take on a new focus in terms of being able to make those essential changes. Because the way in which we develop not only what we know to be wrong, but the way in which we don’t know what we essentially know to be necessary to put it right, will make the difference between scepticism or enthusiasm from all sections of the community to actually be part of the solution.
I shall just reinforce again that we don’t want people to pass it across to someone else, always somebody should do something about it, but actually do something about it themselves.
To just illustrate that, I just want to give some statistics. If you take out the educational profile, the age and the geography, and you take the statistics – this applies to men only, I’m afraid, because that’s the way they were drawn up – we see that those from the broad black community have one third of the chance compared with their white equivalents of a professional job. For those from an Indian background it’s three fifths of the chance, from Pakistani and Bangladeshi it’s half the chance. In terms of earnings, those from an Afro-Caribbean background are likely to get £81 a week less than the equivalent white male with the same education opportunity, from an African background £132 less, from an Indian background it drops to £23, it rises again for Pakistani men to £129. The source of the Labour force surveys and the work that the Performance and Innovation Unit are just undertaking, which we will publish shortly, which will deal more broadly with some of these economic and educational issues and the factors that actually go in to demonstrating the difficulties, the gap, that exists.
But there’s no point in having good statistics. There’s no point in updating them, unless we are able to take pretty drastic steps to do something about it. And I think that is an illustration of the new nature of the challenge, of the way in which we need to deal with this.
I also want to just illustrate the importance of how we deal with social cohesion and matching the class issue, the socio-economic change with the new covert hidden glass ceilings and attitudinal, and institutional changes, with that social cohesion agenda. Partly because if you can bring communities together, at least in terms of their perceptions and perspective on change, and you can challenge some of the underlying difficulties that make bringing them together more difficult, then social cohesion isn’t an alternative to providing race equality but it underpins it and helps with it. Let me give just one or two examples.
If people believe that both the community that is seen as pulling together those from an Asian background with those from a traditional white background, are addressing common cause in terms of things that damage their life chances, then of course self evidently it will help them come together. But so, in my view, will addressing some of the difficult issues – because it prevents racists from being able to use those issues to make mischief. And it also demonstrates that we are one nation. We belong together. We’re not, as some people tried to say last December when I was raising these issues, to leave it to individual communities of interest to sort, what they called, “our” problem. It isn’t “our” problem, it’s “all our” problem.
The black women who are working through an agency called the Agency for Culture and Change Management are facing down the most enormous opposition within their community to stopping female genital mutilation. We in the Home Office are giving them a grant. I went to visit them. I was horrified at things they told me, that they illustrated to me, that I knew nothing about. Not just from one community, the Somali community, but right across many countries in Africa. The disappearance of youngsters in their teens back to those communities for what is an obscenity. And we should thank those women in facing within their own community, hostility to that change, because they’d recognised that this wasn’t some issue of culture, let alone of religion – which is what some of the older members were telling their teenage daughters – but was an unacceptable hangover from a bygone era.
And unless all of us are engaged with that, and we’re big enough to say so, then we separate out our communities and of course before anybody says it, of course, that is a two way street the other way. That people who find the way we keep our elders, that the way we deal with our youngsters, that the discipline that we would expect in our family and on our street need to be debated as well. This is not just a modernity issue, that was raised so vividly in the build up to the Netherlands election, but this is a two way process of challenging what is unacceptable but welcoming cultural diversity and difference. And unless we do the two, we miss the point of that balance.
In December, when I raised the issue of learning of the English language, citizenship, a welcome in terms of a ceremony for those who choose to become British nationals, one or two people called me a linguistic colonial and all sorts of garbage. When the Bill was debated in the House of Commons over the last six weeks, no one raised it, there’s been no opposition to it internally and all the opinion polling shows that the black and Asian community welcome it – in fact the figure is 76% actually on the Mori Poll welcome it – and believe it is a contribution both to developing social integration and cohesion and to a greater commitment and sense of belonging.
So let me just say for a moment how I intend, therefore, to develop the other strand of the work that I have responsibility for, which is about asylum and economic migration. It is very easy to misunderstand what I am doing on this, as it was on the speech in December and on the challenge of a two way street on integration and belonging.
What I’m trying to do is to develop a trusted, confident, workable asylum system with the help of the United Nations to actually be able to develop new gateways for people who are threatened with death and torture to be able to seek asylum in this country externally rather than coming in clandestinely under trains or in freight carriers. It’s taking time because the UNHCR are used to haranguing countries rather than actually working with them to find new solutions but they are doing with other nations and they can with us. They can, for instance, stop the 6,000 youngsters here at the moment, under the age of 18, who have been clandestinely trafficked across the world, singly, supposedly, with someone having paid the traffickers to get them here so that we can deal with the flow and the criminality as well as with the outcome. And of course we need to be able to deal with that by providing a different outlook from the Embassies and High Commissions across the world as well as working with the UNHCR itself.
We need, when people are here, to be able to deal with their claim effectively and quickly, and to be able to integrate those who justify their claim in a way that we’ve not done effectively before. But we also need to be aware that that isn’t the way in which those who seek economic migration should come. If 90% fail their claim with another 20% receiving exceptional leave to remain which allows them at the moment to work because we can’t send them back, then we have a situation where even the most enthusiastic opponent of myself, would actually acknowledge that most people would seek economic migration.
So why not facilitate that economic migration? Why not open up in greater degree the opportunity of people to come here, to work here, to develop their family here openly and legally. I’ve doubled the number of work permits this year to 150,000. We’ve opened up new migration routes in terms of skilled workers and in terms of those who are coming for short stay or for the seasonal work. We need, in Government, to get agreement on service sector, low skill, no skill work, to be able to do the same. So that we can open up those opportunities rather than literally hundreds of thousands of people working illegally in London and the South East, not paid the minimum wage with no rights and conditions, with their children no right of future abode, with exploitation at every turn, often with underpinning sexual exploitation by traffickers bringing in girls and women for that purpose.
In other words, there is a massive social as well as an economic agenda. But to sell it to the British people and to avoid the fear of change and flux which always creates tension and the danger of racists exploiting it, we need to do that effectively and legally. We need to have integration programmes that work. We need to deal with the consequent pressures on housing, particularly in the high employment, low unemployment areas. And we need to be able to support other services more effectively. That, I say, is the way in which properly managed migration should, and will, work in the future. And if we do that, then we can set aside some of the arguments which get off to the wrong foot immediately by misunderstanding those who are here to seek settlement as opposed to those who are granted settlement and welcome.
Two and a half billion pounds is the annual uplift in the economy of this country from migration. Over the years we have benefited enormously from those coming from around the world to work and settle in this country. We will need it even more in the future as the demographics change the balance of ageing. In fact, over 50%, within ten years, of those coming into the labour market as those of working age will be from those of either current or past ethnic minority communities. So there is an economic as well as a social imperative. And I believe there is a cultural one too in terms of the diversity, the literal colour of our community, the way in which we can live and work in wholly new ways.
That is a Britain of the future in a modern setting. That is a 21st century programme in which vigorous and determined anti-racism is matched by common sense, by dealing openly with issues that would otherwise fester and create the problem. And by providing a warm and lasting welcome to people who then become part of the country, have a sense of belonging, take on citizenship and work as we all should to ensure that that citizenship leads to mutuality and inter dependence. If we can get it right as the change we have been able to achieve since those days of the 1960s and all of us will be proud to be British.
Thank you very much.

Ronald Reagan,United States of America,1976-08-19 00:00:00,"Mr. President, Mrs. Ford, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President-to-be, the distinguished guests here, you ladies and gentlemen. I was going to say fellow Republicans here but those who are watching from a distance, all those millions of Democrats and independents who I know are looking for a cause around which to rally and which I believe we can give them. Mr. President, before you arrive tonight, these wonderful people, here, when we came in, gave Nancy and myself a welcome. That, plus this, plus your kindness and generosity in honoring us by bringing us down here will give us a memory that will live in our hearts forever.
Watching on television these last few nights I've seen also the warmth with which you greeted Nancy and you also filled my heart with joy when you did that. May I say some words. There are cynics who say that a party platform is something that no one bothers to read and is doesn't very often amount to much. Whether it is different this time than is has ever been before, I believe the Republican party has a platform that is a banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades. We have just heard a call to arms, based on that platform.
And a call to us to really be successful in communicating and reveal to the American people the difference between this platform and the platform of the opposing party which is nothing but a revamp and a reissue and a rerunning of a late, late show of the thing that we have been hearing from them for the last 40 years.
If I could just take a moment, I had an assignment the other day. Someone asked me to write a letter for a time capsule that is going to opened in Los Angeles a hundred years from now, on our Tricentennial.
It sounded like an easy assignment. They suggested I write about the problems and issues of the day. And I set out to do so, riding down the coast in an automobile, looking at the blue Pacific out on one side and the Santa Ynez Mountains on the other, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was going to be that beautiful a hundred years from now as it was on that summer day.
And then as I tried to write-let your own minds turn to that task. You're going to write for people a hundred years from now who know all about us, we know nothing about them. We don't know what kind of world they'll be living in. And suddenly I thought to myself, ""If I write of the problems, they'll be the domestic problems of which the President spoke here tonight; the challenges confronting us, the erosion of freedom taken place under Democratic rule in this country, the invasion of private rights, the controls and restrictions on the vitality of the great free economy that we enjoy."" These are the challenges that we must meet and then again there is that challenge of which he spoke that we live in a world in which the great powers have aimed and poised at each other horrible missiles of destruction, nuclear weapons that can in a matter of minutes arrive at each other's country and destroy virtually the civilized world we live in.
And suddenly it dawned on me; those who would read this letter a hundred years from now will know whether those missiles were fired. They will know whether we met our challenge.
Whether they will have the freedom that we have known up until now will depend on what we do here. Will they look back with appreciation and say, ""Thank God for those people in 1976 who headed off that loss of freedom? Who kept us now a hundred years later free? Who kept our world from nuclear destruction?""
And if we fail they probably won't get to read the letter at all because it spoke of individual freedom and they won't be allowed to talk of that or read of it.
This is our challenge and this is why we're here in this hall tonight. Better than we've ever done before, we've got to quit talking to each other and about each other and go out and communicate to the world that we may be fewer in numbers than we've ever been but we carry the message they're waiting for. We must go forth from here united, determined and what a great general said a few years ago is true: ""There is no substitute for victory."" Mr. President.

Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2015-10-22,"Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings, members of the committee. The terrorist attacks at our diplomatic compound and later, at the CIA post in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 took the lives of four brave Americans: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.
I am here to honor the service of those four men, the courage of the Diplomatic Security agency and the CIA officers who risked their lives that night, and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world.
I knew and admired Chris Stevens. He was one of our nation's most accomplished diplomats. Chris's mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, because he was always moving, always working, especially in the Middle East that he came to know so well.
When the revolution broke out in Libya, we named Chris as our envoy to the opposition. There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century American envoy. But his work was very much 21st century hard-nosed diplomacy.
It is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi. They held signs reading ""thugs don't represent Benghazi or Islam."" ""Sorry people of America, this is not the behavior of our Islam or our Prophet."" ""Chris Stevens, a friend to all Libyans.""
Although I didn't have the privilege of meeting Sean Smith personally, he was a valued member of our State Department family. An Air Force veteran, he was an Information Management officer, who had served in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague.
Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty worked for the CIA. They were killed by mortar fire at the CIA's outpost in Benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. They were both former Navy SEALs and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
As Secretary of State, I had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.
Losing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally.
I was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our Ambassador to to the President.
After the attacks, I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket and those of the other three Americans off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base.
I took responsibility. And, as part of that, before I left office, I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.
What happened in Benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting Accountability Review Board, seven prior Congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
So today I would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.
First, America must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.
The State Department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.
Chris Stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed. In fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.
He also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.
Since 2001, there have been more than one hundred attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.
But if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they'll tell you they can't do their jobs for us from bunkers.
It would compound the tragedy of Benghazi if Chris Stevens' death and the death of the other three Americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.
We have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.
That's why Chris was in Benghazi. It's why he had served previously in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem during the second intifada.
Nobody knew the dangers of Libya better – a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time.
He knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country's fragile transition to democracy. And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia.
He also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. The nearest Israeli airport is just a day's drive from the Libyan border.
Above all, Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremists' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. That's what those thousands of Libyans were saying after they learned of his death. He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.
Retreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead. That doesn't mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort. Quite the opposite.
We need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America's strengths and values. Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.
And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country—our country—because they believed – as I do – that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.
After previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. That's what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack, attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.
It's what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve Americans. It's what happened during the Bush administration after 9/11.
Part of America's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.
After the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been eighteen previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.
And the Review Board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements. I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation. And they were. More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies. Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.
And Secretary Kerry has continued this work. But there is more to do. And no administration can do it alone. Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.
For example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field. But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.
Finally, there is one more observation I'd like to share:
I traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.
Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree — far from it — but we do come together when it counts.
As Secretary of State, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. I worked with Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.
I know it's possible to find common ground, because I have done it.
We should debate on the basis of fact, not fear. We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.
So I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.
And my challenge to you, members of this Committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.
Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons. To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.
That's what I tried to do every day as Secretary of State. And it's what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.
",Opening Statement to House Select Committee on Benghazi,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/opening-statement-house-select-committee-benghazi
Walter Clegg,United Kingdom,2018-04-06,"The last Parliament had one distinct advantage over the present Parliament, in that the hon. Member for North Fylde, being then a Government Whip, was unable to speak except to move the Adjournment of the House. Alas, those halcyon days are past.
Other hon. Members left the Chamber swiftly as soon as I rose to make what is virtually a maiden speech after four years of silence. But I propose to bear in mind what I call Clegg’s Laws of Listening, which I formulated after sitting for many a weary hour on the Government Front Bench and keeping silent, as you have to do in your Chair, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The first of those laws is that the second half of any speech appears to be twice as long as the first, and the second law is that the enjoyment of a speech is in inverse proportion to its length. I shall try my best to bear those two laws in mind when I speak.
The problems I have chosen to raise in the debate affect the port and town of Fleetwood in my constituency. They are very much the problems of success and not of failure. Not many years ago many people said that the port of Fleetwood was finished and that Fleetwood as a town was on the way down. That is quite contrary to what has happened over the past few years. From about 1970 onwards the port and the town have flourished.
The change started with the reinstatement of the Isle of Man steamer service for summer travellers to the Isle of Man from the port. Then we had the expansion of industry on the town’s estate, after the adoption of Fylde as an assisted area, and next we had remarkable development in the port itself.
First, we had the new Jubilee Quay for the inshore fishermen, and in the space of one year alone the inshore fleet doubled. We have also embarked on the modernisation of the fish dock. Work on that has just about started, and it will mean a much better dock for the use of the fishing fleet in future.
In addition, we have had a development of the dry cargo side of Fleetwood, which has been remarkable. I pay tribute to the British Transport Docks Board, and particularly to our local manager, who has played such a great part in the operation. From being a port that handled comparatively little dry cargo, we are now handling more and more through lift-off facilities. Roll-on, roll-off facilities are being made available. A Private Bill has come to Parliament from the board to provide even more facilities in the port. This is very good for the town and the port of Fleetwood. We have very good labour relations.
I am pleased that the board has made an effort to develop our port, but it produces problems, as success often does. One problem is the flow of traffic to the port, which has to come through some winding country lanes from the present M6. When the Blackpool spur of the M6 is built, it will still have to come through country lanes. The part I am concerned with is a stretch between the end of Amounderness Way and the boundaries of Fleetwood.
I have been given figures by the board of the flow of traffic along the stretch of road which goes through Thornton Cleveleys in my constituency, quite a heavily populated area. In 1973 the estimated number of road vehicle journeys—vehicles using the port, and not light traffic—was 61,630. This year that figure will increase to about 73,000. but I am told that in 1975—and this is a revised figure I received over the weekend—the estimated number of road vehicle journeys is about 200,000.
All this is in addition to the normal traffic to the port, which includes holiday traffic going to Fleetwood itself and to Thornton Cleveleys—both holiday resorts —private motorists going to the Isle of Man steamer and other heavy vehicles which use the same route for the factories that ICI has in the area and for the power station. It is true that we have a railway system for freight which still goes to part of Fleetwood but it does not go into the port itself. It stops short at the power station and the ICI sidings. One can see little hope of relief in that respect.
The impact upon Thornton Cleveleys already is quite intense. I want to quote what the local newspaper had to say about the stretch of the Fleetwood Road which is now used by these heavy vehicles. I travel along it frequently and it looks something like the Menin Road in the First World War—as though it had been shelled—because, in addition to all the problems of traffic, we have had the construction of a major sewerage scheme and a drainage scheme, and the road is upset.
The Thornton Cleveleys Times of 22nd March had the headline: ‘It’s Murder’, says traffic sufferers and it went on: Walls and chimneys cracking, tins of food jumping off shop shelves, beds shaking and pictures moving on the walls were just a few complaints from up-in-arms residents this week complaining about heavy traffic using the Fleetwood Road, Thornton. One of my constituents said that it was almost like living in a house with a poltergeist, because everything was always on the move.
There is also the problem of safety—of heavy vehicles using a narrow road lined for the most part on both sides with houses.
The Minister is probably well aware of this problem because it has been put to the Ministry before. What is needed most of all to effect relief is the completion of the Thornton Cleveleys bypass, which would take traffic from the end of Amounderness Way and take it through Copse Road, Fleetwood. This would have an immediate effect if it were constructed as quickly as possible. I have been in touch with the Lancashire County Council—the road authority—and with the new Wyre District Council, which was inaugurated today, and to which I wish the best of good will. Both councils give very high priority to this project.
I ask the Minister two specific questions: first, has there been any delay in letting the Lancashire County Council know the full material it needs for its transport policies and programmes, and, secondly, when will it be possible for the Department to let the county council know how much money it will have available?—because I understand that in this case these priorities are set more by the Lancashire County Council than by the Department itself.
The key factor for the county council is: when will it know how much money is available so that it can allocate priority to this road? The needs for this road are incontestable. They are two-fold. First, there is the need to look after the safety of the people using the road at the moment and to look after the lives of the people living along the road, in the environmental sense, and, secondly, the need for new communications, especially with the new spur of the M6, which is essential if the port of Fleetwood is to develop, remain properous, and become more prosperous. I press the urgency of these items on the Minister and his Department. I urge them to do all they can to give us this relief road as soon as possible.
I now turn to some other problems of the port which are not the direct responsibility of the hon. Member—I have informed him of these—but which he could well pass on particularly to his right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
The Fleetwood fishing fleet is under some difficulty in that it must be kept fully modernised. It is easy for ports that do not have modernised fishing fleets to fall by the wayside. For example, Milford Haven is now virtually finished as a fishing port. That leaves Fleetwood as the major deep-sea port on the west of the country, including Wales and Scotland.
Fleetwood has a strong desire to keep its fishing fleet up to date. It has that desire for more than one reason. Deep-sea fishing is a highly dangerous, skilled and arduous job. If any job was referable as a special case involving hardship at work, the trawlermen’s job would surely come into that category. Fleetwood wants to send its men to sea in the best equipped ships that it is possible to have. I ask that consideration be given to reinstating the grant which was obtainable for the building of fishing vessels.
At the same time I ask that consideration be given to the impact of oil fuel costs on the fishing industry. If it were possible to get back such costs from the market there would be little or no problem, but I doubt whether that is possible. I am not asking specifically for the refunding of such costs, but I ask that the matter be kept under surveillance. At one time there was an operational subsidy, but that is no longer in force. Fuel costs are having an impact on the fishing industry, and I ask that the matter be kept under review. Unless there is a proper return from the market or some sort of subsidy it is possible that fishing will become unprofitable. That would be a dangerous situation.
Finally, I draw attention to the problem of fishing limits. Fleetwood vessels are still fishing around Iceland, but that fishing will come to an end. The Law of the Sea Conference at Caracas will take place this year, and many countries are saying that they are determined to obtain wider fishing limits. If that is so, the fishermen of Fleetwood will want their share of any new limits that the conference hands out. We must have fishing grounds to enable the fleet to live.
The fishermen have suggested a limit of 200 miles. If other countries get wider limits, that is what Fleetwood will want. We shall have to bear in mind the points of view which are expressed at the conference, but if other countries leave the conference with wider limits there will be a tremendous reaction in this country right around the coast if similar limits are not granted to our fishermen.
I have referred to some of the problems in the port and town of Fleetwood. Happily, they are problems which arise from success and not from failure.
",1974 Speech on Fleetwood,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/walter-clegg-1974-speech-on-fleetwood/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-08-31,"Thank you very much. That's a lot of friends. A lot of friends. So, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you very much for the terrific job you're doing and also to the spectacular small-business owners that are here today. Many of those small-business owners -- Linda McMahon, who is a small-business owner and it became a big business. A great business. And we have so many of them here today. I know some of them. And congratulations.
I want to wish everyone a very, very happy Labor Day and Labor Day weekend. Have a good time. I assume right after this you're just going to scoot, right. It's a great place. You don't have to go anywhere.
But I'm thrilled to be back in Charlotte, and the fact is that it's a very special place. So special that we chose it for the 2020 Republican National Convention, right? And we got a lot of places that want it. You know, a lot of places want those things where so many people come in and spend their money. But Charlotte has been a great place for us. And I actually have investments in Charlotte. They'll say, ""Oh, there's a conflict of interest..
You know where my club is, right? Trump National. And it's a very big success on Lake Norman. Beautiful. Largest man-made lake in the world, by far. Right? The electric company. Had to be more than man-made. That was made with a lot of money for a long time.
In just a few minutes, I'll sign an executive order to extend the incredible benefits of retirement savings accounts -- such a big thing -- to American workers employed at small businesses all across our nation.
As we head into Labor Day, our nation pays its gratitude to the hardworking men and women who make our country run. And I'm going to be doing a little work over the weekend. I'm going to be studying, you know, the federal workers in Washington that you've been reading so much about. People don't want to give them any increase. They haven't had one in a long time.
I said, I'm going to study that over the weekend. It's a good time to study it -- Labor Day. Let's see how they do next week. But a lot of people were against it. I'm going to take a good hard look over the weekend.
Today's historic action will provide new retirement security to countless American workers and their families. We believe all Americans should be able to retire with the confidence, dignity, and economic security that you want. We're going to make sure you do that, provided you get out there and you work a little bit, right? We want to do that.
I especially want to thank Secretary of Labor -- who's done an incredible job by the way -- Alex Acosta. Alex, thank you. Great job. Great job. And Small Business -- I always say it's small business, but it's actually a massive, massive job that she does. It's incredible, the size of it. But it's called Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, for helping to lead this important effort. And Linda has been a real star. And even Alex and all of us will admit that. She's been a real star. Thank you, Linda. Incredible job.
We're also grateful to be joined by several fantastic members of Congress. They helped me, and them, and you, and everybody with the largest tax cuts this country has ever seen and with the cutting of regulation. You know, as small-business owners, I can tell you the cutting of regulation -- I have friends that say maybe the regulation cutting -- we've cut more regulation in the less than two years than any administration, no matter how long it was, has cut during their entire administration. And we're not finished. We're not finished. But I've had many business people say that's more important even than the tax cuts. I don't want to knock our tax cuts, because people love our tax cuts. But the cutting of regulations, in many ways, might be just as important or more important.
So I want to thank, and I want to congratulate -- they're incredible people. They're working hard. And we're working against a tide of blue. And the tide of blue -- you know, they want to have open borders. They don't mind crime. They don't take care of our military. They don't take care of our vets. We're taking great care of our vets. What we're doing for our vets -- Choice, Accountability. How about, after 48 years, we got Choice approved. So veterans now can go, and if they have a long wait, they say bye-bye, I'm going to see the doctor next door, and we pay for the bill.
And actually, we're going to save a lot of money, but they're going to be taken care of. Because, you know, we have vets that used to wait in line for 7 days, 20 days, 30 days. I've heard up to 38 days. They go in, they're not feeling good, and they -- but it's simple to get them okay. But then they can't see the doctor for so long they end up being terminal. Not going to happen anymore. So we got that and we got Accountability. So now, if they treat our vets badly, we'll look at them and very gently say, ""You're fired."" Bing, get out. Right?
And these guys -- these folks did it. So I want to thank Ted Budd. Ted. Incredible. And I have to tell you, he loves you people. I want to tell you that. We know that. That is true, isn't it, Ted? Huh? We have to give a little special acknowledgement to you, Ted. You've got a lot of friends. You better believe it.
Virginia Foxx. She's been my friend from the beginning. Thank you, Virginia. Right from the beginning. Richard Hudson. Richard. Great job. You're doing a great job. I can't tell you how much they help me get this stuff done. You know, we have Make America Great Again.
Keep America Great! -- exclamation point. When they say it without the exclamation point, they say, ""What is wrong with you?"" Because it is; we are exclaiming. But it's ""Keep America Great!""
And we're really at a point. You know, we picked up $10 trillion in worth since the election. We have more people working today -- right, Patrick? We have more people working today than at any time in the history of our country.
Think of that. To me, that's a stat that's just -- in other words, more people are working right now than at any time in the history of our country. That's a good number. That's a hard one to beat. I don't know, Meadows, do you think that that's a line that the Democrats are going to have a hard time with? Don't you think?
Well, let see. We have the highest stock market in history. They're investment geniuses.
I tell the story -- you probably heard it -- but a policeman in New York City. I'm with a group and we're having -- I gave a little speech, you know, we're walking outside -- and I love the law enforcement, and so I always take pictures with them when I'm finished. And one policeman comes up, good-looking guy. He says, ""You know, my wife always thought I was a financial loser. She thinks I'm a business genius. Right?
And I'll tell you what -- I think it's going to be really hard for open-border, crime-infested Democrats to win that guy's vote. Maybe I'm wrong. But we're not wrong too often, are we?
So I have another friend of mine who's been incredible. He has the single greatest name in all of politics. His name is Patrick McHenry. And congressman -- powerful. He's a powerful congressman. And I said, ""If I was born with your name, Patrick, I would have been President 20 years ago. But he's been great.
And Mark Meadows and Joe Wilson. Mark and Joe. We don't have to worry about Mark and Joe. They're up very high in this world. I guess, Mark, you're only up about -- I won't even say it; it's almost embarrassing. I saw poll numbers for Mark Meadows. I wouldn't give him too much money, okay.
Mark Meadows is not going to lose his race. That's the only thing I can guarantee. In life, I won't guarantee anything. I'll guarantee that Mark is going to do just fine. All right? Thank you. Thank you.
And, Deb -- where is Deb? Where's your wife? Is she here?
Where is she? Stand up. She's the real boss in the family. She's incredible. Thank you, Deb. Thank you. They drove three and a half hours to be here.
Also, a special thank you to North Carolina's very talented -- everyone is talking about him -- they're all talking about him. And I have a feeling he has his mind made up. He's going to be going for a little different position, slightly higher, in two years: Dan Forest -- your lieutenant governor.
He's great. Great guy. Great guy. You see, Dan, with all of that paparazzi back -- this was just supposed to be a quick little signing, in and out -- they're going crazy when I introduce all you guys, because they end up saying, this is like a political event. But that's okay, Dan. We'll take it, right? And you don't have to pay for it either. That's all right too.
No, Dan has been fantastic, and people are talking about him all over North Carolina. And I know he has a great future. Big future.
I also want to welcome the President and CEO of the International Franchise Association, Robert Cresanti. Robert? Thank you very much, Robert. The CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, a very -- really, honestly, that's a thing that -- I love home building. Close to my heart. Jerry Howard. Jerry -- thank you, Jerry. And the President and CEO of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, Bob Morgan. Thank you, Bob. Good job. Good job on getting the convention, really. Good job on getting the convention.
As you all know, the complexity of current federal regulations makes it extremely difficult for small businesses to afford retirement savings accounts for their great employees. While large companies can afford to deal with these burdensome regulations -- and of course, they've been reduced very substantially for large companies also -- but smaller companies just can't do it; they can't handle it.
. And it's a terrible thing. And you see it, and so many people complain about it. But we're taking care of it. We've done a lot. This is one more thing. .
They gave me a list before of things to read out, of accomplishments of the Trump administration. It was five pages long, single lines. And I said, ""We don't have enough time to do that. They know what it is. They know what it is. They don't want to report it, and that's okay.
That's why I'm taking very bold action to lower the cost of retirement plans so that they can become an affordable option for businesses of all sizes. That's a big thing. It wasn't available. Now it is.
Small businesses will no longer be at a competitive disadvantage, and small-business workers will now be treated more fairly and have many more choices. They didn't have a choice. They didn't have it. But even if they did, they didn't have a choice.
We will accomplish this goal by reducing regulatory barriers, allowing small businesses to band together to create low-cost association retirement plans -- such a big thing. They'll be banding together. They'll have such strength. They'll be able to negotiate incredible deals because they'll have big numbers. And I will tell you, I already know, a lot of companies are getting together; they're making incredible deals, Alex.
And it's because of what you've done and your group. That's just a fantastic thing. So I want to thank you.
In other words, small businesses will be able to pool their resources so that they can have the same purchasing power or even more, frankly, as large businesses. It's great. Save a lot of money and get better plans.
Retirement savings plans will now be available to more Americans than ever before. And I want to just say one thing. You know, we just made a great deal for both countries with Mexico. Big thing. Big, big thing.
NAFTA was a disaster, and we've changed it around. We're not going to have companies leaving anymore. We're not going have people losing their jobs because these great companies are leaving for other lands, and in certain cases, Mexico. Mexico has got some tremendous advantages also. It's good for both.
And I just have to say, because it is funny. I just said -- because, you know, I just -- you know the way I feel. I gave an interview yesterday to Bloomberg Business. And I said ""off the record,"" and I made a statement about Canada, which is fine, because I love Canada. But they've taken advantage of our country for many years. They have tremendous, tremendous trade barriers.
And they have tremendous tariffs. Dairy products are -- do you know this Mark? -- almost 300 percent tariff. Nobody talks about that; nobody says that. They say, ""Oh, Canada. We love Canada."" I do too. I even love their national anthem. It's called, very appropriately, ""Oh, Canada.
But they have taken advantage of us, as has virtually every country in the world. In fact, when they haven't, I say, ""What's wrong with you?"" But I can't find any, so I haven't been able to say that yet. But I gave a totally off-the-record -- you saw it -- it said, ""off the record."" And I said something strong, but it's my belief. And they violated it. And they said they were violating it.
It's unbelievable what's happening with the fake news. It's unbelievable. When you say off the record, that's a very -- it's not a legal term, but it's a term of honor. So when I say ""off the record, here's the story,"" in order, really, to save time -- I don't want to waste a lot of time -- and then they say -- they actually printed my off-the-record. They said, ""President Trump said, off the record"" and then they go on this. This is a first."" These are very dishonorable people. But I said, in the end it's okay, because at least Canada knows how I feel. So, it's fine. It's fine. It's true. .
Just happened. I mean, it just happened as I came off the plane. I said, ""That's impossible to do. No, they didn't do that."" They would have been better off if they left the off-the-record. And usually what they do is they will leave the off-the-record and then say, ""Oh, I thought it was on the record.""
To explain more about how our plan will work, I'd like to invite -- really, he's become a friend of mine -- but much importantly, the Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta and Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon to come up and just say a few words about exactly what this represents, what it means.
Thank you. Linda. Alex.
Thank you, Linda. Thank you very much, both Alex and Linda. You do an incredible job.
I'd like to now welcome up Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. Jerry does a phenomenal job running that group. Respected all over the country. Jerry, please. Say a few words? Thank you.
Thank you very much, Jerry. And that is true. We have so many companies coming back to our country, which nobody thought was going to happen. And they want to be where the action is. And we're going to -- I can tell you, we're going to start looking at, very seriously, merit-based immigration. We have to do it, because we need people. We need people to run these great companies that are coming in.
And there are a lot of great people out there. We're not the bad guys. We want great people coming into our country, so we're going to look very strongly at merit-based to get people in that help the homebuilders and all of the companies that are coming back. Some of them left years ago. And everybody said they'll never be back. They're coming back and they're coming back fast. So we're going to be providing a lot of help to them because that's what we have to do.
We call it ""Make America Great Again."" The fact is, we really -- it's a very important element. Way ahead of schedule, as far as I'm concerned. I thought it was going to happen. But nobody had any idea it was going to happen this quickly. It's an amazing thing. A great thing what's happening to our country.
If you look at steel, steel was a dead business. They were closing up one plant after another. And now, as you know, they were dumping steel all over the place, destroying our companies. And what they would have done when the companies are all destroyed, they would have sent us steel and they would have charged whatever we would have paid. We would have paid a fortune. Much more than we'll end up paying.
And steel is a business that you have to have. Aluminum, also. Same thing. But you have to see what's happening with the steel industry. You don't get it. I mean, they don't tell you about it. Jobs are being produced. Plants are opening. U.S. Steel is opening up at least eight new plants. Nucor, other companies are opening up plants all over. It's a beautiful thing. It's an incredible thing what's going on with our country. It's incredible.
So I'd like to now ask the President of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, Bob Morgan, to come up and say a few words about what a great city this is and why we chose it for the Republican National Convention. That's an important one.
Thank you. Come on up, please.
. They're going through the roof. And there's a long way to go. There's a long way to go.
When we straighten out these terrible trade deals and when we make fair deals for our military, where we're not protecting every nation on Earth -- some of whom are very wealthy -- and they are not doing anything for us, when they start helping out and making it fair, you're going to see where we go. I mean, we have such potential in this country. Nobody has -- I have never seen anything like it. Nobody has seen anything like it. And so our economy has a long way to go.
Already, we've created, since election, more than 4 million jobs, including 156,000 jobs right here in North Carolina.
You all know about economic growth going up to now -- it was 4.1; now it's 4.2. That was revised two days ago. But unemployment filings have dropped to the lowest level -- think of that -- to the lowest level in over half a century.
You've heard me say this many times; I'm very proud of it. Remember I used to say, ""What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?"" Because I'd read these horrible statistics -- highest crime, worst education, all the bad things; lowest home ownership -- about African Americans. And they've always voted for Democrats. Not all, but a big proportion.
And I'd say, ""What do you have to lose?"" -- after reading these horrible stats. And my people would say, ""Oh, that's not a nice thing to say."" I'd say, ""But it's true."" ""What do you have to lose? Give us a shot.""
So this just came out -- and I've been saying it for the last two weeks -- African American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded in our history. It's a big thing. . Huh?
That's why Kanye West and Jim Brown -- how good was Jim Brown? He came out in favor of Trump. And you know what? Nobody is going to say anything about it. He was some -- some player.
But a lot of folks have come out in favor of what I am doing because they see what's happening and how great it's been for the African American community, for the Hispanic American community, where unemployment has reached the lowest level also ever recorded. Likewise, for the Asian community, lowest ever recorded. And I jokingly say -- I said it last night -- we had an incredible rally in Indiana. Did anybody see that? It was incredible. Big ratings. You know what? If it didn't get the ratings, you wouldn't be seeing it. Big ratings.
But I jokingly said last night, I said, ""Women, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,"" because we have Asian, African American, Hispanic -- almost all -- the best in history. Women unemployment, it's only 65 years. So I said it last night, and I said, ""I'm sorry. I'm trying hard."" But it's the best number they've had in 65 years. But that's as good as history.
But I think that within about three to four weeks, Deb -- three to four weeks, I think what you're going to have is you'll have the best in history also. Because 65 years, we'll take that any day. But we're going to have something special.
Our Pledge to American Workers has resulted in employers committing to train more than 4 million Americans. And that numbers just has increased to 5 million Americans, where employees are now willing to train. This was something that wasn't happening.
As I said, we passed the biggest tax cuts. We got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare. And we've really decimated Obamacare.
And you know, one thing also, the Obamacare premiums were -- previous to us -- going up like rocket ships. They're not going up very much. We have really kept them down. And while we've taken -- I mean, we have really changed that whole situation around. We've done a great job.
And if you look at your premiums, nothing is perfect, but I'll tell you what, if the Democrats were running it -- you were going up 120 percent, 150 percent -- now you're just going up a very little bit. Some of them aren't going up at all.
We've done a great job, but we're going to be getting rid of it entirely. But we got rid of the most -- we got rid of the most obnoxious provision I think I've seen in just about any contract: You have the right to pay for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare. In other words, you pay so that you don't have to pay. But that payment is a little less than the second payment.
So you say, ""Oh, I won't have healthcare, I'll pay not to have"" -- you're paying for not having healthcare. We got rid of it. That was a big thing. And very important for the employers. Huh? Very important.
And this week we're working on Canada. We're working on a lot of different things. So last week it was Mexico. And this week it's Canada. And if we don't make a deal with Canada, that's just fine. But we'll see how it all works out.
I say affectionately, we'll just have to tariff those cars coming in. That's a lot of money coming in to the coffers of the United States.
I want to thank the people that are on this dais, all of whom I know, all of whom are special. They've bene great friends of mine. Really, in particular, Alex and Linda. The job you do is really incredible.
I promise to put American workers first. I promise to put their families first. In fact, I promise to put their families even ahead of them. And most of them like it. And the ones that don't, we don't like them too much anyway. Okay.
But today I'm honoring that promise once more, here in Charlotte. From our youngest citizens to our senior citizens, we're truly making America great again. And we're making it great for all Americans. It's been a tremendous -- a little bit less than two years -- it's been a tremendous period of time. Short period of time, but I think we've accomplished more than, I would say, just about any President. I don't think anybody is even close in their first two years.
So I just want to say, have a great Labor Day weekend. God bless you. And we will see all soon. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you fellas.
","Speech: Donald Trump Signs a Retirement Savings Executive Order in Charlotte, NC",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-retirement-savings-charlotte-nc-august-31-2018
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-06-28,"This is a great team, and they were actually here but they wanted to be here with Trump, right? The Ricketts family. But I just want to thank and I want to congratulate that team. Who's the best hitter? Tell me.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-04-02,"I have great respect for him. I have great respect for China. I would not be at all surprised if we did something that would be very dramatic and good for both countries and I hope so.
Yes, we will talk about North Korea. And China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone.
I think trade is the incentive. It is all about trade.
By telling China that we cannot continue to trade if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now. This is an unfair deal.
I don't want to talk about tariffs yet, perhaps the next time we meet. So I don't want to talk about tariffs yet. But you used the word equalise. That is a very good word because they are not equalised. If you used a word other than tariff, it is not an equal. You know when you talk about, when you talk about currency manipulation, when you talk about devaluations, they are world champions. And our country hasn't had a clue, they haven't had a clue. The past administration hasn't had and many administrations Ñ I don't want to say only Obama; this has gone on for many years Ñ they haven't had a clue. But I do.
Well, if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you.
Totally.
I don't have to say any more. Totally.
I'm not going to tell you. You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East. Where they say Ñ I used it in the speeches Ñ ""We will be attacking Mosul in four months"". A month later, ""We will be attacking Mosul in three months, in two months, in one month"". And why are they talking? There is no reason to talk.
I would say. I hope so.
Well it hasn't worked for our predecessors. Look where we are. We have an $800bn trade deficit. The Middle East is a mess. They shouldn't have gone in. And I was totally opposed to the war in the Middle East which I think finally has been proven, people tried very hard to say I wasn't but you've seen that it is now improving.
This isn't an exercise. This is a very, very serious problem that we have in the world today. And we have more than one but this is no exercise. This is not just... _talk. The United States has talked long enough and you see where it gets us, it gets us nowhere.
Alliances have not always worked out very well for us. But I do believe in alliances. I believe in relationships. And I believe in partnerships. But alliances have not always worked out very well for us. OK?
Well, I don't want to talk about when and I don't want to talk about timing. We will have a very massive and very strong tax reform. But I am not going to talk about when... Right now I am working very much on the... _You know that we didn't take a vote but with healthcare... _
I didn't want to take a vote. It was my idea. I said why should I take a vote.
Yeah, I don't lose. I don't like to lose. But that wasn't a definitive day. They are negotiating as we speak. I don't know if you know. They are negotiating right now. There was no reason to take a vote. I said, ""Don't take a vote,"" and we will see what happens. But one way or the other, I promised the people great healthcare. We are going to have great healthcare in this country. Now, it will be in one form or another. It will be a repeal and replace of Obamacare which is the deal that is being negotiated now. And if we don't get the... _Freedom Caucus there that would be fine. They're friends of mine. Many of them have already left, and many of them as you know have already given us their vote. But when you have zero Democrats, zero, you need close to 100 per cent of the Republicans.
Well I will get the Democrats if I go the second way. The second way, which I hate to see, then the Freedom Caucus loses so big and I hate to see that, because... _our plan is going to be a very good plan. When I say our plan, not phase one just: phase one, two and three added up is a great plan... _If we don't get what we want, we will make a deal with the Democrats and we will have in my opinion not as good a form of healthcare, but we are going to have a very good form of healthcare and it will be a bipartisan form of healthcare.
I am really liking it. I've enjoyed it. I've enjoyed it. We have done a lot... _We're doing great."" But a couple of them were going to build in Mexico, now they are building in Michigan. Now they are building in Ohio. We got it going.
Without the tweets, I wouldn't be here... Over 100m. I don't have to go to the fake media.
I don't regret anything, because there is nothing you can do about it. You know if you issue hundreds of tweets, and every once in a while you have a clinker, that's not so bad. Now my last tweet, you know the one that you are talking about perhaps, was the one about being in quotes wire tapped, meaning surveilled. Guess what, it is turning out to be true... _I predicted Brexit.
. I would have thought when it happened that more would follow, but I really think the European Union is getting their act together. It could be a very good thing for both.
It is a very interesting thing. If you would have asked me that the day after the election... _I would have said, ""Yeah, it will start to come apart"". But they have done a very good job and Ñ I am meeting with them very soon Ñ they have done a very good job in bringing it back together... _I had a great meeting with Chancellor Merkel. I had a great meeting with her, I really liked her. She said the same thing to me. I spoke to her two days ago. She said the same thing to me, we had a great meeting and the press doesn't get it.
I think that it's really holding. I think they've done a better job since Brexit. I think they have done a better job.
It just seems to be that there is a different spirit for holding together...
I don't know what is going to happen. I know that some outside distractions have taken place which have changed that race. That's going to be an interesting race. I really don't know and I don't know her. I have never met her. It's going to be a very interesting election. But you know some outside things have happened that maybe will change the course of that race.This is an abridged transcript that has been edited for clarity.

Sajid Javid,United Kingdom,2018-04-26,"Winston Churchill famously said: “We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.”
That’s certainly true for me.
As you may know, I grew up above the family shop.
I lived on a road that has been labelled by one newspaper as “Britain’s most dangerous street”.
Those experiences taught me a lot.
The value of family and hard work.
How few things are more important than feeling safe in your own home and your your own neighbourhood.
And – crucially – how to hold your own against 5 siblings.
Now I know that I’m not alone.
Our homes, for all of us, are the making of us.
That is why today’s event is so important.
And why I’m delighted that so many of you could be here today.
And why I want to say a massive thank you for your interest and support.
I can’t recall when a government last held a conference on design quality.
It’s a measure of our commitment on this vital issue – as not just something that is nice to have.
A bonus that if you are lucky enough to be able to afford it.
But as something that’s fundamental to everyone’s quality of life – regardless of whether you’re buying or you’re renting a place, or whether you’re in the private sector or the social sector.
It’s very fundamental to the way we feel when we get up in the morning and when we go to bed.
To the opportunities that we have and the futures that we can imagine for ourselves.
To people coming together to create, quite simply, great places to live.
Which is why there’s absolutely no question of having to choose between quality and quantity when it comes to building the homes that our country so desperately needs.
As you will have no doubt have heard many times today, the 2 – quality and quantity – go very much hand in hand.
With communities that are much more likely to welcome new development, if it’s attractive, thoughtful and in keeping with the local area.
But the gains are, of course, much bigger than just somewhere that looks good.
It could be a quiet place to study that means you get a better chance at school.
Parks and other outdoor spaces will be good for your health and your mental health.
And public spaces that design in opportunities for people to come together across generations can end up designing out isolation and helping to build those strong communities.
To achieve this, to really raise the bar on design quality, we need to see stronger collaboration right across the whole sector – which is what today’s event is all about.
It sounds like you’ve had a busy and interesting day, with lots of great speakers lots sharing their ideas and expertise.
And excellent examples, such as the University of North Cambridge development, that where they aren’t just aiming to meet short-term targets, but are very much taking that long-term view that we all want to see.
Something that’s crucial for creating homes that are a much-loved part of the fabric of our local areas not just now, but, potentially, well into the next century and beyond.
I’m also pleased to see that today’s conference has thrown up another positive variation of NIMBY – BIMBY or Beauty In My Backyard, from The Princes Foundation.
I’m looking forward to that phrase catching on!
The new technologies on display at the exhibition are also hugely impressive – as are the new technologies highlighted by the Farmer Review that address the need to build at pace and scale whilst still promoting quality and consumer choice.
And it was especially inspiring to see that we focused on the views, talents and aspirations of young people.
We’re remembering one of those young people this week – Stephen Lawrence.
An aspiring architect, whose murder 25 years ago, is still hard to bear.
The work of the Stephen Lawrence Trust – who we heard from today…
…which gives young people the opportunities which he was denied, to pursue a career in architecture…
….is a fitting tribute to his memory.
And I’m deeply grateful for all the efforts of everyone involved.
Their work is a poignant reminder that, in shaping homes, we’re also shaping lives.
And we owe it to this and the generations to come to leave a legacy of places that, whether you’re putting down roots or just passing through, lift the human spirit.
Inspired by a strong vision of what we want for our villages, our towns and cities, what we want them to look like and feel like in the future.
In doing so, we can draw on a rich history of British housing and urban design that is the envy of the world.
The elegant terraces and town houses, squares and crescents of the Georgian period.
Victorian terrace houses, avenues and parks.
Edwardian mansion blocks and flats.
The detached and semi-detached homes and garden suburbs of the 20th century.
What will our legacy be like for the 21st century?
What design approaches are we pioneering that will become the original features of the future?
What new built environments are we developing that meet the challenges of our age?
What trails are we blazing?
Are we truly drawing on the talents of all our people – with their diverse backgrounds and their perspectives – as we build that modern, global Britain?
This is what I want us to be thinking about and aiming for – with all of us doing our bit.
For our part, in government, we’ve strengthened the expectations for design quality and community engagement in the planning system.
This doesn’t, in any way, involve the government dictating what good design looks like, but it makes it clear that it must be rooted in and it must be backed by the local communities.
Of course, local authorities, they too have a leading role to play in setting a vision for their areas and their plans.
And it’s the job of developers and their designers to respond positively to these expectations; harnessing the talents of skilled professionals – urban designers, architects, engineers and landscape designers.
The great projects we’ve heard about today show that we’re already achieving this in many places and creating beautiful, safe, healthy neighbourhoods that command local support.
The challenge, now, is to deliver this consistently right across the country, so that high quality design is the norm rather than the exception.
I’m confident – from the ambition and wealth of talent I see before me – that that prize is very much in our grasp.
It only remains for me to thank you all, once again, for attending and contributing – particularly our speakers and sponsors at the event. Thank you all very much.

",Remarks: Donald Trump Answers Questions During White House Easter Egg Roll,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-easter-egg-roll-crowd-april-22-2019
John Tyler,United States of America,1842-12-30 00:00:00,"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I communicate herewith to Congress copies of a correspondence which has recently taken place between certain agents of the Government of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands and the Secretary of State.
The condition of those islands has excited a good deal of interest, which is increasing by every successive proof that their inhabitants are making progress in civilization and becoming more and more competent to maintain regular and orderly civil government. They lie in the Pacific Ocean, much nearer to this continent than the other, and have become an important place for the refitment and provisioning of American and European vessels.
Owing to their locality and to the course of the winds which prevail in this quarter of the world, the Sandwich Islands are the stopping place for almost all vessels passing from continent to continent across the Pacific Ocean. They are especially resorted to by the great number of vessels of the United States which are, engaged in the whale fishery in those seas. The number of vessels of all sorts and the amount of property owned by citizens of the United States which are found in those islands in the course of the year are stated probably with sufficient accuracy in the letter of the agents.
Just emerging from a state of barbarism, the Government of the islands is as yet feeble, but its dispositions appear to be just and pacific, and it seems anxious to improve the condition of its people by the introduction of knowledge, of religious and moral institutions, means of education, and the arts of civilized life.
It can not but be in conformity with the interest and wishes of the Government and the people of the United States that this community, thus existing in the midst of a vast expanse of ocean, should be respected and all its rights strictly and conscientiously regarded; and this must also be the true interest of all other commercial states. Far remote from the dominions of European powers, its growth and prosperity as an independent state may yet be in a high degree useful to all whose trade is extended to those regions; while its near approach to this continent and the intercourse which American vessels have with it, such vessels constituting five-sixths of all which annually visit it, could not but create dissatisfaction on the part of the United States at any attempt by another power, should such attempt be threatened or feared, to take possession of the islands, colonize them, and subvert the native Government. Considering, therefore, that the United States possesses so large a share of the intercourse with those islands, it is deemed not unfit to make the declaration that their Government seeks, nevertheless, no peculiar advantages, no exclusive control over the Hawaiian Government, but is content with its independent existence and anxiously wishes for its security and prosperity. Its forbearance in this respect under the circumstances of the very large intercourse of their citizens with the islands would justify this Government, should events hereafter arise to require it, in making a decided remonstrance against the adoption of an opposite policy by any other power. Under the circumstances I recommend to Congress to provide for a moderate allowance to be made out of the Treasury to the consul residing there, that in a Government so new and a country so remote American citizens may have respectable authority to which to apply for redress in case of injury to their persons and property, and to whom the Government of the country may also make known any acts committed by American citizens of which it may think it has a right to complain.
Events of considerable importance have recently transpired in China. The military operations carried on against that Empire by the English Government have been terminated by a treaty, according to the terms of which four important ports hitherto shut against foreign commerce are to be open to British merchants, viz, Amoy, Foo-Choo-Foo, Ningpo, and Chinghai. It can not but be interesting to the mercantile interest of the United States, whose intercourse with China at the single port of Canton has already become so considerable, to ascertain whether these other ports now open to British commerce are to remain shut, nevertheless, against the commerce of the United States. The treaty between the Chinese Government and the British commissioner provides neither for the admission nor the exclusion of the ships of other nations. It would seem, therefore, that it remains with every other nation having commercial intercourse with China to seek to make proper arrangements for itself with the Government of that Empire in this respect.
The importations into the United States from China are known to be large, having amounted in some years, as will be seen by the annexed tables, to $9,000,000. The exports, too, from the United States to China constitute an interesting and growing part of the commerce of the country. It appears that in the year 1841, in the direct trade between the two countries, the value of the exports from the United States amounted to $715,000 in domestic produce and $485,000 in foreign merchandise. But the whole amount of American produce which finally reaches China and is there consumed is not comprised in these tables, which show only the direct trade. Many vessels with American products on board sail with a primary destination to other countries, but ultimately dispose of more or less of their cargoes in the port of Canton.
The peculiarities of the Chinese Government and the Chinese character are well known. An Empire supposed to contain 300,000,000 subjects, fertile in various rich products of the earth, not without the knowledge of letters and of many arts, and with large and expensive accommodations for internal intercourse and traffic, has for ages sought to exclude the visits of strangers and foreigners from its dominions, and has assumed for itself a superiority over all other nations. Events appear likely to break down and soften this spirit of nonintercourse and to bring China ere long into the relations which usually subsist between civilized states. She has agreed in the treaty with England that correspondence between the agents of the two Governments shall be on equal terms--a concession which it is hardly probable will hereafter be withheld from other nations.
It is true that the cheapness of labor among the Chinese, their ingenuity in its application, and the fixed character of their habits and pursuits may discourage the hope of the opening of any great and sudden demand for the fabrics of other countries. But experience proves that the productions of western nations find a market to some extent among the Chinese; that that market, so far as respects the productions of the United States, although it has considerably varied in successive seasons, has on the whole more than doubled within the last ten years; and it can hardly be doubted that the opening of several new and important ports connected with parts of the Empire heretofore seldom visited by Europeans or Americans would exercise a favorable influence upon the demand for such productions.
It is not understood that the immediate establishment of correspondent embassies and missions or the permanent residence of diplomatic functionaries with full powers of each country at the Court of the other is contemplated between England and China, although, as has been already observed, it has been stipulated that intercourse between the two countries shall hereafter be on equal terms. An ambassador or envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary can only be accredited, according to the usages of western nations, to the head or sovereign of the state, and it may be doubtful whether the Court of Pekin is yet prepared to conform to these usages so far as to receive a minister plenipotentiary to reside near it.
Being of opinion, however, that the commercial interests of the United States connected with China require at the present moment a degree of attention and vigilance such as there is no agent of this Government on the spot to bestow, I recommend to Congress to make appropriation for the compensation of a commissioner to reside in China to exercise a watchful care over the concerns of American citizens and for the protection of their persons and property, empowered to hold intercourse with the local authorities, and ready, under instructions from his Government, should such instructions become necessary and proper hereafter, to address himself to the high functionaries of the Empire, or through them to the Emperor himself.
It will not escape the observation of Congress that in order to secure the important object of any such measure a citizen of much intelligence and weight of character should be employed on such agency, and that to secure the services of such an individual a compensation should be made corresponding with the magnitude and importance of the mission.

Andrew Selous,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"I am proud to be serving in a party whose leader, David Cameron has said he wants the government he aspires to lead to be judged on how it tackles poverty in office.Those sentiments are nothing new for this party.
From Shaftesbury to Disraeli, from Stanley Baldwin to Rab Butler, we have always seen the relief of poverty and the improvement of the conditions of all the people as a core part of our purpose.
Labour have tried to make the eradication of child poverty their issue, but much of the most powerful thinking on combating poverty in our country today is coming from those on the centre right and within our own party. I want to pay tribute to the outstanding work of Iain Duncan Smith and the Centre for Social Justice in their Breakthrough Britain reports on ending the costs of social breakdown.  My colleague in the Lords, David Freud wrote the key Government report on reforming welfare before he joined this party to help put real reform of welfare into practice and the shadow Work and Pensions team published its welfare reform paper last year in order to make British poverty history.
I do not doubt Labour’s commitment in this area.  But Labour have failed to meet the targets they set themselves and are miles away from meeting the target to reduce child poverty by half by 2010.  Even before the recession took hold they were very unlikely to have done so.  400, 000 more children are living in poverty since 2004  which means there are still four million children in poverty in the UK.   Even Alan Milburn has said that “poverty has become more entrenched”1 under this Government.
Labour have concentrated almost entirely on tax credits to relieve poverty.  I do not believe that tweaking a benefit here or a tax credit there will ever get to the heart of the problems that trap so many of our nation’s families in poverty. Our approach must be focused on turning round the lives of people who live in poverty and in many cases who have lived in poverty for generations.
That will require dealing with the root causes of poverty in a far more rigorous way.  We know that educational failure, worklessness, benefit traps, addiction, serious personal debt and family breakdown are the pathways into poverty for all too many of our fellow citizens. All these causes need to be addressed to keep families out of poverty.
This government measures poverty by looking at households which have less than 60% of median income.  We have greater ambition than to raise a family’s income by a few percent. If you knocked on the door of a household whose income had gone from 58% to 61% of the median and asked “What does it feel like to be out of poverty? “, I suspect you would get  a pretty surprised reply.  So we are looking at a wider range of indicators to measure success in this area.
Our approach to tackling poverty will be based on sound Conservative principles.  We know that to eradicate poverty you have to create more wealth.  You can not defeat poverty through the welfare system and tax credit system on its own.  So the people who start and grow businesses will be in the frontline of Conservative plans to combat poverty and we will need to pay special attention to those areas of our country which are jobs deserts, where almost no one works.  Some local authorities like Kent are taking the lead in this area and we want to see that best practice spread across the whole country.
As Conservatives we also recognise that poor children don’t exist in a vacuum.  They are part of poor families and we will take a whole family approach to combating child poverty. And that means extended families, including grandparents.  We believe not just that every child matters, but that every family matters. It is no coincidence that the United Kingdom has both one of the highest rates of child poverty in Europe as well as one of the highest rates of family breakdown.  The courage and determination that David Cameron has shown to strengthen families has never been more necessary to reduce poverty in our country.
We also recognise that government and families can not, on their own, always find the solutions to getting out of poverty.  The helping hand of the voluntary sector is absolutely vital too.  It’s  role and that of so many social enterprises will be central to the next Conservative’s government’s approach to fighting poverty.  And one thing we will change straight away is the refusal of the Department for Work and Pensions to signpost the voluntary help available in their areas.  This summer I learnt  that the department had actually stopped a job centre from telling its customers about a local food bank.  And they did this even though health visitors, social services and probation officers all work in closely with the food bank.  You see Gordon Brown’s view is that if everybody can’t have something then no one should.  Well, we think that’s wrong and we will instruct every Jobcentre Plus district manager in the country to sit down with charities providing emergency food,  debt counselling services, homelessness charities, family support groups and so on, to work out how this support can be signposted locally so that people in desperate poverty can find it.
Ending family and child poverty is indeed everybody’s  business and I can give you this pledge today, that it will be very much at the heart of the work of the next Conservative government.

Right.
Yeah, no, I don't think so. We're just -- I'm making a speech tomorrow for a group. That's a very, very good group, young people, and I don't know how they have it set up, but I'm going to Arizona. It's a great place. Great state.
I'm not worried about it. No, not at all. We watch it. We're very careful.
Yeah, we are. We are, look, we had this --
We had this going better than anybody's ever seen before. We had the best job numbers, the best economics, the best economy we've ever had. And then we had the virus come in from China and now we're rebuilding it again. We will be doing another stimulus package. It will be very good. It will be very generous.
You'll find out about it. And you'll find that.
Uh, I think over the next, uh, I think it's going to be bipartisan. I think it's going to be over the next couple of weeks, probably.
We do more testing than any country in the world by far, 25 million tests. Other countries do 1 million. Every time you do a test, as you do more tests that shows more and more cases. So we're so far advanced, both in terms of the quality and the amount. And we're doing all these tests and it shows cases if other countries aren't doing, or if we did slow it down, we wouldn't show nearly as many cases.
You're showing people that are asymptomatic. You're showing people that have very little problem. You're showing young people that don't have a problem, but we're doing so much testing 25 million tests. Nobody thought that was possible.
Uh, if it did slow down, frankly, I think we're way ahead of ourselves. If you want to know the truth. We've done too good a job. Because every time we go out with 25 million tests, you're going to find more people. So then they say, oh, uh, we have more cases in the United States. The reason we have more cases because we do more testing than any other country by far, by probably 20 million people.
So when we have more cases, you look at some of these countries that don't even report. You think China's reporting their numbers. Do you think that other countries, I won't mention names, are reporting that numbers? We are so far advanced in testing and in some ways that hurts us.
Uh, I'll do whatever I'm supposed to do. I don't think he wants to debate at all. I've seen that, uh, he wants to try and blame COVID for that too. He's not getting out of his basement. He's got a, you know, basement deal going. And when people see what's happened to Joe, uh, he wasn't good at primetime and now we'll see what happens.
Yeah.
There are thousands of cases all over, uh, thousands.
I don't like the system and I did pretty well in Colorado could have won Colorado, but, uh, I could have won. I almost, uh,
Uh, I can't tell you what it is. I thought I would have one Colorado, frankly. I love Colorado and the people like me and we have a lot of the similar values. Uh, we do a lot of economic development there. A lot of things are planned. No, I don't like mail-in ballots. I don't think it's good for Colorado either.
I don't know. Did the -- did they find anything in Colorado? I can tell you this. There are thousands of cases all over the -- One -- An example, an example, all over the country you have thousands of cases. A friend of mine gets a ballot, his son, unfortunately, passed away seven years ago. He gets a ballot for his son to vote.
That's one case, but there are thousands and thousands of cases. The other thing is with mail-in ballots, people can forge them. Foreign countries can print them. They get the same paper the same press --
Uh, I'm not ordering anything. I'm just, uh, we shouldn't have mail-in ballots. You should have certain things. If you can't be at a location like I'm here. And I can't vote in Florida, I'm at the White House. So you do something where that's taken care of. And that works out fine. But in California, they sent tens of millions of slips out, of balance out.
They put them in mailboxes, people take them, they take them from the mailman and they print them. They fraudulently print them. It's a very bad system. It's going to lead to a tremendous fraud and we're trying to stop it. Mail-in ballots are a disaster. And I'm sure they're not good in Colorado too.
Uh, we're doing, I think, very well. We just started.
I trust everybody. Yeah. I trust everybody. We're doing very well. I had a lot of the same people on the first campaign.

To my left Melissa DeRosa, the secretary to the governor. To her left, Rob Mujica, budget director. Let’s talk to you about where we are today. This is a situation which none of us have ever seen before, and it manifests itself in many different ways. There’s economic anxiety, people are out of work. What does this mean? Unemployment insurance? Will it cover the bills? There’s isolation. This fear of the unknown, this misinformation. You put it all together, it is very disorienting, to say the least. If you are feeling disoriented, it’s not you, it’s everyone, and it’s everywhere, and it’s with good cause.
Today is Saturday. You know how I know today is Saturday? Because my alarm clock said Saturday when I woke up this morning, but if you drive around, it doesn’t seem like Saturday. Saturday’s the day that people are off work, except people were off work yesterday. Saturday’s the day that the traffic is lighter, but the traffic was lighter yesterday. So it’s literally one day blending into the other, and just as a matter of perspective, a matter of context, it feels like it’s been going on forever, but it really hasn’t.
New York State had its first case of COVID just 27 days ago. New York schools closed only 10 days ago. The New Rochelle “cluster”, which was the highest cluster in the United States, which, thanks to the good work of our health department, has now come down, that was 18 days ago when we started the school closings in New Rochelle and we started the testing and the drive throughs. The overall shutdown of nonessential workers was only eight days ago. It feels like a lifetime.
Perspective. Well, how long does this go on? How long do we expect it? China, which was the first test case, first case was 12 weeks ago. That’s when it started in China. South Korea started nine weeks ago. Italy, about eight weeks ago. So keep it all in perspective during this disorienting time, where one day is just blurring into the next. A lot of people ask me, “Why is there so much talk about the ventilators? I never heard about a ventilator before.” You’re not alone. I never really heard about a ventilator before either, but every emergency situation is unique, and every emergency situation winds up focusing on an issue that you would have never thought of before.
We’ve been through emergency situations, Superstorm Sandy, we needed 1000 portable generators immediately. Whoever heard of needing 1000 portable generators? We had flooding in the northern part of the state, we need 700 miles of sandbags. Whoever heard of needing 700 miles of sandbags? So there’s always a particular circumstance that winds up developing in these situations that really you could never anticipate, and in this situation, it is about a ventilator. Why? Because the majority of these patients, they’re not coming in needing surgery. It’s all the same, it’s a respiratory illness, their lungs are damaged, they’re having trouble breathing, they have a cough and they all need a ventilator, and that is the peculiarity of this situation.
Compounding it is usually when we equip a healthcare system, people are usually on a ventilator for three or four days. With COVID patients, they are on for 11 to 21 days. That then compounds the ventilator issue. Not only do you need more, but people are on them longer, so you need even more, and that increases the problem. I think the President was right to use the Defense Production Act. What the Defense Production Act basically says is, I’m not going to ask private companies to help out, and it’s great that we have volunteerism, et cetera, but the Defense Production Act gives the federal government significant leverage to actually say, “I need these produced and I need these produced by X date.” Now the federal government still pays, they pay an increased cost for the accelerated production, but it gives the federal government the ability to do that, and when it comes to ventilators, they are the necessity in this situation.
What do I do as governor? Basically I ask people who know, I ask the experts a lot of questions, and just staying on the ventilators, “Well, what if? What if? What if? What if we can’t get the ventilators? What do we do if we don’t have enough ventilators?” Then you use bag valve masks. What is a bag valve mask?
This is a bag valve mask. This is what you do if you have a person who needs a ventilator and you don’t have a ventilator. The way this works is it’s basically a manual ventilator, and someone squeezes the ventilator, the bag, continuously. This looks easy. I guarantee if you do this for any length of time, you see how difficult it winds up being. This is the alternative if you don’t have the ventilator. We are actually buying these. We’ve bought about 3000. We’ve ordered about an additional 4,000 of these big valve masks. We’re even talking about training National Guard people to learn how to operate this device, which is relatively simple to operate, but you need a lot of people to operate this 24 hours a day for each patient. So those are bag valve masks. They’re the alternative to ventilators. Short answer is no thank you. If we have to turn to this device on any large scale basis, that is not an acceptable situation. So we go back to finding the ventilators, because we need the ventilators. Well, you need 30,000 ventilators. Do you really need 30,000 ventilators? Look, I’m not a medical expert. Even the medical experts can’t tell you what you’re going to need here at the high point. They do numerical projections, and then you plan based on the projection, you plan based on the data, based on the science, based on the numbers. The data says at that high point of need, you could need 140,000 hospital beds and you could need 30,000 ventilators. That’s what the numerical projections say. So we’re planning for that “worst case scenario” which the models predict. Maybe we never get there, maybe we flatten the curve and we slow the infection rate so we never get to that point, and that’s what we’re trying to do, and we’re working on that day and night, but if we can’t flatten the curve, you can’t slow the infection rate, you hit that apex, make sure you’re ready for the apex, and that’s where the 30,000 ventilators come in.
I have no desire to procure more ventilators than we need. On a very practical basis, the state is buying most of the ventilators. The ventilators cost between $25,000 to $45,000 each, so they’re very expensive, and you’re talking about a state government that frankly is already, from a position of revenues, in a terrible position, because we’re not collecting any revenues, literally. So I don’t want to buy any more ventilators than we need to buy on a very parochial basis, I don’t want to pay for them, and after this is over, we’ll have a great stockpile of ventilators, whatever we do, but the state has no interest in inflating the number of ventilators that we actually need. Something interesting about the price of ventilators. When we started buying them, they were about $25,000. Now they’re about $45,000. Why? Because they’re in such demand and there’s such competition to buy the ventilators, which I’ll touch in a moment.
The government has sent us 4,000 ventilators. Those 4,000 ventilators are not currently in use. Why? Because we don’t need them currently. What we’re doing is we’re planning for that apex, we’re planning for the critical need and making sure we have the equipment to staff the beds for that critical need. We’re not at that critical need where projections change, but the models say you’re 14 to 21 days away from that apex, we call it, when that curve hits the highest point, but when that curve hits the highest point, it is too late to try to acquire what you need. Acquire what you need now. That’s the concept of putting together a stockpile, and that’s the process we’re going through now. We only have 14 to 21 days, so it’s not a significant amount of time, but do everything you can to get ready now.
There’s an old expression, “You go to war with what you have, not with what you need,” which is true. When the bell goes off and you have to go to war, you deal with what you have, because it’s too late to do the preparation. The but on that is until you’re in that situation, do everything you can do to be prepared for it. If they tell you you’re going to go to war in 14 to 21 days, then spend the next 14 to 21 days getting ready everything that you would need when you actually have to go to war. For us, the war would fully engage if and when we hit that apex, and that’s why everything we’re doing now is in anticipation of that. Flatten the curve so the apex never happens. God forbid the apex happens, make sure we have as much of the equipment, staff, et cetera, that we would need for that moment.
A few updates. They still forecast the apex to be 14 to 21 days. Again, that changes on the modeling. Every time the case load goes up or down a little bit, that affects the calculation on the apex. What do you need at the apex? 140,000 beds. That’s hospital beds, dormitory beds. We’re working on that every day, and we’re getting closer and closer to that 140,000 number. PPE equipment. Right now we have enough PPE in stock, and all the local health systems say they have enough PPE in stock, short term. Nobody has enough long term, so we’re still buying and was still talking to the federal government about acquiring more PPE.
There is a concern among healthcare professionals, because the CDC guidelines suggest a different protocol for PPE and masks depending on the condition, and apparently there is a crisis set of guidelines that the CDC puts out for how many gowns, how often you change your gown, how often you change your mask, et cetera, in a crisis, and the CDC has put those crisis guidelines in place, and many healthcare professionals are concerned that those guidelines do not adequately protect the nurses and the doctors and the healthcare staff that are working on this issue. Dr. Zucker is looking at that. If we believe the CDC guidelines don’t protect healthcare professionals, then we will put our own guidelines in place. You have a bed, you have the equipment, you need the staff, and that’s where we’re working on bringing more reserved staff and putting that reserve staffing capacity in place, and that’s going very well, and then back to our favorite ventilator quest.
Word to the local health systems. We need the local health systems to think more holistically. In other words, you’ll have a regional health system, Western New York, Central New York, New York City, and they’ll have a number of hospitals. You can have a single hospital get overwhelmed within that system. You can have the staff get overwhelmed. You can have one hospital where they run low on supplies. The local health systems have to change their orientation where it’s not hospital by hospital, which is the normal culture. Every hospital is free standing on its own, and is its own entity and buys its own equipment, has its own staff, et cetera. I need the local health systems to change their orientation and operate and plan as if-
… And operate and plan as if that system is one. If you see a local hospital getting overwhelmed, shift to an adjoining hospital. Both within the public system and the private system, you have public hospitals and then you have private hospitals, voluntary hospitals. We have to stop operating as individual hospitals and they have to operate as a system, and I need the local officials to do that. So patients can and should be moved among those local hospitals as the need requires. Staff can and should be moved among those local hospitals as circumstances require. State Department of Health has not only advised that, but has mandated that. It’s not the normal operating culture, but it is a necessity in this situation, because depending on where a hospital is, you’ll have hospitals getting overwhelmed because they’ll happen to be in an area where there are not a lot of other hospitals or because that’s a hot zone, cluster zone, that hospital gets overwhelmed.
All right, shift, cooperate, plan as a local health system. May come a point where the state steps in and actually allocates among local health systems. This is when I said the other day, you may have patients from downstate New York being moved to upstate New York. Why? Because if the entire local health system in downstate New York gets overwhelmed, or the local health system on Long Island gets overwhelmed, and the Long Island health system says to me, “look, we’ve allocated, we have eight hospitals. We have allocated everything we can among our eight hospitals. We’re still overwhelmed.” Well then we’ll shift the burden, literally, to a different health system. And I just want them to anticipate that and see that that’s coming.
We have asked the pharmacies to cooperate above and beyond here, and to do free home delivery. There are long lines at pharmacies right now. That’s not good for anyone. I’m going to be speaking with some of the major pharmacy chains today to ask if they would be cooperative, but this would be a very big benefit. I understand it’s a hardship on the pharmacies to provide home delivery. I’m asking them to do it free of charge, but it will make a very big difference.
Also, the department of health is monitoring the density and activity. In the New York City parks, specifically on the playgrounds. This has been a problem. We spoke about it last week. The New York City Mayor, de Blasio, and the Speaker, Cory Johnson, have spoken to this. They gave us a plan. We accepted the plan. The plan is premised on the fact that people will reduce the density in playgrounds. No basketball, no contact sports, social distancing. There have been reports that that is not happening and it’s not in compliance. Speaker Johnson has made this point and I believe he’s right. So if the density compliance is not working on a voluntary basis, we could get to a point where we will close those playgrounds.
So I again ask the people in New York City, especially young people, please take this seriously for yourself and for others, and let’s do it on a voluntary basis. We’re also now administering 1100 tests of the hydroxychloroquine and the zithromax. This is the prescription that the president has been very optimistic about. We hope to be optimistic also, but we’re now using it on a large scale basis, particularly in the New York city hospitals, and we’ll be getting results soon.
Javits will open Monday. I was there yesterday. It’s a 1000 bed emergency hospital. It is amazing what the Army Corps of Engineers did in a short time. It was about one week, and the progress they made is really extraordinary, and I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart. The Army Corps of Engineers, the National Guard, which is our workforce that we call out in all these situations. I’ve worked with many of them and I know them after so many situations together. But they showed up and they’ve really done a great job, and this should open on Monday.
The USNS Comfort is going to be on its way. As of today, I’m told, the president is going to be seeing it off. It should be here on Monday. That will bring 1000 beds. It also brings medical personnel, which frankly are more important than the beds in this case, and it has operating rooms, et cetera. We’ll use this to backfill and take pressure off a hospital, so a hospital can backfill onto this 1000 bed facility. I hope it gets here Monday and I will greet it with open arms.
I spoke to the president this morning, actually just before I came in today. I apologize for being a few minutes late. And the president approved four new sites, four emergency medical facilities. One in Brooklyn at the Port Authority cruise ship terminal, it’s called. One in Queens at Aqueduct race track. One on Staten Island, and one in the Bronx at the New York Expo Center. I went and toured these sites yesterday. They are perfect. Well, not perfect. None of this is perfect. They are appropriate and suitable to bring in large scale medical facilities. They’re 100,000 square feet, 120,000 square feet. They’re open, they have electric, they have climate control, et cetera. So this is going to be a big advantage. This is going to will add another 4,000 beds, and there’s one in every borough in New York City, which was important to me. Every borough knows that they have a facility and they’re getting the same treatment that everyone else is getting. I’m a New York City outer borough person. You don’t know that classification unless you’re from New York City. They’re out of borough, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronxville is the outer boroughs. Manhattan is the inner borough, but they never call it an inner borough. Everyone is being treated the same.
We’re adding to that bed capacity to get to the 140,000 beds. We’ve added 695 additional beds, South Beach Psychiatric Center on Staten Island, which is opening up. We have the Westchester Square Bronx, 200 beds, Health Alliance in Ulster County, 235 beds. So you see again, we’re trying to have facilities all around the geographic location that’s experiencing the increase. We’re also making another shift where we’re going to go to COVID-only hospitals, where people in those hospitals will just have the COVID virus. So the staff that is there is basically working with one type of issue, as opposed to a normal hospital setting where you can have people with heart ailments and other medical issues, and on top of them the COVID patients.
The health commissioner has given us good advice. It’s smarter to keep the COVID patients separate. You don’t want a person who goes into a hospital with one situation developing COVID because they happen to be exposed. So this is smart and we’re going to isolate 600 beds for just this treatment. South Beach, again, Westchester Square and SUNY Downstate, which is in Brooklyn. This shows you the coverage that we’ll have when all of this is said and done, and you’ll see it’s equally distributed and it’s significant and in truth, many locations have been constructed, adapted, modified, and it’s been done in a very short period of time. Again, all this in contemplation of the apex, if we’re lucky, the apex never happens.
The New York State Department of Health has gotten approval by the FDA to start a new test, which is an antibody test, where we can test individuals to see if they were in fact infected by the virus, resolve and now have the antibodies so they have an immunity to the virus. This is being done here. It’s managed by our health department. The FDA has given us approval. Department of Health is working with private hospitals to actually enact this now, so this is happening now and this, it could be a big breakthrough if that happens.
On the theory of risk/reward ,we’re supposed to have a presidential primary election that’s coming up on April 28th. I don’t think it’s wise to be bringing a lot of people to one location to vote. A lot of people touching one door knob. A lot of people touching one pen, whatever you call the new device on the ballots. So we are going to delay that and link it to an election that was previously scheduled on June 23rd. The June 23rd date is for state legislative races and congressional races. We’ll move the presidential election to that date. Ironically, I had advocated that or beyond that date all along anyway, so there’s only one election and people only needed to come out once. Everybody wants to vote. Everybody wants this, do their civic duty, but don’t make me come out and vote 11 times. Put the elections together so I can go to the ballot once, and this will actually do that.
We are also extending the tax filing deadline to July 15th. This is good news for individuals, for businesses. You don’t have to file your state tax return. You file it with the federal tax return on July 15th. It’s bad news for the state of New York on our parochial level. That means we receive no revenue coming in until July 15th. This is the increase in the trajectory of the number of cases. You see, it goes up again. The number of people tested, we tested 17,000 people yesterday. Again, we’re testing more than any state in the country and more than China and Korea have tested. Total tested is up to 155,000. Number of new cases, 7,681. You see the state getting more and more covered. Just a handful of counties that have not reported any positive tests. This is the summary. 52,000 people tested. 7,000 currently hospitalized, 1,700 ICU patients, 2,700 patients discharge. That’s up 681. Remember people going to the hospital, people get treated, people leave. Remember, most people never go into the hospital. 80%, they self resolve.
Most impacted states, state of New York, 52,000. Next is our neighbor in New Jersey, 8,000. Then California, 4,000. But you see the reports nationwide that other states are finding it. Other cities are finding it. I believe you’re going to see more and more of that. But again, in comparison, you take California, 4,000 cases, compare that to the situation we’re in with 52,000 cases. People say I advocate for more help for New York with the federal government and I ask for more things than other states are asking for. Yes, respond to the need. Respond to the need. We have 52,000 cases. California has 4,000 cases. I want California to have all the help they need, but I want to make sure the distribution of need is proportionate to the number of cases.
If you’re looking for good news today on the numbers, the number watchers, this is good news. I wouldn’t put tremendous stock in it, but it’s good news. We’re watching the trend, right? Because we’re trying to gauge when and if there’s an apex. The number of daily ICU admissions, which are the critical point for us. ICU admissions means people who need ventilators. Ventilators are what’s in short supply. The ICU admissions went down, only 172 compared to 374 the day before. You see the overall line is still up. The 374 was very troubling because that was a gigantic leap. The 172 may be a correction from the 374. I don’t like to look at the data on any one night. We averaged three or four nights to get a more consistent track, but this is good news, on a one day number.
The number of ICU admissions drop, as did the number of new hospitalizations drop. So there’s a correlation there that also affirms both, right? It affirms the ICU number and it affirms the new hospitalization number, but again, I wouldn’t put too much stock in any one number. You see the overall trend is still up, but you could argue that the trend is slowing. I say don’t argue, follow the numbers, get more numbers, whatever the numbers say. The numbers drive the policy. So we’ll track it every day and we’ll see where we go. The worse news, the news that is most depressing to me-
The news that is most depressing to me, and I’m sure every New Yorker, number of deaths is up to 728. Of that 728, what’s happening is, people are on ventilators longer. You saw that average length of stay on a ventilator, the longer you are on a ventilator, the less chance you are coming off that ventilator. That has always been true. It’s more dramatic in this situation. Since this has been going on a period of time, you are having more and more people now who are on ventilators for a longer and longer period of time, and those are the people we are losing. They tend to be people who came in with underlying illnesses, underlying respiratory illnesses, compromised immune systems. Not all of them, but most of them. But that doesn’t make it feel any better. These are still people who we’ve lost. We lost because of this virus. If they didn’t have this virus, they would be with us today. So I don’t accept the concept of, “Well, these were people who were old, and death is inevitable.” Yes, death is inevitable for all of us. Just not today, right? That’s the point. Again, total perspective, this is not a new situation, it’s not just New York, it’s not just the United States. This started in China, they have all of the data since China, and you have a very broad database to call from. Again on perspective, don’t forget the basics. I know people feel this has been going on for so long. Wash your hands. Washing your hands, by the way, is just as effective, healthcare professionals will tell you, as hand sanitizer. So wash your hands, don’t touch your face. I’m a big face toucher for some reason. My own face, I don’t touch anyone else’s face. Stay six feet away from people. The social distancing is important. And don’t get complacent. These rules are not just important in the beginning. You have to do this every day, so you have to stay disciplined about it.
General comment as to where we are. Rule one in almost any situation in life, certainly in government, certainly in an emergency situation, is to plan forward. Plan forward, plan the next step. Don’t be reactive, be proactive. Don’t wait to find out what the virus is going to do to you, anticipate what’s going to happen, and plan for the step ahead. We have been behind this virus from day one. We have been in a reactive posture from day one with this virus. We’re waiting to see what the virus does, and then we’re responding. The virus makes another move, and then we respond. No, you don’t win on defense, you win on offense. You have to get ahead of this, anticipate what’s going to happen, and create that reality now. That’s what we’re doing with the apex preparation. We don’t have that crisis today. We could have that crisis in 14 to 21 days. So yes, I’m creating a stockpile today for a possible reality 14 to 21 days from now.
I’m not going to wait for day 13 to say, “Oh my gosh, we need 30,000 ventilators.” It’s over, so get ahead of it, that’s our apex preparation plan. But beyond just New York, as a nation we have to start to get ahead of this in two areas, specifically. On purchasing, you can’t have a situation where 50 states are competing with each other to buy the same material. That is what is happening now. When I showed you the price of ventilators went from $25,000 to $45,000, why? Because, we bid $25,000, California says, “I’ll give you $30,000,” Illinois says, “I’ll give you $35,000,” Florida says, “I’ll give you $40,000.” We’re literally bidding up the prices ourselves. Now, every state, no one’s doing anything wrong. I’m here to protect New York, that’s what I get paid to do. I have to acquire the ventilators. I have to pay whatever I have to pay to acquire the ventilators.
I don’t mean to take them from other states. But when you have a system where you say to the states, “Okay, you go out and buy what you need to buy,” we all need to buy the same thing. We all need to buy PPE, we all need to buy N95 masks, we all need to buy ventilators. So we’re all shopping the same distributors, the same group, and it’s not even legally price gouging. I was attorney general, I don’t even think you have a price gouging case. This is just private market competition. My daughter, Cara’s, working on the purchasing team. They change the prices, you can see the prices going up literally, during the course of the day. So if the federal government organized this, if the states organized among themselves… Because you can’t have the states competing against the states. And then, by the way, when the federal government goes out to buy the same equipment for their stockpile, now it’s 50 states competing against the states and the federal government competing against the states.
So this is not the way to do business. We need a nationwide buying consortium. Either the federal government should say, “I’ll be the purchasing agent for the nation, and I will distribute by need,” or the states, which it’s hard to organize 50 states. I’m vice chairman of the National Governors Association, I’m going to talk to them about this. Maybe the states could come up with a voluntary buying consortium, and then we distribute by need. But this is something that has to be worked out, not just for this but for the future, because this can’t happen again. Also, we have to plan forward on testing. We’ve mobilized, we’ve scrambled, but this is still not where it needs to be. We need many more tests. There are still people who can’t get tests, and we need tests that are faster. There are other countries that are developing faster tests, developing home tests.
We have a rigorous approval process through the FDA and CDC in this country. It served us well in normal circumstances. These are not normal circumstances. I would say to the market, if you have a test, and a home test, and a state wants to take responsibility for monitoring the results of the test, God bless you. Because you can’t have a situation where you have a five day waiting period for a test. That’s five days for the person to be out there and possibly infecting other people. And if the goal is to open up the economy as quickly as you can, you’re going to need a much faster testing process to find out who had the antibodies, which means they had the virus in resolve, and who’s negative, and who’s positive. So you are going to need a much faster testing process. That’s the only way you get the economy up and running in any relatively short period of time.
I showed you, though, I’ll end where I began. You saw the number of days that this had been going on, only 28 days. School’s closed only 10 days, feels like a lifetime. This is not a sprint, my friends, this is a marathon, you have to gauge yourself. You have to understand that this is going to be a longterm situation. And even though it’s so disruptive, and so abrupt, and so shocking, it’s also longterm. And each of us has to do our own part to adjust to it. It is a new reality, it’s a shocking new reality. There is no easy answer. We’re all working our way through it, and we all have to figure out a way to get through it. My gratuitous two cents, “See if you can’t find a silver lining in all of this.” People say extraordinary things to me that I just pick up, anecdotally.
I was going for a walk yesterday with one of my daughters and Captain, Captain is my dog, and people come up with all these interesting ideas… Who’s painting their house? Because, they never had time to paint their house before. Who’s working on a project that they never got to? Who’s reading a book that they never got to do? Who’s writing a book? Few people say, “I’m writing my journals. I’m writing my life story.” You know, find a way. You have the advantage of time here, and you have the advantage of time for communication. I’ve had conversations with my daughters, hours long conversations, where it’s just us, just us talking, no place to go, she doesn’t have to go to work, she doesn’t have to run out, and they’re priceless. They are priceless. I’ll never get the opportunity in life to do that again.
You know, we’re going to get through this, and they’re going to go off, and find a boyfriend, and then do whatever they do. I’ve had conversations with my mother who can’t leave the house. And she’s in the house, so we take turns talking to mom, and talk to my mother for hours, and it’s special. It’s special. So yes, it’s terrible, and I’m not trying to say it’s not a terrible circumstance. But even in a terrible circumstance, if you look hard enough, you can find the little rays, a few rays of light. And people are doing it, and I think we all should. It’s going to be a marathon, but we’re going to get through it, and we will get through it. And we are going to be the better for it when we get through it. We will have learned a lot. We will have changed, and we’ll be different, but I believe that we’ll be different in a positive way. Tell me questions, comments you have.
I spoke to the president about the ship coming up and the four sites. I didn’t speak to him about any quarantine.
No, I haven’t had those conversations. I don’t even know what that means.
April 5th… Look, all of the projections on the apex are just that, are projections. April 5th is earlier than our state projection, so Dr. Zucker will get with the local health commissioner there to have that conversation. But this operates in two levels. First, you have a local health system. So Mayor de Blasio runs a very large public health system. And then you have voluntary hospitals, private hospitals, I’ll just call them. All those hospitals have to be planned and operating as one system. One hospital gets overwhelmed, which we’ve seen in New York City. You have to immediately, from a management point of view, be able to use the surrounding hospitals for support. So one hospital gets stressed, shift to the other hospitals. One staff gets stressed, shift to the other hospitals.
What I was saying before, “This is not how they think, it’s not how they manage, it’s not how they plan,” and it’s not. Take any analogy, school districts, right? Every school district operates like an isolated entity. There’s no thought that maybe this school district would have to cooperate with a neighboring school district. Yeah, well the hospitals have to. And each local health system has to do that, because you will have hospitals overwhelmed. Now, if within that hospital system, once you maximize all of your potential, you still are over capacity, then the state can help with additional capacity, either by one of two ways. Shift, shift some of those patients to less occupied health systems. Our health systems, Upstate New York, right now are not as occupied as the downstate ones. So either shift among health systems, or start to use the additional capacity that we’ve been creating in that locality.
I don’t even know what that means. I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable. And from a medical point of view, I don’t know what you would be accomplishing. But I can tell you, I don’t even like the sound of it. Not even understanding what it is, I don’t like the sound of it.
Excuse me, one second Jess. This is why it’s dangerous to answer a question until you actually know what the person said. Mandatory quarantine, if you’re talking about what we did in New Rochelle, that means a person in that area must remain in that home. If there in their home or in mandatory quarantine, if they meet a certain protocol. We never said you can’t travel outside of New Rochelle. We never said there was any geographic boundary to New Rochelle. If you said, “I want to go quarantine in my girlfriend’s house in the Hudson Valley.” All right, but you have to be quarantined. So we never said any geographic constraints. Mandatory quarantine is a scary concept because it sounds like you’re saying to people, you can’t leave this district. We never did that. I’m sorry, Jess.
I have heard that. I don’t know any details about that. I don’t know if anyone does. Does anyone know about Rhode Island?
But I haven’t heard, other than the news reports, and look you’re getting a lot of sensational news reports now. So everything with a grain of salt, sometimes two grains of salt.
It doesn’t mean I don’t like them and I wouldn’t like to be on the phone with them. But we’re in constant communication. Governor, for those of you can’t hear the question, Governor Lamont is the Connecticut governor who caught the bigger fish than me in our last fishing outing. Governor Murphy is the New Jersey Governor. We’re in cooperation. We’re coordinating like no States have ever coordinated before, but I haven’t spoken with them this morning.
Can the common cold throw off the swab tests? Can the common cold throw off the swab test? A direct question.
Common cold does not throw off the swab test. I have it on expert-
Rob, do you know?
Public hospitals or all hospitals?
The places that are getting the most funding now, because of what the federal government did are the hospitals. The hospitals receive significant funds, “for the Coronavirus,” but the Coronavirus expenses, you can basically equate to anything now in the hospital system. So the hospitals are getting more funding than almost any other area that the state budget covers. How much are the hospitals getting? Do you remember Rob?
Yeah look, we have no money. So life is options. The state has no money, but if you’re getting the federal bill at $100 billion for hospitals, for Coronavirus related expenses, they are doing better than anyone else.
Do you know?
Yeah. We haven’t had that conversation.
I’m sorry, who said that?
Howard.
They should allow one person in the room besides the person giving birth.
So two people in the room.
We can’t. The way they wrote the law, we can’t.
Can’t do what you can’t do. We can’t. That’s the way they wrote the bill. I told them 157 times, metaphorically, but that’s the way they wrote the bill.
We’ve acquired some.
Yes.
No, no.
Nobody’s contacted me. Anybody contact you?
Empire State Development said contact the Empire State Development Corporation. Eric Gertler, who’s the head of that and ESD is making the exceptions. We can go back and check with the ESD and find out if they’ve made any exceptions specifically.
No maximum capacity.
140,000 beds. Now, what’s interesting here is, which sounds daunting, but in this case you’re not doing an operation per se. You’re not doing open heart surgery. You’re not doing a lot of… These are people who have almost the identical problem which is a respiratory lung issue. And that’s why on one hand, it’s relatively simpler to set up a temporary hospital because you’re dealing with the same symptoms over and over. The compounding problem is they all need those ventilators.
We’re looking at that now. We’re looking at exactly that now.
We’re actively looking at it.
No. Short answer, no. We’re focused on the apex. We’re coming up the mountain. We’re focused on the point of the mountain because that’s our critical point. Your question Jesse, which is a good one is if you get on the other side of the mountain, what kind of drop are you looking for before you would say we’re open for business? We have not calculated that. I think before you get there, you could get to a broad distribution of a test, a home test, a faster test. So it wouldn’t just be the drop in the number of new cases. I think the real reform, the real innovation here could be get those home tests that other countries are starting to use and let people test themselves.
Well the CV test is easier than the antibody test. The antibody test, you have to go in and you have to have blood drawn. The CV test, they have CV tests that are at home tests and I think you could get to a point where you say, and some of them are relatively inexpensive, “Do the test. You’re negative, go to work.” Period and divorce it from the trajectory of new cases. If you actually had the testing capacity and that’s what I would be focused on. Also, I said to the FDA, give me the ability, myself, to go out and seek New York state, to go out and seek new tests, home tests. We’ll test them. We have 200 laboratories. We’ll do the clinical trials and let’s see if they’re right because you want to start the economy and I understand the rush to start the economy and everybody gets the concept, but the new tests I think are the fastest way to get there.
Dr., do you want to comment on that?
Okay, let’s take one more. Anyone who didn’t ask? There was no one who didn’t ask a question. It’s a nice feeling.
Look, I don’t know how you raise taxes on people who are out of work and their business is closed because government needs more funding. I don’t know how you do that now.
We lost another nurse yesterday. You know Jesse, am I shocked? No, these people put themselves in extraordinary danger. And we’re all talking about isolation and precaution and we’re all wiping every door knob. And then you have people who every morning get up and go out and deal with the unknown. Talk about losing control, totally uncontrollable. These nurses, the first responders, they are just so extraordinary to me as people, forget everything else. And these are not high paid people. It’s not that they are doing it for the money. It’s not that they don’t have families. They are just extraordinary and they prove it time and time again. But I’ve never seen a situation like this where their heroism is so obvious and the risk is so obvious and their public service just rises above. I mean I am in awe of what they do and I find that inspiring. I’ll tell you the truth. Every time I say, “Well, I’m feeling tired. I’m feeling this.” Forget me. I’m not doing a third of what these people are doing. So God bless and thank God for them and I’m sorry for their loss. Okay guys, thanks.
Same thing. It’s the same strategy and move that strategy with the volume. Thank you guys.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-09-23,"On the campaign trail, I used to always talk about the fact that wages weren't going up for people. They were down from 20 years ago, and people had one job. Now they were working two and three jobs, and they were making less money.
Well, I have good news for you. It was just announced that wages, for the first time in many years, for people in the United States, have gone up. I'm so happy about that. That means you're working hard, but you're, making more money, and that's going to continue. So, congratulations. Spend your money well.

Liam Byrne,United Kingdom,2015-11-08,"Conference.
As we’ve gone around the country what’s become clear is that people are now seriously worried about what this Government is doing to their families, their communities and our country.
This week is our chance to point to a different way now – and different possibilities for the future.
That is the single aim of the Policy Review Ed Miliband has asked me to chair.
After last year’s defeat, the easiest thing in the world would have been for us to turn in on ourselves.
Gaze fondly, lovingly perhaps, at our navels.
Sit around in a comfort zone.
Argue amongst ourselves.
Let’s be honest. Some of us quite like that.
But under Ed Miliband, we have to do it differently.
We’ve picked ourselves up.
Dusted ourselves down.
And got straight back out there once more, talking to people, who we came into politics to serve…
About what we got right.
What we got wrong.
And how we need to change.
What we have decided to do is go for the prize that no-one has achieved in British politics for 35 years.
One-term opposition.
A party determined to bounce back from defeat and back into office where we know we can make a difference.
So I suppose I should give you the bad news.
I know what many will want this week is a detailed 5 year plan.
A new budget.
Sorted out down to the last pound and penny.
I know the hardest question I get on doorsteps in Hodge Hill is where’s the alternative? Where’s your plan? What would you do different?
Sorry.
The easiest thing in the world would have been to sit in a committee room in Westminster and write a new manifesto.
But I can tell you now, it wouldn’t have got us very far.
It wouldn’t have delivered one-term opposition.
Because we can’t revise our policy, or reorganise our party, until we reconnect with the public.
And that is what this first year of the Policy Review has been all about.
We’ve taken the simple view: that policy has to start with politics and politics starts with people.
And that is why we got back out there.
Back in touch with over a million men and women, party members and affiliates.
150 events.
6,000 local residents, coming along in person.
20,000 submissions pouring in to our HQ.
And it’s not always been easy has it?
You never quite know what you’re going to get.
I’ve been doing policy review door to door in Hodge Hill.
I won’t forget the man in Shard End, who I disturbed in the middle of his dinner.
He came to the door. Wiped clean his moustache.
And, how shall I put this?
He confined his remarks to two words; it began with F, it ended with F, and there were five letters in between.
I said, shall I put you down as against?
But whether the conversations have been hard or easy, we’ve had them.
People have been incredibly generous and personal in the stories they have shared.
They’ve told us about their daily struggles.
Their worries about balancing the bills.
Their hopes for their kids. At school. At college.
Their memories; their observations.
Loves. Hates.
But above all their common sense.
People haven’t pulled their punches.
They’ve given it to us straight.
They thought we grew out of touch.
They thought we got it wrong, on issues close to their heart.
On immigration. On welfare. On control of banks.
And that is why they’ve told us to change.
I know at times this has felt like an exercise in gratuitous masochism.
It isn’t.
We can leave that to George Osborne.
People don’t expect us to get everything right.
But they do expect us to learn from experience.
Their experience.
Because for most people in this country, things are different from 1997.
Life hasn’t stood still.
Times have moved on.
Challenges have changed.
What we have heard from people is that there is a new centre-ground in British politics.
It’s not a place that the party gets to pick.
The centre-ground is where voters say it is.
Our challenge now is to change and move in and say once more the centre-ground is our home-ground, and this is where we fight.
Everything I’ve seen of the Tories tells us that we should be bullish if we choose to change.
I think we can be a one-term opposition because of the people in the centre-ground; they’re under attack from a Conservative party, that is not on people’s side
You can’t pretend that you’re on people’s side if you cut jobs, and childcare and tax credits.
And damage people’s chances to work and pay the bills – or treat the kids – or take a holiday.
You’re not on people’s side when you curtail the chances for children.
And you’re not on people’s side if your idea of responsibility means firing 12,000 police officers, putting charities out of business and singling out as the people who need a tax cut, the bankers who got us into this mess in the first place.
So this week is our chance to show that we’re the ones who get it.
– That we’ve heard what people said.
– That we’re up for the challenge of change.
– That we are back on the side of the majority.
This week, we’ll set out what we’ve heard about how people want a different economy not run on the old rules but new rules with a welfare state that works once again for working people.
And we’ll say how we think change should begin.
We’ll say what we’ve heard about the next generation.
Remember education, education, education?
It was an expression of our aspiration for youngsters.
This week, we’ll say more about how we bring that aspiration back alive for new times – in education, in jobs, in housing.
We’ll say where we think change should begin.
We’ll say what we’ve heard about how good people in this country want to rebuild a responsible country, with rules that bite at the top, the bottom and at every point in between.
And we’ll say how we think change should begin.
So this first year is just a beginning.
We put first things first because we know that Oppositions that stay in opposition look inwards, and not out.
And that is why I’ve always said that my hope is that this policy review will change the way we make policy.
Not in committee rooms in Westminster.
But through conversation with the public, our members and affiliates.
I know we and I need to work harder to get these debates out of here.
So if you want me to come along and listen, wherever you are, I’d be delighted. Give me a ring.
Because over the next week and over the next year, we’ll begin to set out the new ideas we think are right for the future.
New ideas for the new centre-ground.
New ideas that reflect one simple philosophy.
That for most people in this country, politics is about the personal.
It’s about how you get on at work.
It’s about the safety of your community.
The education for your kids.
The care for your parents, your husband, your wife.
It’s having the chance to earn a better life, to get the good things in life, to live free of fear.
In other words, politics is about the most important things in the world.
In everything I read this year, no-one put it better, than a guy called Andrew, from Newcastle upon Tyne who wrote this:
“People want straight answers from politicians not avoidance or waffle. Talk like people, on the street, in the pubs, in the factories and offices and give straight honest answers. Try to make Britain a fair society.”
That’s our test.
So I think if we get the politics right; if we’re passionate about how politics can make a difference, then and only then will the right policy follow.
That’s the way we earn back the trust to serve.
Get that right – and we’ll win.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2015-10-03,"So fantastic. Unbelievable. Ah, beautiful.
Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you, everybody. That's so nice, thank you. Wow.
It's such a nice feeling, it's crazy what's going on, right? It's crazy. This is incredible. We are going to make our country great again.
Thank you, everybody. That's. So nice thank you. Wow, it's such a warm feeling, it's crazy, what's going on, right, it's crazy, you know what it's raining, it's miserable.
There are people outside. I hate to say this maybe thousands, right? Outside and I was just doing a lot of selfies, a woman said I've been here, Mr. Trump in the rain for four hours, could I have a selfie and my people said, no, no, no, I said, absolutely you can. So I'm soaking wet now from standing in the rain, but that's okay, right.
What the hell, what difference does it make? I just want to thank you. I mean this weather and all that's going on it's amazing to have these kinds of crowds and we'll have it -- Oh, my hair looks good, oh, he's, my friend, he's my friend, yeah, looks good. Yeah, it's so -- and it is my hair actually I have to -- you always know if it's gonna be a wise guy reporter when they say it's not, you know then you... You're off to a bad start. But I will tell you, it is such an honor not only here all over the country, what's going on.
We have there's a movement going on here, they're tired, they're tired. I mean I didn't need this. I wanted to -- I would be very happy, honestly, I'd be very happy if Barack Obama were a great president and things were going great. I really would I'd be very happy I'd be very happy you understand when I say that, I love what I'm doing.
I love my business. I built a great company. I have tremendous fans, have thousands and thousands of employees. I've hired tens of thousands of people over the years.
I love doing it. Doral, The Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, so many buildings and just loving it. But I had to do this, I had to do this, I didn't want to do this. I had to do it.
You know, forty years ago Mitt Romney let us down, and prior to that, John McCain tried hard, but there was a big implosion prior. In all fairness, nobody could have done that I think Abraham Lincoln couldn't have done it at that point. But last time we should have won that election. We should have won that election easily and I backed him big, big league, I backed and I backed John McCain big league, but the last time he's won and I said you know what we're not gonna let that happen again, we're not because we're not gonna lose this time, we're not losing and so many things have taken place that have just gotten worse and you hear, you know, we have almost 100 million people that basically they're out of work and then you hear about we're down to 5.2% It's a totally phoney statistic, so if you look for a job, many people are looking for jobs.
If you look for a job, you can't get it, you stop looking for a little while to recuperate, they consider you employed, okay? This country has tremendous, tremendous problems and we're gonna solve them and you know I actually have been saying it lately over the last few weeks because I see the spirit. I see the great people. These are great people in this room. We went to Dallas, Texas.
The Mark Cuban said you can use the arena that's where the Mavericks play the American Airlines Center. Then I had like three days, I think it was on a Friday or Thursday. We were speaking on a Monday and it was a holiday and I had a few days to fill it up and we filled it up was 20,000 people so quickly in Dallas. We went to Mobile, Alabama, we at 35,000 people, you know, we started at a football arena, you know that we started because we had no choice we're in a hotel 500 seats.
A friend of mine said, from Mobile, is a great guy. He said, could you come down and speak in Mobile, I said yeah, it's great I'll do that. So he had a set up in a hotel, nice hotel, good people and it was 500 seats. He called me about a minute after we announced he said it sold out, so we're gonna move it to the convention center.
Do you mind that held 10,000 and he calls me about three hours later. He said the Convention Center can't hold it it's too big. So they took us to a football stadium, which was beautiful and we had 35,000 people and I was a short just this short little period of time. And then last week you saw that we were in Oklahoma and we had legit 20,000 people, I say more.
We had a band shell and we had a big park in front, a big, big park and it's funny because the Pope was there at the same time and he was in New York and then he was in Philadelphia. And this is crazy. They had helicopters circling over the over Oklahoma when we were speaking. So it's a bandshell thousands of people behind the bandshell.
We couldn't even see. I mean, I said what are they doing? They can't see, but there was no room in the park. So they had the helicopters circling over and it was beautiful to see and they had the helicopters circling over Philadelphia where the Pope was. Now they said the Pope had a million people and I had 20,000 and it looked like I had more, it's crazy.
Crazy. But no matter where we go and it's because it's real. Thank you.
Thank you, everybody. So incredible. We don't win anymore.
We don't win, you know, years ago prior to Vietnam, we never lost a war, right? We never lost the war. Vietnam was a loss, nothing else you can call it. And then after that we now we don't even think about winning. We were losing Iraq, we lose with ISIS, we move, I see a general, the other day being interviewed and they said to him, nice guy.
I don't really want a nice general, you know, generals bring back Patton. This was such a nice guy. I like MacArthur, you know, McArthur in the history of West Point. He had the highest marks, I'm very much into the world of academics, believe it or not, and he had the best marks in the history of it.
You know, I want these guys he gets off his plane with a corncob pipe in the high hat and it says Here I am you mess with me go ahead mess with me, you know it's different. So today they... They're interviewing recently. This general on television. First, we shouldn't be on television doing an interview right, right? You're supposed to be unpredictable I've been using that term.
They said I did this great deal recently and it was a great business deal and my other side and and they were tough, but I beat him and badly and they said they were interviewing this other side and they were nice. They said, you know, we don't like Donald Trump, but I have to tell you is really tough to beat because he's so damn unpredictable. We couldn't predict what his moves were and I said to myself, I didn't even know that I don't think of myself and I said to myself, our country has to be unpredictable. You know how about with like Iraq.
A number of years ago when Obama said we are leaving on whatever date October 1st in one year, we are let. So the enemy says I can't believe it, you know a big part of the enemy is ISIS and all. So they just went away, they said, why should we fight now we'll wait. So the day we leave, they go in and they just knock the hell out of everybody it's, unbelievable, how do you announce it? And frankly, he should have said we're never leaving.
We will destroy them, we are never ever going to leave. I never wanted to get into Iraq. You know, I was the one I'm the only one I didn't want to get in. I said you got to destabilize the Middle East.
Now with that being said, I'm the most military either there's, nobody that will build a bigger, stronger, better military than me. I hope never to use it. You know, I want it to be so strong nobody's gonna mess with us, they gonna say just leave them.Let's play around let's do this, but... But it's so -- when I -- when I see what we've done, so I said in '03 and '04, there was an article in fact in in Reuters and it was '04, and it said, don't go in, and it's not my normal thing.
Don't go in, usually, I'm the first one in. I don't go into Iraq because you're going to destabilize the entire Middle East because Iraq and Iran were the same thing in terms of power and they fight all the time. They were fighting that's what they do that's, why they fight it and guess what they're gonna be fighting, whether we're there, whether were -- they're gonna fight, that's what they do, they fight, okay.
All right. So they're fighting they're fighting and Syria is gonna be another beauty they'll be there for 29 years, fighting. Everybody fights ever. Lett's rebuild our country, you know, I mean it's time, but I said to him, I said if you go into Iraq, you're, gonna destabilize -- and the White House actually could, because I get a disproportionate amount of publicity, which is true.
In fact, tomorrow I might meet the press and this week with George Stephanopoulos, so we have Chuck Todd, good guy, he likes me much better now. Don't forget don't, forget that's with 16 people and I'm not a politician, thank goodness. No, no.
Of course, now I guess I have to say I'm a politician, but I'm certainly not. And yesterday the new poll came out, which is a big one and I was 25, way ahead of everybody. Way, way ahead. And the pundits will say, what's going on? We don't understand, what's going -- they're going crazy, you know, because I'm not in their wheelhouse, they always pick these senators who were worthless.
They pick all of these people. You remember what I was on the stage, and Rick Perry, who was a governor of Texas, with the glasses, you remember? And he was a nice guy, he was such a nice guy, then he became vicious. They all become vicious toward me and they start hitting me hard. I never hit first and they start hitting me and hitting me.
I said, what happened? He was such a nice guy two weeks ago. That. But, but it's been amazing. The polls have just gone up and they've been constantly going up and the press hates to report it.
I mean they hate truth. I don't want to sound like you know, but they Kate to report it. We had a case in think of this Florida, Florida. So you have a governor, Bush, who's in favor of Common Core, by the way, he wants Common Core.
How do you win an election? When you want your children in Tennessee, in South Carolina, in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in every place, educated by bureaucrats from Washington, how do you win? So you have Jeb Bush and you have Marco Rubio. So he's, a sitting senator and the others are governor from Florida and the poll just came out and I'm at 29 or 30 and they're much, much lower, one's at like 14 ones at 11 and I'm at floor while there actually and the new one for I Won't even mention that because that's like an above once at four in the new one, right? So you know, so here's, the headline Rubio surging past, think of this Rubio, who's at like 13, 14 in Florida, I'm at 30. Rubio, at the headline in the paper, will be a surging past Bush I said, damn it, I guess, now it's true I said, I guess I can't be doing too well in Florida 'cause I thought I -- you know, in Florida they love me. I love Florida I'm there a lot it's a great place, beautiful sunshine, but -- but you know what, so it says Rubio surging past Bush in the Florida, Paul, so I say, uh, damn, well, get me the poll, let me see if this is too bad.
I wonder where I am, I wonder how low. So, I'm at 30. I have to say they're very, they are very -- there are some good ones, but they're generally very dishonest.
So now what's happening is this, this is called political speak, which I hate -- I hate I had to sign an application the other day I had it said profession and I said I can't put down the word politician. So I said real estate, I just said, hey, you know, but so we have a situation now which is interesting because Rubio was mentored by Bush, right? We heard that. And everybody, you know, six months ago they said Rubio will never ever run. He won't do it.
And he's loyal to Bush because Bush was older and he was -- the Governor -- Rubio was a younger guy and you know it's the whole thing is so -- Who has better hair, Trump or Rubio? You tell me. So that's not a close one. So here's what happens.
So he was, you know, mentored and everybody said, well, he'll never run because we don't know, we know politicians, right, loyalty doesn't mean once by the way, where are the Gatlin's, where the hell are they those guys come here, Larry. Come here before, I'll tell you this crazy story, the second get up here this man just so you understand he's great and all that stuff and he's great with the singing of the voice and he's happily married, but before that, the women used to love him. But he used to live, can you believe it? He used to live in Trump Tower, made a great deal. I sold him a unit and he sold it for much more, which doesn't make me feel too smart.
I feel like some of these guys that they talk about all the time, but I sold him a unit in Trump Tower. He lived there for years and we became friends, he's a really great guy. And I want to thank you because I heard you put on a fantastic show before I got here.
And your brothers, they are friend -- Where are they, Larry? They are great. That will you? Thank them all for me, plays the whole group, what a group. Thank you very much. And here's, a friend of mine who's, a guy he's the New York slicker, would you believe that, huh? So anyway, so with Bush and with Libya, so what happens and very interesting, I said, well, you know, I would say he won't run, but I know how disloyal politicians are and they're all-talk-no-action.
So maybe he'll run, but I don't know who knows. So it ends up that Rubio announces. And then I see Bush and I see Rubio now Bush is absolutely furious. Rubio is, you know, doesn't care about Bush, couldn't care less even though without Bush, maybe he wouldn't be there.
And what happens. And by the way, Rubio is the worst voting record in the United States Senate, hears they go for luck now he says, well, I'm running for it well. But you have other senators running and they do just fine, right, including Ted Cruz and others. But they're doing, you know, they're going back in voting.
So he's there was one, right? But forget that I don't want even mentioned it, pretend I didn't, hey, pretend I didn't say it right, pretend that is. So Rubio, so what happens now I say, but they don't like each other and everyone saying no, no, their dear friends. Then I see Bush and they're asking, well, are you upset with Marco Rubio? You mentored him. I -no.
He's, a dear friend, he's a dear dear friend, that's the politician's bacon. Then they said to Rubio. What do you think of Bush? No, he's a dear, dear friend. I love him very much he's a dear friend and I'm saying to myself, I won't use a bad word, 'cause every time he used a bad word, they say Trump cursed, right? They all say use, please.
I can't. You know the sir is not as good without a little extra emphasis, you know, but I want to do it. Because CNN -- every time I use a bad word, CNN, and ABC that did such a phone, oh, Donald Trump use the bad word, the bad word. You know, the bad word, there was nothing, it was nothing it's what they use every night at home, believe me.
So anyway, so they go. So they go and I'm saying, look at this, look what's happening, they're starting to get and all of a sudden the last week they're really going at it. Folks, I love to watch it, I love to watch it. So now they're going and they don't like, but see it's, it's really politicians, all talk, no action, they talk, talk, I love him very much.
I love him very much. They hate each other be honest, okay. You know one of the reasons we're doing so well. When I heard I heard is that true Bush was down to four in the poll.
Wow, that's, that's, that's a low number, that's a good poll, that's a good that's a good one. That's a big poll that's actually you know it's actually too bad, that's a... That's a big drop. So what happens is there now and they have to go after each other. They don't want to go after me because everybody that's gone after me is down the tube.
So they're not going to do that, they want to wait. They want to be the last man stands to be the last man standing to take on Trump, okay. I look so forward to finding out who I'm ultimately going to face, I look so forward to it. So, you know, we're going to see and it's going to be very interesting, but the world of politics is a different place.
And you know I've always I was the fair-haired, boy, nobody knows more about it than me. They say, what do you know about politics? I've contributed to everybody, Democrats, Republicans, everybody love -- Marsha's here, she loves me, they all love me, everybody because that was my job to be loved. I'm actually one of the -- one of the magazine's said Donald Trump's a world-class businessman, which is a very nice thing. It's true.
I happened to be, but you know what, you have an obligation to your company, to your employees, to your family. You have to get along with everybody. You get along with everybody. But they sort of said, what do you know about politics? I was the fair-haired boy, prior to running, once I ran, I was on like what's he doing, running he's, supposed to be handing money to everybody, he's supposed to giving campaign contributions.
Why is he running? Why? But it was interesting and now I'm becoming a little mainstream because I've been on the top of the polls, how many weeks? The guy who said 4%, he really knows, many weeks, right months actually.
So I've been up there months and actually, they thought two weeks ago the numbers may be slipping. You know I went up here's a great story, I love these stories. Do you like these? So as we can get -- yep, I was interviewed by very nice woman. Savannah Guthrie and I had a really good NBC poll.
I was like a 25 or 26 and I went to 29 now that was NBC I'm being interviewed by NBC. CNN had a poll that I went down two points. Why, do you remember that? And every other poll has gone up, but the NBC was really nice that went up like a nice percentage. I was up almost to 30.
So she said in the CNN poll, I say, women, you saw the interview. I said why can use it you'll, NBC, why usually CNN that you CNN because the poll wasn't quite as good. I was still leading by a lot, right? But the poll isn't good. Now what happens is, so we had the OAN poll, which is, listen to this one almost 35, 35, 35 and that's a great poll that's a very sophisticated poll, you know when I hear 35 and that's 35 with 16 people.
So when I hear 35, you know what I want to do, I want to be one of these countries where they can call for the election the following week, you know, wouldn't that be great? You wait till you have a good week and you say, ladies and gentlemen, we are calling for an election tomorrow, let's see. I wish we could do that. But 35 when you have so many people running is an amazing thing. Do you ever notice the pundits? So I start, and my wife said to me and my daughter, Ivanka, did anyone ever hear of Ivanka.
My wife and my daughter, they said, you know, if you run you're going to win, I said, why do you say that? Because people really love you, they get tired of these incompetent people. They know you're good at what you do it's interesting, and I didn't really -- you know, I thought about it last time and I didn't do it. I thought about it very seriously. I was leading in the polls last time and I just said you know what and I renewed The Apprentice and they... Top people from actually Comcast and NBC, they came up to my office this year just before I announced and great people.
Steve Burke and Paul led me the head of reality television for NBC. They came up to my office and they wanted me to do more than one more season, seasons. But they put because you know we've been having. We had a great run right, but I'm not allowed if I run for president because of what's called equal time you're not allowed to do a show.
So I said I'm not doing it fellas. I want to make our country great again. I really think I could win and I turned down tremendous, you know, tens of millions of dollars. Why I do that? You know, nobody Mark Burnett called me says, I can't believe you're turning down an extension.
Nobody turns down biggest actors, they don't turn down an extension. I mean, look, who took my place on a Schwarzenegger, he's good, right? I really do. I think he's doing, he's a good guy.
So let's say, I mean you never know honestly, you never know how will anybody do when they signed me for The Apprentice. They send me for one season because they figured I'd be on for a few nights and they would fade. And you know, we've had the 15 copies, 15 copies, all of them failed, but they signed me, they didn't have any extension rights. You know why they don't want to waste the ink.
They figured up here and they all said, well, women will never watch. And if you don't have women watching a show, you can't have a success. It can't be successful. Women have to watch because if you don't have the women, they shell ratings, I've become like a ratings maven, okay? I've become the king of ratings.
So I said, I read this one horrible reviewer, nasty guy, he said the show, this is 12 years ago when I first went on, he said The Apprentice willl never be successful because why will women want to watch Donald Trump? Can you believe this? It's very embarrassing. Everybody, my kids look, my daughter, my wife, they all look on that's, so bad if my husband so sad it's so sad, so sad. So we go on the shows number 10, and then number eight, and then number six and then number two, and then number one. And you remember the finale was 28 million people.
It was like the biggest show. I actually wrote that critic back. I said, I want you to take it back, you know, but so, but you never really know what's gonna happen and then it was a success for many years and it was great and they wanted me to extend and I said, I can't do it and they didn't, believe me, so at the up-front, were they announced their programs, they went out and they announced that we are going to renew the apprentice with Donald Trump. They still didn't believe me, I said you don't understand I'm running and they renewed it and actually was confusing because a lot of people that wanted me to run said, what are you doing? They renewed the apprentice, you are doing it and what are you doing? I said I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it.
And then finally, I had to make a decision and I will tell you, a couple of people told me this Mark Cuban told me this. A lot of people told me and Mark's been really nice. And so many people have been nice, but it takes guts to run. It really does.
And I said to my wife, you know, I'm gonna do it and I'll never forget standing on the famous escalator, you know the escalator, right. Remember the scene with Melania in front of me waving very elegantly and Trump coming down, waving less elegantly, but I just took a deep breath and I said, let's go do it let's make this country great because it takes guts, it takes guts. And I'm so glad I did it. But the pundits were all saying, you know, I started off at six then I went to eight, then went to ten, and every week would go up and now I'm leaning by a lot what in one poll I'm leading by 20 points.
And the person that second who happens to be a very good guy, Dr. Carson who's a nice guy, really is a nice guy. But they said Carson, surging and I said, but I'm leading by 20 points. They don't, they never mentioned me it's like an incredible thing, I'm like the invisible man, everybody's surging, you know I'm leading, but everybody's surging.
So you know it's one of those things. But I tell you one thing I'll tell you one thing I'm really glad I did it because I have been received so warmly. I came in with a group of friends from New York actually and they said, Donald, are you nervous making the speech? I said no because there's such love in the rooms, all of them it's not like it's -- it's like it's sort of easy, you know, it's sort of easy. Now they said that and he was asking sits, you know, he's a friend who is a very successful guy.
And he said to me, man, he couldn't, he said he could never do it. He wouldn't sleep for months if you had to do that. And I said, you know it's, funny there's such energy and I mean, in Texas, in Florida, in New Hampshire, the other night we had 4,000 people. It was incredible.
In fact Bush had 100 people, I had four -- No, it's true, 4,000 and CNN covered both. And you couldn't tell the difference because they had it against the wall, we're here with Bush, more and then they go we're here at the Trump too. But they didn't say how many people, it's just so disgusting, but that's, okay. But everybody in the room knows is tremendous energy.
And I said to my friends, I said, you know, when you get up in front of that, many people there's like love, and it's love because they want to see something happen they want to see -- So you know, I'll give you a couple of examples quickies, but you look at the horrible Aranda now we all know it's horrible at 24 hours, but it's not really 24, it's 24 days it's not really 24 days because before you get there, you have to go through a whole process, okay, the one I think is the greatest is self-inspection where Iran does self-inspection, then there's another one where nobody really knows what it means. But if Israel attacks, Iran we're supposed to protect Iran, do you believe this. Think of it, but I look at it and you know doing The Art of the Deal, if so many people aren't coming in they're all wanting me to sign The At of the Deal and what happens is I look and I see and I see the incompetence and I watch Kerry, he has no clue what he's doing then they would have doubled up the sanctions and sat back for about two weeks. They would have been called and they would have been begging to make a deal, but they don't ask for the hostages they don't ask.
They didn't it wasn't that they didn't get him, they never even asked and they said we didn't want to complicate the deal. Now if it's me I say, listen before we start fellas let's do this. He had four hostages by the way used to be three. Now it's four, they took somebody in the meantime, a journalist, we have one over there because he's, a Christian he's, a pastor, he's, a good guy, I've met his wife twice, she's, terrific she's waiting for her husband to come home.
He did nothing wrong he's a Christian, that's why he's over there? The whole thing is crazy. So listen to this, so I would have said, fellas, before we start, he got four prisoners, meaning three, meaning now fou, you got to do us a favor, get him out, let him out good for you, good for us. Nobody wants them over there. You don't need him, you don't want him there.
In the worst prisons, I hear the worst, the worst places like people can't even imagine they've been there for years now. I would have said you got to get him out, you get him out now, you get him out fast, and you know what they would have done it. Yeah, it's the messenger, somebody else, somebody -- it's true, it's the messenger, I hate to say some, somebody else could say the same words and the answer's no, but I'm a good messenger I'm a very, oh they're not gonna play games with me. Believe me, I guarantee you one thing I guarantee and they're already down to go see because I've said this a number of times, if I win, you know there's a little gap between winning and going in and doing a good job.
If I win, they will be back so fast after that election night, you -- you watch Iran will say, ah, we've decided to release the prisoners, we've decided, I guarantee and I say that and I say that and they're watching and everybody's watching and you have an all these live television, all these cameras back there, but I'm watching and they're watching and let me tell you something, they will be home very quickly after that election. If I win that, I can tell you because Iran knows it's gonna be a whole different ball game, it's gonna be a whole different ballgame. So, so the other day, which was so sad, so they should have been back. The deal was horrible we're giving them $150 billion.
All the other things that you've heard a hundred different times, but we're giving them $150 billion. Now they're going over to Syria to help Russia that the one all said they're a rich nation, they got plenty of ammunition, believe me, and they're smart and they're great negotiators. So I heard the other day not for -- even though we have four, they want to make a deal for three they're going to let three go, but they want 19 people, they want 19 and they want many other things, no don't think of it. So they don't want three for three, four for four, we have four over there, they're not gonna give us three of the four they're gonna give us three of the four and they want 19 and they want as they said and many other things.
How do we take it? No, no that's why? Yeah, that's why these rooms are all packed that's why we have thousands of people standing outside, that's why. You just -- you just -- you just can't take it anymore. You just can't it's so incompetent and we negotiate in good faith and they'll get 12 or 14 or 15 people and we'll give them billions of dollars more and shit have been part of the deal. She's been part of the deal for nothing, zero, should have been part of the deal.
You got a -- you got great people over there. You got great people over there, they're waiting to be released and they don't come out and nobody knows what's going on. But that's the new thing, I heard 19 for three and we're not gonna get the fourth and they want many things beyond the 19 and we're negotiating. It's just sickening to see what's happening, just sickening, alright.
So we'll get off that subject, but it's just you know what it's emblematic of what's happening. Here's a quick weather one Bergdahl, you know Bergdahl, right, traitor, he's, a traitor, Sergeant Bergdahl. So he leaves he deserts, he's a deserter, remember the old days in the old days being deserters. Bob, in the old day's deserters we shot, right.
Well, I knew something was up when I saw his father being interviewed, I said whoa, whoa, whoa. What have we here? Whoa, whoa. Well, it's a whole deal, but anyone that was before I saw Bergdahl, but you know what? So Bergdahl comes out and Bergdahl, he leaves, he deserts, pure and simple.
The generals that went in to interview his group, the people that were with him all knew before they made the deal, that I figured. Maybe they didn't know, they knew that a colonel, they had a general, they interviewed all of these great guys, these great young soldiers. They said he deserted six people were killed, looking for him, right? They went out, they wanted to get him back. They didn't know he deserted at that time.
So they went out. They want to get him back. They were killed six of them. They say five, but it was probably six, young, incredible, courageous people killed, killed, probably killed viciously as bad as it can be.
You can imagine they were killed looking for this guy. So we get them back. Where do we get them back for? We give up five for one, so we get a traitor they get the five guys that they've wanted for 10 years that are right now out on the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us, okay, that's what we get and that's the way we negotiate. We have incompetent people in Washington, we have a president that doesn't have a clue.
And just to top that one off the other day I'm watching television and I see the newscast that Bergdahl -- Well, he may have some psychological problems and we don't expect that he'll be getting any prison time. Do you believe this? No, do you believe this? No, that and that's why that's what's happening that's and I say this is a movement, you know, they used to use the word, silent majority, and it sort of disappeared and they have different reasons. But we're not even a silent majority, we're like a noisy majority, it's noisy, there's, nothing silent and that's what's happening. All right? A couple of things, and maybe I'm gonna sound as exciting right now because that was really -- I mean, every time I talk about it, I just can't believe what we're doing, I can't believe and it's so big, it's, so important.
Nuclear, so important, we should have made a great deal and we blew it. We had a chance to make -- we had a chance yet we'll get him, don't worry I'll get him. You know, I made a lot of money purposely buying bad contracts for a very little I've had friends that they weren't bad and they had a lot of bad contracts I'd buy that. And I would make a lot of money with bad contracts.
Believe me, it's called to renegotiation it's called beyond renegotiation, we'll get them don't worry we'll be fine, we'll be fine. But God, so we're gonna talk for a couple of seconds about a few other things and maybe we'll take a couple of questions if we can. I don't know it's not set up, but who the hell knows? I have all day. I don't care.
So immigration, when I first announced I took a lot of heat Rush Limbaugh actually said, I have never seen anyone takes so much in coming because I brought up the subject of illegal immigration, illegal immigration. And I said, and I mean it 'cause I'm really good at building things. You got to see what I have in New York and Chicago and different places. That's what I do, I'm building right now, The Old Post Office in Washington believe it or another Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House.
Somebody said, will he move into the White House? The answer is yes, okay, yes. Right between Congress, right, between the Capitol and The White House and it's an incredible building, I'm, building Doral and building all this stuff. I know how to build and I hear about the wall. A lot of people agree, you know, about 12 years ago everybody wanted the wall and then listen to this one.
One of the reasons they couldn't build it because they couldn't get their environmental impact statements. Do you believe it's true? I've done a lot of research. They couldn't get environmental impact statements. You know, there was a snail or a daughter or something or a snake that was in the way that was nesting.
There was a snake that was nesting in the area, you know, within 153 feet of the wall, uh, our country what we're doing to ourselves? And Mexico, and Mexico they're friends of mine, they can't believe how stupid we are. They can't believe it, they can't believe it. And not only will we build a wall and it will be a real wall, did you see last week they had a truck going over the wall. They have a little wall it's about this size and they built a ramp, right, and they had a truck loaded up with drugs loaded up with drugs, a pickup.
Didn't even need a strong engine, had the small engine, not the big -- and they had a little ramp going up and down when they have the truck going back and forth like the craziest thing. No, no. Walls work.
So we're, gonna build a wall and it's going to be impenetrable, it will be a real wall and we're gonna take care of our Border Patrol people because they are great and they're not allowed to do their job. They're not allowed to do their job. I met with them that's why the white hat does so well, right the white hat that was one. And then when I met in New Yorker and the red hat, no, I was in Iowa with the Red Hat and now the red hats doing so well.
So it's a crazy thing and it says make America great, right, that's what it's all about. But so we're, gonna have, oh, there, it is right there, but we're gonna have a real wall and then they say, oh, the wall can't be built it's too expensive. Well, first of all, in China, the Great Wall of China built 2,000 years ago is 13,000 miles. This one you need really a thousand miles it's almost 2,000, but there are a lot of natural problems.
So you have, Jerusalem's a point, and that's why I say in Israel you have a wall that absolutely works, you talk to them, believe me, it works, and the walls work. If they're properly built, not walls this height that offenses and did you have that you can Sit that he actually break him down and walk right over them, okay. And our Border Patrol's not allowed to do anything and then you have the Anchor babies, you have a woman, she gets pregnant, she's nine months, walks over to the United States has the baby, congratulations. The United States, you take care of that baby for 85 years, okay.
And then -- and then the 14th amendment and then what happens is they also know you can't do that because you'll have to have a constitutional amendment, will take years. It doesn't it doesn't. I turned out to be right. I was a little lucky on this subject, to be honest with you because -- but then the great constitutional said, no, no they're having the baby it's an illegal person having the baby you don't have to do it and we will win in court.
. And I'm not only talking about from South America, from Mexico or Latin America, I'm talking about from China, they come from all over the world. They sit down to have a baby right there and we have them for the next 85 years or hopefully, they live a long time. We have them.
Our country is crazy. Do you know if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, it's virtually impossible, okay? Over here, they just walk in now Mexico, they're too smart. Their leaders are too smart for our leaders, that's all it is they're too smart, they're smart, they're cunning, they're sharp. They send people right through trains, go right through them and nobody gets off no hold.
Nobody, you go right into the United States and then we send them all over the country and we have all sorts of problems. Now we have a problem with a migration and I said I'm -- it's a terrible problem, the migration from Syria and other places, in my opinion. So I'm asked the other day, what do you do what a couple of weeks I said? Well, I guess you got to help you know on a humane basis, you feel badly, right? It's terrible. But then over the last couple of weeks have been watching and I say wow, that's really something because Obama now wants to take you and listen to this one.
You know they were talking about 3,000 and 5,000 and 10,000 it's a lot of people, 200,000, the new number is no, no think of it that's, you know, 200,000 that's like, that's, like an army, you know when you get two. So now I'm looking the other day and other people have noticed too and they're all men it's like where are the women now, not all, but there are mostly men, right? And they're also very strongly men, these are not people. And that first thing I said is these are men, strong, strong men, why did they're back fighting for their country? And then I said and it is true. Take a look when they show of course now the press is gonna show different sections where you know. But -- but no, I mean if you look at a random, you know, as they call it in polling if you random sampling you'll see tremendous numbers of young strong men.
So I don't want to say that's for sure and probably it's not, but that could be ISIS. That could be the enemy. You took it about hundreds of thousands of people coming into this country. We know nothing about them, there's no documentation, there's no papers.
They don't know, as he said, they're already and some are already. And by the way, hate to tell you. But there's, no documentation there's, no paper, they say, yes, I am so-and-so and I'm from Syria. Oh, well come on into the United States.
We have no idea what we're doing. Number one, it will cost billions of dollars to take care of him to get him over. You know, one of the great's I said, I will and I mean this and the reason I say it early because I want people to know and I even want them to know because it's all over the world what I said it was pretty controversial it's all Over the words, they know everybody knows, you know that's.
So ABC television, network, ABC, this reporter all mentions, then he doesn't say the whole thing, you know I give a thing, they could be ISIS they're all... All men. So many men, strong, young men, they go, they leave all that out. They have just one clip. If they come here, they will go back, I look like the worst human being on earth, right? They really it's it's, so unfair, it's, so unfair, but let me just tell you if they come in and if I win, they are going back, they are going back.
Okay, the amazing thing is and you know they have like so many people, so many different lines. They said well, you can't send it back. How would you ever get them back? I said, how did they ever come here? It's, unbelievable. They're talking about bringing them from Syria, so they can bring them, no problem.
We cannot get them back, it's terrible. And what I do like is a safe-zone. I do you take a big area in Syria, there's, plenty of land that's... One thing you have over there is no real estate problem it's, not a lot of people investing in Syria right now.
You get a big piece of land, safe, get a big piece of land, let Germany let all these other countries including the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, unbelievable wealth, by the way, they're not taking anybody, anybody they're not taking anybody. The Gulf states, I have so many friends in the Gulf states, they buy my apartments like crazy, I love them, okay, but there's one, they're not taking anybody. Now we're taking 200 thousand, but the Gulf states, next door, are taking nobody and they're not putting up much Money if any, if any, but what I would say is that you get the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia makes a billion dollars a day. You get the Gulf states, you get Germany because Germany, I mean they she... They're having riots over there.
Now Merkel was strong, now all of a sudden they want to get rid of her that's going to end up in not in a good situation, but you get these countries that are going through hell right now with a migration and they all feel guilty. You get them all to chip-in and you built a safe zone and then ultimately when that whole mess ends, whenever it ends and who knows, it could go on for a long time. But ultimately you let them go back to their homes, you let them go back, where they actually probably want to go. You know, if they probably want to go.
I mean, you know I have -- I have employees that work in different parts of Latin America, South America, Mexico, in parts of Europe that actually are not doing well. And I say what are you gonna do when you retire? Oh, Mr. Trump, I'm going back home. Really? You are -- They'll leave like, great areas.
They want to go back home because it's home, it's very interesting, isn't it? They want to go back home it's, ravaged in some cases, but when they leave their big thing is to go back home, it's very interesting. And these people didn't want to go back home sort of natural, right, it's sort of a natural thing. So we have to help them in that sense, but we don't have to help them where we take them into our country and we are going to give them documentation that's in Arabic we're going to give them all sorts of documentation. The whole thing is just, just crazy, so we're gonna help because we do have a heart, but we can't take them in the country.
Ad there is a... A problem. You could have a Trojan horse situation, you could -- this could be the ultimate Trojan horse. I don't think it is, it probably isn't, but the word probably is unacceptable, right? It's probably, I mean this one could be written about for a long time and you know they know how stupid our leaders are. They know how dumb our leaders are.
So they probably figure, boy, this is going to be easy we'll send a lot of people and a big percentage of them is going to be great fighters and ISIS or whatever enemy it may be because we got plenty between ISIS and Al-Qaeda and all of them. So where big percentage could be that and probably isn't, but it could be. It's not gonna happen, we get them out, okay. And I hope they don't come in.
I hope they don't come in. They shouldn't be allowed to come in, it shouldn't happen, that part of the world has to take care -- We can't take care of everybody. We can't do it.
We just can't do it anymore. We owe $19 trillion. You know last time I was here, I was in Nashville about a month ago, we had an amazing crowd, amazing crowd heroes who was at that event. Yeah, we had a lot of people, but we had an amazing crowd and like today, I mean incredible, and we were talking about 18 trillion and now it's 19 trillion it just goes up.
It's only gone up. And when Obamacare kicks in, which is really in 16, Obama is going to be playing golf on some of my golf courses, I think, okay, hippie guy, he won't care, when Obamacare kicks in, do you see what's happening to your premiums they're going up 40, 50%. You see what's going on when Obamacare kicks in, it's going to be unbelievable for our country, unbelievably bad, so expensive. So we're, gonna repeal Obamacare replace it with something much, much fun, so bad.
But the fact is what 19 trillion, we owe 19 trillion. We owe 1.5 trillion to China can you believe it, they take our jobs, they take our base, they take our money and we owe them one point five trillion. How does that work? I always told a magic act how about Japan. We are Japan the exact same amount.
We are Japan $1.5 trillion, 1.5 trillion. They sell us cars, we send them beef and they send it back. They don't want it. Their farmers don't want it, you know, okay, I blame them.
They want to do their own stuff, what do they want the United States for. So we send cars, the numbers are massively different. We send cars, they cut, they bring these cars over. We send a car over to Tokyo, right, like one Chevrolet, they send it back.
I bet you don't have a Chevrolet in all of Japan. Okay, so they send us, I see boats in Los Angeles, the biggest ships I've ever seen loaded up with cars, load it up from Japan and they're coming up there. Just one. It looks like a highway.
It looks like the Long Island Expressway just pouring out of the ships pouring out. We are them $1.5 trillion I'll think of it. We do this tremendous imbalance and we have a huge imbalance with Japan by close to $70 billion a year. We have almost $400 billion a year imbalance with China, 400 billion.
I mean how stupid are our leaders, how stupid are they? We can't go on that way. Now with China, we open our country, oh, free trade, free trade, it's wonderful, it's wonderful and I'm a free trader. I like free trade. The problem with free trade is you need smart people.
If you don't have smart represented free trade's a disaster. And I have Carl Icahn lined up, you probably heard, Carl's a great business genius and I have -- I have other the biggest, the smartest people, I know all of them. I know the good ones, the bad ones, the overrated ones, the ones that nobody heard that are better than everybody. I have guys lined up and believe me, we'll put them in those rooms gonna be a whole different ballgame, whole different ball game, you know 'cause, you know ultimately it is really a sophisticated it's, a sophisticated chess match, but I have the best people lined up.
I mean, think of it think if we can bring that down a lot and even break even, just break even, you saw there before. Do you know what that does to us? Do you know how that makes us? Essentially you're losing $400 billion a year? Okay? Think what I could do, you know, they all said, I came out with my tax plan and I was gonna read it to you, but you've all heard it right. You've all heard it. But -- but the truth is people said to me, well, I don't know it's a very steep tax cut and it is for the middle class, especially for the middle class.
And they said it's a very steep cut. Can you balance the budget balance, the budget there's so much waste and fraud in Washington when you start cutting... When you start cutting you're gonna balance the budget, believe me, you're gonna balance the budget. So we have that.
Our veterans are being treated like third-class citizens, and they're our best people. Our wounded warriors are the greatest, I see them, so I love these are incredible people. They went over there and they've been let down they've been let down by the politicians, the politicians don't have a -- you know, right now Iraq is negotiated just as I said, 2003, 2004 read the articles they wanted me to shut up. I said you make it a mistake, but just as we're talking right now, Iraq is negotiating with Iran to take over.
Iran is gonna merge in with Iraq. I said that was going to happen and Iraq has among the top three oil reserves in the world. Iran is saying thank you, United States we didn't have to fire a shot you're so stupid and nice a LAN is going to take over all of those reserves. They're gonna take over Iraq and Iraq is already going like come on in, come on in.
Please come on in it's, so sad it's so said the level of incompetence you have Syria going and you have Russia in there. Now if you remember Russia, Russia was the Soviet Union, right, and they went into a place called Afghanistan and they went bust it. They went bankrupt, they were fighting it for years. The Afghans are great soldiers, very smart, very smart fact I'm waiting for Obama to give an exact date when he's gonna leave, then doesn't just go away for a little while.
Then they'll come that's what happened in Iraq, we are leaving in 14 months, October 13th, we will be leaving the enemy says, hey, this is great news. Now think of this, by the way, think of this, even if you didn't mean it okay, because think of General Patton Burgher, think about what they're doing, they're spinning and a great -- they can't believe this. Think of Obama said the following: We're never leaving, we're gonna be there forever, forever and we're gonna destroy them and we're gonna do this, and we're, gonna do that, even if he didn't mean it. Then what he said, oh, I've had enough, let's get the hell out of these people are crazy, these people are crazy.
So now we have the same situation and that's gonna be a big bog down that's gonna be bogged down. And I can see already what's gonna happen with Russia and they think it's gonna be easy, it's not going to be easy and Russia doesn't want ISIS. I know they're hitting the other targets right now too, and we're supposed to be fighting, fighting for the rebels, but nobody knows who the rebels are, right. Remember Libya and how bad Qaddafi was and we're gonna fight for the rebels, well, then the rebels killed our ambassador in the worst way.
What happened to him and three other people and many other people, by the way, okay, remember that. Perhaps thanks to Hillary Clinton, correct, correct, correct, but -- but do you remember that and then you have Iraq with Saddam Hussein. I mean he was vicious, he was a violent guy, but you know what, there were no terrorists in Iraq that was that now it's the Harvard University of terrorism that's where they study terrorism right now. Anyway, you had no tell, you know what he used to do to the tears, a one-day trial, I'd shoot him, okay, that was -- and the one-day trial usually lasted about five minutes.
All right, right? You see it there's no terrorism there, there was no -- And remember this, when the World Trade Center came down, they didn't go back to Iraq. You know that, right, the families, the families got deposited on airplanes to go home because the husbands are going to do a great deed, they're gonna knock down the World Trade Center they're going for the Pentagon and they were going for other locations, okay. And you know where they went to another place, correct? They didn't go to Iraq, didn't go to Iraq? So we shouldn't have been in and then the way Obama got us out, we shouldn't a garden now that was the wrong way to get out. We shouldn't have been there and we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.
So there are a lot of -- lot of stupid people in Washington it's one of those things. I was gonna do a whole thing and I was gonna come up and read the Second Amendment and we have an incredible policy. You know they all wanted me to do policy and I kept saying needed.
I can -- dare it. I'll start off should I start off, really? So I put in Donald J. Trump, etcetera, etcetera. Protecting our Second Amendment rights, will make America great again and strong again, right.
The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. Now, this is in light of what's gone on with Oregon. You know, every time something happens, they blame, they don't blame mental illness that our mental health care is out of whack and all of the other problems. And by the way, it was a gun-free zone.
I will tell you if you had a couple of the teachers or somebody with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off... It's really sad and we can say that with respect to a number of places where that happens. But you have a gun how about the military event that took place three or four months ago where you had these highly decorated soldiers in a military area within not allowed. And this one soldier was like one of the highest decorate and they weren't allowed to have the guns and this whack job walks into such hearing them. Why are we having -- why are we having gun-free zones in a military camp? Okay.
. The Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right that belongs to all law-abiding Americans, right, I wrote this. The Constitution doesn't create that right, It ensures that the government can't take it away, right? Can't, they're doing all sorts of moves to try and take it away. Our founding fathers knew and our Supreme Court has upheld that.
The Second Amendment purpose is to guarantee our right to defend ourselves and our families. We need that. Like I have a license to carry in New York. Can you believe that.
Can you imagine? Somebody says, oh, it is Trump piece easy pickings what do you say? Right? Oh, boy. What was the famous movie? No. Remember, no remember where he went around and he sort of after his wife was hurt so badly and kill. I -- Honestly, Yeah, right, it's true, but you have many of them.
You have many of them. Charles Bronson right the late great Charles Bronson name of the movie come on. Ah, we're gonna cut you up, sir, we're gonna cut you up, uh-huh, B. One of the great movies.
Today you can't make that movie because it's not politically correct, right? It's not politically correct. But could you imagine what Trump? Somebody says, oh, all these big monsters aren't around he's easy pickings and then shoot. So this is about self-defense, plain and simple. It's been said that the Second Amendment is America's first freedom, that's because the right to keep and bear arms protects all of our rights, which is so true we're the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment protecting that freedom is imperative, absolutely imperative.
And I do a whole paper on it. All of these people, it's not the guns it's the people that these sick people. Defend the rights of law-abiding and it's important because they're trying to take your rights away, they say we only want a couple of bullets in the magazines.
Maybe you shouldn't have magazines, have a gun that fires one bullet. Have nothing defend the rights of law... Gun owners and that doesn't happen. So we have to do that. They, you know, they have background checks already in place and that was done in 1998 and people slipped through and our government's not doing a great job.
You have a national light to carry and you have the military bases. I mean, when you think about the military bases, so we laid out this policy I'm a very, very big Second Amendment person it's very important to me, it's very, very important.So you know, one other thing I want to say, I met with a lot of ministers and pastors the other day and I brought up one point that has been bothering me for a long time and it's the word Christmas. When kids say -- Do you ever go to a store now? Where it's just Happy Holiday and I say to the owner where -- where is the Christmas, and no, no, we don't do that. We don't do that anymore.
You can't use, you think of it, you can't use Christmas anymore. Okay. We have speakers set up for them, but it's you know obviously not the same thing, but it's it's an honor that they showed up and they're standing out there in the rain.
But I just want to tell you that we are going to do something special. There's, something special that's happening, there's something special and I see it everywhere. There is something special that's happening and look around at the people that are next to you.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you.

Nigel Dodds,United Kingdom,2016-04-21,"We gather today not only to rejoice in the Queen having lived a long and glorious life, but to celebrate the reign that encompasses so much of it as well as the lives of almost everyone over whom she rules today.
We must remember that the Queen was not born to this role. She was not an heir and not expected to ascend the throne. Instead, with her mother, father and sister, she was part of a loving and contented family, growing up in devoted respect of her grandfather, King George V, and in the shade of her glamorous uncle, the Prince of Wales. That peaceful life came to an end for the Duke of York and his family with the trauma of the abdication. With the support of Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother, and their loyal daughters, His Majesty King George VI ensured that the Crown remained at the heart of its people’s affections. Together, they embodied our will to defeat the supreme evil of living memory and win the war that ensured that civilisation, decency and democracy prospered, rather than perished, in Europe and across the world. Her Majesty, iconic and perpetual as she sometimes seems, is not a symbol; she is a reminder to us all of the generation who did great things and stopped terrible things being done to us. The great history of our nation, of which we can be truly proud, is not something that our Queen merely symbolises; it is something that she and her generation lived for us. Thank God that she and they did.
In deserved and romantic fashion, the Queen saw a dashing young hero enter her life after the war. In her choice of husband, Her Majesty has kept us all alert, invigorated and—more than once—amused. Their life together, rising to some 70 years, is a tribute to the character of both our Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Only yesterday, we saw the wonderful picture of Her Majesty, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and the young Prince George all together—continuity and change in one loving and beloved image. The gift of the Queen’s long life includes seeing the future that assuredly lies in store. We in the Commonwealth that she has done so much to sustain see that the Crown rests securely on a sure line of succession.
In a country such as ours and in the other realms over which she reigns, the crown worn by the Queen embodies our unity. In my corner of this kingdom, Northern Ireland, it will never be forgotten how steadfast the Queen was in her support for and affection towards our afflicted Province. From my time as Lord Mayor of the great city of Belfast, I can personally attest to her compassion and concern for those affected by the violence. Those dark days are, we pray, now over, but Her Majesty’s enduring interest and contribution towards peace in Northern Ireland continues. Her frequent visits and those of other members of the royal family are always warmly received right across the community. For that and so much more, we from Northern Ireland are immensely grateful.
Like most, I have known no other sovereign. We have been blessed through the generations to have one so dedicated to the service of our country and the Commonwealth. The nations of the Commonwealth are joining with us today in our tributes to the Queen. As we have been reminded, the Commonwealth is a powerful expression of the unifying and inspirational spirit of its great Head. It is but one of Her Majesty’s enduring legacies. She has been the rock upon which this country has continued to flourish and built a modern democracy so envied across the world. Her shining faith has been a constant and unwavering inspiration through times of national celebration and national occasion. In times of personal sadness, Her Majesty has exhibited the great grace that comes with great faith.
We are thankful for the wonderful life that God has given us in His servant Queen Elizabeth, and may He in his great wisdom and His great mercy be pleased to grant Her Majesty and we her people the continued blessing of having her reign over us for many, many more years to come. We wish her a very, very happy birthday. God save the Queen.

Barack Obama,United States of America,2015-09-23,"Good morning!
What a beautiful day the Lord has made!
Holy Father, on behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. I should explain that our backyard is not typically this crowded -- but the size and spirit of today’s gathering is just a small reflection of the deep devotion of some 70 million American Catholics. It reflects, as well, the way that your message of love and hope has inspired so many people across our nation and around the world. So on behalf of the American people, it is my great honor and privilege to welcome you to the United States of America.
Today, we mark many firsts. Your Holiness, you have been celebrated as thefirst Pope from the Americas. This is your first visit to the United States. And you are also the first pontiff to sharean encyclical through a Twitter account.
Holy Father, your visit not only allows us, in some small way, to reciprocate the extraordinary hospitality that you extended to me at the Vatican last year. It also reveals how much all Americans, from every background and every faith, value the role that the Catholic Church plays in strengthening America. From my time working in impoverished neighborhoods with the Catholic Church in Chicago, to my travels as President, I’ve seen firsthand how, every single day, Catholic communities, priests, nuns, laity are feeding the hungry, healing the sick, sheltering the homeless, educating our children, and fortifying the faith that sustains so many. 
And what is true in America is true around the world. From the busy streets of Buenos Aires to the remote villages in Kenya, Catholic organizations serve the poor, minister to prisoners, build schools, build homes, operate orphanages and hospitals. And just as the Church has stood with those struggling to break the chains of poverty, the Church so often has given voice and hope to those seeking to break the chains of violence and oppression. 
And yet, I believe the excitement around your visit, Holy Father, must be attributed not only to your role as Pope, but to your unique qualities as a person. In your humility, your embrace of simplicity, in the gentleness of your words and the generosity of your spirit, we see a living example of Jesus’ teachings, a leader whose moral authority comes not just through words but also through deeds.
You call on all of us, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, to put the “least of these” at the center of our concerns. You remind us that in the eyes of God our measure as individuals, and our measure as a society, is not determined by wealth or power or station or celebrity, but by how well we hew to Scripture’s call to lift up the poor and the marginalized -- to stand up for justice and against inequality, and to ensure that every human being is able to live in dignity -- because we are all made in the image of God.
You remind us that “the Lord’s most powerful message” is mercy. And that means welcoming the stranger with empathy and a truly open heart -- from the refugee who flees war-torn lands to the immigrant who leaves home in search of a better life. It means showing compassion and love for the marginalized and the outcast, to those who have suffered, and those who have caused suffering and seek redemption. You remind us of the costs of war, particularly on the powerless and defenseless, and urge us toward the imperative of peace.
Holy Father, we are grateful for your invaluable support of our new beginning with the Cuban people -- which holds out the promise of better relations between our countries, greater cooperation across our hemisphere, and a better life for the Cuban people. We thank you for your passionate voice against the deadly conflicts that ravage the lives of so many men, women and children, and your call for nations to resist the sirens of war and resolve disputes through diplomacy.
You remind us that people are only truly free when they can practice their faith freely. Here in the United States, we cherish religious liberty. It was the basis for so much of what brought us together. And here in the United States, we cherish our religious liberty, but around the world, at this very moment, children of God, including Christians, are targeted and even killed because of their faith. Believers are prevented from gathering at their places of worship. The faithful are imprisoned, and churches are destroyed. So we stand with you in defense of religious freedom and interfaith dialogue, knowing that people everywhere must be able to live out their faith free from fear and free from intimidation.
And, Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet, God’s magnificent gift to us. We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to changing climate, and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations.
Your Holiness, in your words and deeds, you set a profound moral example. And in these gentle but firm reminders of our obligations to God and to one another, you are shaking us out of complacency. All of us may, at times, experience discomfort when we contemplate the distance between how we lead our daily lives and what we know to be true, what we know to be right. But I believe such discomfort is a blessing, for it points to something better. You shake our conscience from slumber; you call on us to rejoice in Good News, and give us confidence that we can come together in humility and service, and pursue a world that is more loving, more just, and more free. Here at home and around the world, may our generation heed your call to “never remain on the sidelines of this march of living hope.”
For that great gift of hope, Holy Father, we thank you, and welcome you, with joy and gratitude, to the United States of America.
",White House Welcome Address for Pope Francis,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamapopefranciswhitehousewelcome.htm
Baroness Anelay,United Kingdom,2016-03-02,"Good morning everybody. May I begin by thanking Louise Ellman MP, Chair of the APPG on the Baha’i Faith for organising this event; and Jim Shannon MP, Chair of the APPG on International Freedom of Religion or Belief for his kind words of welcome.
This morning I would like to set out the British Government’s policy on human rights and, specifically, on freedom of religion or belief. Given the role of the APPG for the Baha’i Faith in organising this seminar, I would like to say a few words about the situation for the Baha’i in Iran; and because of its relevance to us all I will touch on Daesh. I hope that this will give you an idea of where the Government stands on these issues, and a sense of the kind of things we do around the world to protect and promote human rights.
I have said before, and I think it bears repeating, that freedom of religion or belief is not just an optional extra alongside the broad spectrum of human rights. It is a key human right in and of itself.
Support for human rights and freedom of religion or belief is at the heart of everything we do, not just in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but right across government. We maintain a constant dialogue on all aspects of human rights with our international partners. We do not shy away from raising concerns with them, both in public and in private.
This Government has pledged to “stand up for the freedom of people of all religions – and none – to practise their beliefs in peace and safety.” We are committed to defending this right, as set out in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
With intolerance on the rise almost everywhere, from the Middle East to Europe to the United States, this commitment is needed more than ever. We are working hard to promote and protect freedom of religion or belief, through our bilateral and multilateral work, through project work and through increasing the religious literacy of British diplomats. We have refreshed and strengthened our approach since the last election. Our focus is on three themes.
Democratic values and the rule of law.
Strengthening the rules-based international system.
Human rights for a stable world.
Our support for the principle of freedom of religion or belief runs through them all.
Let me give you some examples.
Where Freedom of Religion or Belief is not fully respected, it follows that democratic values and the rule of law are not fully implemented. That is why we fund projects which bridge divides, promote tolerance and encourage dialogue.
For me, one of the keys to success is education. We need to ensure that children appreciate – from the earliest age – that for a society to flourish, everyone must be valued equally. One of the projects we fund helps to develop lesson plans for primary school teachers in the Middle East to help them instil these values.
Mindful of democratic values and the rule of law, we also lobby governments when we have concerns about individual cases of discrimination or persecution. For example, in Sudan, we lobbied on behalf of Meriam Ibrahim, who was born a Muslim but charged with apostasy for marrying into the Christian faith.
Our diplomats in Geneva and in New York are strengthening the rules-based international system by working to ensure that resolutions focus on the full definition of Article 18, not just the issue of religious intolerance.
Elsewhere, we raise issues with individual countries bilaterally, or under the Universal Periodic Review process.
For example, in Burma, we have raised our deep concern at the rise of hate speech and religious intolerance with the Burmese authorities and will continue to do so, both publicly and in private.
We have supported a number of projects, including developing relationships between Burmese youth and different religious communities, and arranging exchanges between activists on religious freedom in Burma and Indonesia.
In Iraq, we are funding a project to prevent intolerance and violence toward religious communities by strengthening the ability of youth and civil society to advocate the right to freedom of religion or belief.
Finally, and perhaps of most relevance to the discussion today on the link with economic prosperity, we focus on human rights for a stable world.
We do this because we know that tolerance and inclusion are the building blocks of stability, not hatred and discrimination.
We do this because we know stability is the foundation for prosperity.
And we do this because we know that where people live together in harmony, and economies flourish, extremism struggles to take root.
I know that there are representatives of the Baha’i faith here today, and I would like to pay tribute to the work of the All Party Parliamentary Group in raising awareness of the suffering they have endured. This Government deplores all forms of persecution, including persecution on the basis of a person’s faith – no matter what that faith might be.
Turning to Daesh, there is no need – for this audience or any other in the civilised world – to detail the ways in which their intolerance is abhorrent.
What I will say is that we are determined to defeat this poisonous ideology. We welcomed the UN Secretary General’s Action Plan for Preventing Violent Extremism, with its focus on tackling the root causes. We will support its implementation, not only in the UN but also in individual states, as they develop their own action plans.
Our counter-extremism work has a conscious focus on human rights and on freedom of religion or belief. In many places we are working with faith leaders.
In Bangladesh, Mali and Nigeria we are helping communities resist the lure of extremist ideologies.
In Iraq we are tackling intolerance by inspiring key community leaders to become defenders of freedom of religion or belief.
In Goma, Eastern DRC I visited a UK-funded project supporting reconciliation and tolerance for sexual violence survivors. We are working with faith leaders to build community support groups, challenging the stigma many survivors face.
I hope that all this shows our absolute commitment to improving human rights and supporting and promoting freedom of religion or belief around the world.
I will turn now to the focus of today’s discussion, the link between religious freedom and prosperity.
I admire the pioneering work of my fellow speaker Dr Grim in this area. His work is needed, because sadly economic cost is often more persuasive than human cost, no matter the misery we see on our TV screens night after night.
Governments need hard economic proof, and to validate it they need proof from different sources.
So it makes absolute sense to get business engaged in this agenda, lobbying alongside governments and civil society.
I know that Professor Grim is keen to see improvements in the business climate to ensure that individuals from all backgrounds and faiths can realise their potential.
I am pleased to say that we in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office already support his aims through our international engagement. Through our work on business and human rights, we regularly encourage other governments to create an operating environment that is stable, secure and transparent.
To conclude, I hope I have shown just how seriously we take the issue of Freedom of Religion or Belief.
I very much value the efforts of parliamentarians, NGOs, think tanks and others, and the emerging work on the link between religious freedom and economic prosperity. I look forward to further collaborating on this with you.
I will finish with the words of the Prime Minister: “Now is not the time for silence. Now is not the time for inaction. We must stand together and fight for a world where no-one is persecuted because of what they believe.”
It is an inspiring call to action – let’s work together to make it a reality.
",2016 Speech at Seminar about Freedom of Religion and Economic Prosperity,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/baroness-anelay-2016-speech-at-seminar-about-freedom-of-religion-and-economic-prosperity/
Philippa Whitford,United Kingdom,2020-02-11,"I, too, welcome the Secretary of State’s statement, and we support the use of powers to maintain isolation, as they are critical for the health and safety of other people in the country. I would, however, also support that they must be transparent and proportionate. I also welcome that the four chief medical officers across the UK are working together on this issue.
The Government are advising symptomatic returnees from the high-risk countries, but should that not be all people returning from high-risk countries? We simply do not know what the prodromal part of the incubation period is, nor how infectious someone actually is before they have any symptoms at all. I have to say that I was surprised to see the bus drivers, who were driving those on their way to quarantine, sitting in the front seat in shirt sleeves besides someone in full hazmat gear. That seemed to me to send out a rather strange message.
It is also advised that only those from Hubei province should self-isolate even if asymptomatic, but we see from the cases in France that this is spreading very quickly and we already have 40,000 cases across 28 countries. Therefore, if anyone is flying and going through airports, there is the risk of spread, of simply being on an aeroplane with someone coming from China.
I welcome the funding for vaccine research and the expansion to 12 test centres across the four nations, but what publicity campaign is planned to educate the public upfront not to go to their GP and not to go to accident and emergency, where they will actually spread it to someone else? I understand that the information is there on the Scottish NHS inform system or 111, but if someone is not looking maybe we need to be proactive about the message.
Finally, the UK is no longer part of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. While we are able to take part in the early warning and reporting system during transition, we are no longer part of the decision making or central procurement of vaccines. How much of that system is the UK still able to be part of at the moment during transition and in the long term? Does that perhaps raise up the agenda some of the areas of co-operation that need to be sought with European Union agencies?

George W. Bush,United States of America,2002-06-19 00:00:00,"Good morning. The global devastation of HIV/AIDS staggers the imagination and shocks the conscience. The disease has already killed over 20 million people and it's poised to kill at least 40 million more.
In Africa, the disease clouds the future of entire nations and threatens to hold back the hopes of an entire continent. In the hardest-hit countries of sub-Sahara Africa as much as one-third of the adult population is infected with HIV, and 10 percent or more of the school teachers will die of AIDS within five years.
The wasted human lives that lie behind these numbers are a call to action for every person on the planet and for every government. So, today, my administration is announcing another important new initiative in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
I want to thank Secretary Powell and Secretary O'Neill for their hard work on this project. I appreciate so very much Tommy Thompson, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for he and his staff's vision and implementation, procedures for this project. I want to thank Andrew Natsios, the Administrator of USAID. I appreciate Dr. Tony Fauci, the Director of NIH, for being here, as well, of the Allergy and Infectious Diseases Department. Thank you, Tony, for your hard work on this. I appreciate Senator Bill Frist and Senator Jesse Helms, for their vision on this issue. And I appreciate Jim Kolbe, from the House of Representatives. Thank you all for being here today.
One of our best opportunities for progress against AIDS lies in preventing mothers from passing on the HIV virus to their children. Worldwide, close to 2,000 babies are infected with HIV every day, during pregnancy, birth or through breast feeding. Most of those infected will die before their 5th birthday. The ones who are not infected will grow up as orphans when their parents die of AIDS. New advances in medical treatment give us the ability to save many of these young lives. And we must, and we will.
Today I announce that my administration plans to make $500 million available to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This new effort, which will be funded during the next 16 months, will allow us to treat one million women annually, and reduce mother-to-child transmission by 40 percent within five years or less in target countries.
I thank all the members of Congress who supported this initiative, especially Senators Frist and Helms. Their visionary leadership on this issue will mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of children.
Our initiative will focus on 12 countries in Africa and others in the Caribbean where the problem is most severe and where our help can make the greatest amount of difference. We'll pursue medical strategies that have a proven track record. We'll define specific goals. We will demand effective management. When the lives of babies and mothers are at stake, the only measure of compassion is real results.
We have a three-part strategy. First, in places with stronger health care systems, we will provide voluntary testing, prevention, counseling, and a comprehensive therapy of anti-retroviral medications for both mother and child, beginning before delivery, and continuing after delivery. This combination has proven extremely effective in preventing transmission of the HIV virus.
Second, in places with weaker health care systems, we'll provide testing and counseling, and we will support programs that administer a single dose of nevirapine to the mother at the time of delivery, and at least one dose to the infant shortly after birth. This therapy reduces the chances of infection by nearly 50 percent.
Third, and most importantly, we will make a major effort to improve the health care delivery systems in targeted countries. This will allow more women and babies to receive the comprehensive therapy. It will allow for better and longer treatment and care of all AIDS victims. And it will lead to better health care in general for all the country's citizens.
We'll help build better health care systems by pairing hospitals in America and hospitals in Africa, so that African hospitals can gain more expertise in administering effective AIDS programs. We'll also send volunteer medical professionals from the United States to assist and train their African counterparts. And we will recruit and pay African medical and graduate students to provide testing, treatment and care.
This major commitment of my government to prevent mother-to- child HIV transmission is the first of this scale by any government, anywhere. In time, we will gain valuable experience, improve treatment methods, and sharpen our training strategies. Health care systems in targeted countries will get better. And this will make even more progress possible. And as we see what works, we will make more funding available.
The United States already contributes approximately a billion dollars a year to international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. In addition, we plan to spend more than $2.5 billion on research and development for new drugs and new treatments. We've committed $500 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and other infectious diseases, and we stand ready to commit more as this fund demonstrates its success.
Today's initiative is not a substitute for any of these efforts. It is not a substitute for further U. S. contributions to the Global Fund. This initiative will complement those efforts, and it is an essential new step in our global struggle against AIDS.
Today, I call on other industrialized nations and international organizations to join this crucial effort to save children from disease and death. Medical science gives us the power to save these young lives. Conscience demands we do so.
Thank you very much.
",Speech on New Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Paul Sweeney,United Kingdom,2017-08-10,"class=""hs_Para"">It is a great privilege to deliver my maiden speech in a debate about such a tumultuous event in our nation’s history. I congratulate the right hon. Member for Glasgow South (Stewart Malcolm McDonald) for his kind introduction earlier today.
class=""hs_Para"">It is customary for a new Member to make some reference to his predecessors, and reflecting on the introductory remarks of Richard Buchanan in his 1964 maiden speech, I noted that he declared:
class=""hs_Para"">“If it were within my power to introduce a new tradition to this House, it would be that hon. Members who are making their maiden speeches should do so from the Dispatch Box so that they might lay their trembling hands upon it and give some support to their quaking knees”.
class=""hs_Para"">On rising to speak today, I can thoroughly attest to my sympathy for those sentiments. The only consolation is that I will not have long to wait for relief, as I will have the first opportunity to address this House from the Dispatch Box next week as shadow Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. I can only hope that it will provide more ample support for my trembling limbs.
class=""hs_Para"">The area of Glasgow that I represent has a remarkable and diverse history, and that is reflected in the diversity and vibrancy of the people who live there today. From its early origins at the northern frontier of the Roman Empire, it has subsequently been vital to Glasgow’s development, even though it was formally incorporated into the city only in 1891, when Glasgow’s territory was doubled in size. The Molendinar Burn, on the banks of which the founder of Glasgow, St. Mungo, established his cathedral and with it the surrounding town, flows from Hogganfield loch, the fresh waters of which also nourished what is the longest established business in the city of Glasgow—Tennent’s brewery. The brewery was founded at the Drygate in the 1550s and its amber nectar has slaked the thirst of many a Glaswegian over the centuries.
class=""hs_Para"">Other engineering innovations were pioneered there, too, most notably the Johnston Dogcart, which, in 1895, was the first motor car to be built in Britain by railway engineer George Johnston in Balgrayhill. The first road trials took place in the dead of night, with Johnston driving the car at a reckless 12 mph on a 20-mile journey around Glasgow. For this apparently reckless behaviour, he was charged with contravening the Locomotive Acts by driving his horseless carriage during prohibited hours along Buchanan Street—then, as now, the main shopping thoroughfare in Glasgow.
class=""hs_Para"">Today my constituency retains this fine automotive industry pedigree in the form of Allied Vehicles, the largest manufacturer of specialist taxis and mobility vehicles in the United Kingdom, which employs more than 650 highly skilled people in Possilpark. This high-value manufacturer is also ingrained in the community, supporting many excellent projects such as Possobilities, which supports disabled people in the local area, as well as the highly successful Glasgow Tigers speedway.
class=""hs_Para"">As my friend the hon. Member for Glasgow South mentioned earlier, our engineering prowess was also critical to supporting Britain’s war effort during the first world war. Springburn’s railway works gave themselves over to the production of munitions for the duration of the war. Throughout this period, they were responsible for producing war material such as the first tanks and aircraft. The works also produced the first modern artificial limbs for wounded servicemen.
class=""hs_Para"">The directors of the North British Locomotive Company even offered their headquarters building to the Red Cross, as existing hospitals were insufficient to cope with the war wounded. It opened on Christmas eve 1914. Wounded troops would be transported directly from the southern channel ports to the hospital on specially converted ambulance trains. By the end of the war, a total of 8,211 servicemen had been treated.
class=""hs_Para"">My constituency of Glasgow North East was created at the 2005 general election by the amalgamation of the Glasgow Springburn and Glasgow Maryhill seats. Both areas have previously enjoyed excellent representation from exemplary parliamentarians. Although my seat was once described as a Labour citadel, there were even two Conservative Members in the interwar period, though that was thankfully a brief dalliance. The metaphorically and physically towering legacy of my antecedents was brought into sharp focus when I recently had the opportunity to venture into the Speaker’s House and was confronted by a 14-foot-high oil painting of Lord Martin of Springburn and Port Dundas. If there was ever a more effective device to make his successors feel simultaneously inspired and inadequate I have yet to find one.
class=""hs_Para"">Michael Martin succeeded Dick Buchanan as the MP for Springburn from 1979 to 2009, which of course culminated in his election as Speaker of the House of Commons from 2000 onwards. His parliamentary career, spanning seven consecutive general elections, was selflessly committed to the service of others and epitomises the opportunity that the Labour movement has offered for the advancement of working-class people over the last century. He rose from being a Springburn sheet metal worker and shop steward to become the Speaker of this House. I was particularly gratified to meet Lord Martin just last week, and he told me of his delight that his seat was now back in “safe hands”, as he put it.
class=""hs_Para"">My first ever experience of party political campaigning was in the Glasgow North East by-election of 2009, after a telephone call from Gordon Brown’s wife Sarah drew me from my exam revision to help William Bain hold the seat for Labour. As someone who was also born and raised in the local area—we were both the first members of our respective families to benefit from a university education—William proved to be a dedicated, industrious and committed champion for our city and its communities during his time in the House, speaking vociferously in opposition to the coalition Government’s vicious and self- defeating austerity policies during his tenure as shadow Scotland Office Minister.
class=""hs_Para"">Before I had the opportunity to meet my immediate predecessor, Anne McLaughlin, I watched her maiden speech with great interest when she delivered it almost two years ago to the day, in July 2015. I was particularly impressed by her yearning passion for improving the lives of her constituents and restoring civic pride to our communities—a passion that I share deeply. Anne cited the example of the project to restore the historic Springburn winter gardens, the largest glasshouse in Scotland, as a totemic symbol of our mission to continue regenerating a community that is still contending with the challenge of urban dereliction. As one of the founders of the project, I was personally delighted that Anne made such a generous endorsement of our efforts in her maiden speech. I would also like to thank her for the friendly and good-natured election campaign we conducted in June and I look forward to working together in areas of mutual interest in the future.
class=""hs_Para"">Having recently been involved with the development of Labour’s new industrial strategy for Scotland, I am excited about the opportunity before us to unlock a new era of prosperity with the application of coherent, long-term thinking about the development of more high-value industries in our country, and I look forward to pursuing that vision with vigorous enthusiasm in this place.
class=""hs_Para"">Another recurring subject for my predecessors is housing, particularly exploitation by private landlords and the mass clearance of housing in areas such as Springburn. All Glasgow Labour MPs have stood firmly in the tradition of John Wheatley and his famous Housing Act of 1924, which provided state subsidies for house building to build a land fit for heroes. It led directly to the creation of Glasgow’s municipal housing system, and saw large-scale building of some 57,000 new homes in new districts such as Riddrie and Carntyne in my constituency between the wars.
class=""hs_Para"">Heroines such as Mary Barbour led the struggle against rapacious landlordism during the first world war; she led the women of the city in the 1915 rent strike that ultimately forced this House to legislate to control rents for the duration of the war. I am delighted that my predecessor Maria Fyfe, who represented Glasgow Maryhill for so many years, has successfully campaigned for a statue commemorating Mary Barbour and the Glasgow rent strikers—only the fourth statue of a woman to be erected in the city of Glasgow.
class=""hs_Para"">As a result of the efforts of my predecessor Michael and others, Glasgow pioneered the modern housing association movement that saved many of the traditional Victorian tenements in areas such as Dennistoun and Springburn. By writing off the city’s £1 billion housing debt, the last Labour Government enabled an unprecedented renewal of its housing stock, led by organisations such as ng homes; more than £100 million has been invested in improving housing standards in my constituency. These physical improvements are about not just the sandstone, glass and slate, but reinvigorating the very soul and character of our city, and what it means and feels like to be a Glaswegian from one generation to the next.
class=""hs_Para"">My duty as a Labour Member of Parliament has been crystallised by those observations. The people of Glasgow North East sent me here because they despair of the Tories and yearn for the vision of hope and prosperity that Labour has offered them under the inspirational leadership of my right hon.
class=""hs_Para"">In 1948, this House, having witnessed the disastrous effects of two terrible world wars, was told that the welfare state had been established to remove the shame from need and to create a society with solidarity at its foundation. Today it is our solemn responsibility to do everything in our power to defeat this Government and restore that abiding principle in our society. That is why the people of Glasgow North East sent me here, and I will do my utmost to repay their faith in me through how I acquit myself in pursuit of that endeavour in this House.
",2017 Maiden Speech in the House of Commons,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/paul-sweeney-2017-maiden-speech-in-the-house-of-commons/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-06-02,"Hello everybody. So we'll be going to the UK. I think it'll be very important. It certainly will be very interesting. There's a lot going on in the UK. And I'm sure it's going to work out very well for them. As you know, they want to do trade with the United States, and I think there's an opportunity for a very big trade deal at some point in the near future.
And we'll see how that works out. Our country is doing incredibly well. Our businesses are doing well. We're going to clog up the border. We're going to stop the border. Mexico is making hundreds of billions of dollars for many, many years. And they have to do something about the border. Everyone is coming through Mexico -- including drugs, including human trafficking -- and we're going to stop it or we're not going to do business and that's going to be it. It's very simple.
They're sending a big delegation right here to the White House on Wednesday, as I understand it. And we'll see what can be done. But if it's not done, you know what we're going to be doing. And I'm really okay with that.
I don't like them at all.
Well, people ask me questions -- like you; you're asking me a question. Don't ask me the question if you don't want me to talk about it.
Go ahead.
Talk -- talk up.
They have to stop the illegal flow -- the flow of drugs; of immigrants, illegal immigrants -- people that have not gone through the process. We have people -- we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. We have a list of people -- literally, millions of people -- applying for membership and citizenship to our great country.
These people walk in; nobody knows who they are. They don't know the problems. We have a lot of crime that's able to walk in. Our Border Patrol has apprehended record numbers of people. They're doing an incredible job. We're starting, as you know, the process. We're getting them out. So they may think they get in because the laws are no good, but they're getting out.
And for that, the laws are very good. So we're taking them out almost as fast as they come in. But it's a big, big job. And if the Democrats would wise up and give us the proper laws -- the proper immigration laws -- we could solve the problem in one day. But, in the meantime, Mexico can do it. And, by the way, beyond the immigration laws, Mexico should be doing it. What Mexico has been doing to this country for so many years -- like 25 to 30 years -- with the drugs and human trafficking and illegals all pouring through Mexico -- no good -- and caravans.
No good.
I don't like what's happening in Syria with Idlib. I gave people a warning seven months ago. I stopped it. I don't like what's happening. They're killing indiscriminately many, many civilians. Bad things are happening over there.
Well, I think I may meet with him. He's been a friend of mine. He's been very nice. I have a very good relationship with him. I have a very good relationship with Nigel Farage -- with many people over there. And we'll see what happens, but I may meet with him. They want to meet. We'll see what happens.
The Australian situation is interesting, but the relationship is very strong. No, we're doing a very -- a very special relationship with Australia.
Go ahead.
You have to talk up. We have a helicopter.
Well, let's see what happens. I mean, look, we're doing our best to help the Middle East to get a peace plan. And he may be right. I mean, most people would say that. I think we have a good chance, but we'll see what happens. In the meantime, Israel is all messed up with their election. I mean, that came out of the blue three days ago.
So that's all messed up. They ought to get their act together. I mean, Bibi got elected. Now, all of a sudden, they're going to have to go through the process again until September? That's ridiculous. So we're not happy about that. But if we can get a Mid East peace plan, that'd be good. And when Mike says that, I understand when he says that because most people think it can't be done.
I think it probably can. But, as I say often, we'll see what happens.
No, I made no bad comment. Thank you.
When did this come up again? What are you, back -- are you back --
Are you back -- what -- four months ago? No.
Well, you know why? Because people want her to do work. People want the Democrats to pass immigration laws. They want the Democrats, very importantly, to do something on infrastructure. They want the Democrats to reduce drug pricing. That's the reason they're all getting booed.
There is no basis whatsoever for impeachment. None. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no crime. The crime was by the Democrats. The crime was by the Democrats. There is no legal basis for impeachment. It's a big witch hunt. Everybody knows it, including the Democrats.
No, I don't think much of him. I think that he's a -- he's the twin of de Blasio, except shorter. Okay. Thank you everybody.
",Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to the Press Before Marine One Departure,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-marine-one-departure-june-2-2019
Barack Obama,United States of America,2012-09-12,"Good morning. Every day, all across the world, American diplomats and civilians work tirelessly to advance the interests and values of our nation. Often, they are away from their families. Sometimes, they brave great danger.
Yesterday, four of these extraordinary Americans were killed in an attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi. Among those killed was our Ambassador, Chris Stevens, as well as Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith. We are still notifying the families of the others who were killed. And today, the American people stand united in holding the families of the four Americans in our thoughts and in our prayers.
The United States condemns in the strongest terms this outrageous and shocking attack. We're working with the government of Libya to secure our diplomats. I've also directed my administration to increase our security at diplomatic posts around the world. And make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people.
Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification to this type of senseless violence. None. The world must stand together to unequivocally reject these brutal acts.
Already, many Libyans have joined us in doing so, and this attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya. Libyan security personnel fought back against the attackers alongside Americans. Libyans helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens’s body to the hospital, where we tragically learned that he had died.
It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi because it is a city that he helped to save. At the height of the Libyan revolution, Chris led our diplomatic post in Benghazi. With characteristic skill, courage, and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyan revolutionaries, and helped them as they planned to build a new Libya. When the Qaddafi regime came to an end, Chris was there to serve as our ambassador to the new Libya, and he worked tirelessly to support this young democracy, and I think both Secretary Clinton and I relied deeply on his knowledge of the situation on the ground there. He was a role model to all who worked with him and to the young diplomats who aspire to walk in his footsteps.
Along with his colleagues, Chris died in a country that is still striving to emerge from the recent experience of war. Today, the loss of these four Americans is fresh, but our memories of them linger on. I have no doubt that their legacy will live on through the work that they did far from our shores and in the hearts of those who love them back home.
Of course, yesterday was already a painful day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks. We mourned with the families who were lost on that day. I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery, and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. And then last night, we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi.
As Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it. Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe.
No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.
But we also know that the lives these Americans led stand in stark contrast to those of their attackers. These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. They should give every American great pride in the country that they served, and the hope that our flag represents to people around the globe who also yearn to live in freedom and with dignity.
We grieve with their families, but let us carry on their memory, and let us continue their work of seeking a stronger America and a better world for all of our children.
Thank you. May God bless the memory of those we lost and may God bless the United States of America.
",Rose Garden Address on Benghazi Attacks,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamabenghaziattacks.htm
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-05-08,"My fellow Americans: Today, I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror. It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al Qaeda.
Over the years, Iran and its proxies have bombed American embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American servicemembers, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens. The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people.
No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them. In 2015, the previous administration joined with other nations in a deal regarding Iran's nuclear program. This agreement was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.
In theory, the so-called Iran deal was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime. In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.
The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime's nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.
In other words, at the point when the United States had maximum leverage, this disastrous deal gave this regime -- and it's a regime of great terror -- many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash -- a great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.
A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it wasn't. At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.
Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Last week, Israel published intelligence documents long concealed by Iran, conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons. The fact is this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.
In the years since the deal was reached, Iran's military budget has grown by almost 40 percent, while its economy is doing very badly. After the sanctions were lifted, the dictatorship used its new funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism, and cause havoc throughout the Middle East and beyond.
The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time. The deal's sunset provisions are totally unacceptable. If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.
Making matters worse, the deal's inspection provisions lack adequate mechanisms to prevent, detect, and punish cheating, and don't even have the unqualified right to inspect many important locations, including military facilities.
Not only does the deal fail to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regime's development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads.
Finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iran's destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism. Since the agreement, Iran's bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen. In light of these glaring flaws, I announced last October that the Iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated.
Three months later, on January 12th, I repeated these conditions. I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement.
Over the past few months, we have engaged extensively with our allies and partners around the world, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We have also consulted with our friends from across the Middle East. We are unified in our understanding of the threat and in our conviction that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.
After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement. The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen.
In just a short period of time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons. Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.
America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. And we will not allow a regime that chants Death to America to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth.
Today's action sends a critical message: The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them. In fact, at this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un.
Plans are being made. Relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen and, with the help of China, South Korea, and Japan, a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone.
As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat. This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran's ballistic missile program; to stop its terrorist activities worldwide; and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East.
In the meantime, powerful sanctions will go into full effect. If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.
Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran: The people of America stand with you. It has now been almost 40 years since this dictatorship seized power and took a proud nation hostage. Most of Iran's 80 million citizens have sadly never known an Iran that prospered in peace with its neighbors and commanded the admiration of the world.
But the future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land. And they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history, and glory to God.
Iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal; they refuse. And that's fine. I'd probably say the same thing if I was in their position. But the fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. When they do, I am ready, willing, and able.
Great things can happen for Iran, and great things can happen for the peace and stability that we all want in the Middle East. There has been enough suffering, death, and destruction. Let it end now. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. This will make America much safer. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Secretary Pompeo is, right now, going to North Korea. He will be there very shortly in a matter of virtual -- probably an hour. He's got meetings set up. We have our meeting scheduled. We have our meeting set. The location is picked -- the time and the date. Everything is picked. And we look forward to having a very great success.
We think relationships are building with North Korea. We'll see how it all works out. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. But it can be a great thing for North Korea, South Korea, Japan and the entire world. We hope it all works out. Thank you very much.
We'll all soon be finding out. We will soon be finding out. It would be a great thing if they are. We'll soon be finding out. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Annouces His Iran Policy at The White House,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-iran-jcpoa-nuclear-deal-may-8-2018
Philip Hammond,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"class=""first-para"">I am delighted to make my maiden speech in the debate on this short but important Bill, which will have a significant effect on many of my constituents.
A number of my hon. Friends who are new Members have already made their maiden speeches. My tardiness owes something to Disraeli’s advice to a new Member: “It is better they wonder why you do not speak than that they wonder why you do.” It must be said that if I were looking for support from my colleagues, my timing has not been perfect; but Conservative Members are not so numerous that we can afford to carry passengers indefinitely and, for better or worse, the time has now come.
I have the privilege to represent the new constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge, which was formed largely from the former Chertsey and Walton constituency, with a piece of North-West Surrey attached to it. The boundary commission seldom wins friends when naming new constituencies, but that much-maligned body has surely got it right this time in including the historic name of Runnymede in the title of a constituency for the first time.
I am sure that many hon. Members envy me a constituency which stretches from the Wentworth golf course in the west to the St. George’s hill course in the east, by way of another five first-class courses. It is, perhaps, in the interest of diligent pursuit of parliamentary duties that such a constituency should return a non-golfing Member.
I follow in the footsteps of a number of eminent Members who have represented areas that are now part of my constituency, but it is my immediate predecessors in Chertsey and Walton and North-West Surrey to whom I now pay tribute. Both Sir Geoffrey Pattie and Sir Michael Grylls did excellent work on behalf of their constituents over the years, in their different ways. My special thanks are due to Sir Geoffrey Pattie for the superb apprenticeship that he bestowed on me during the 18 months before my election. He served Chertsey and Walton for 23 years, becoming a Minister and a vice-chairman of the Conservative party. I can honestly say that, if at the end of my parliamentary career I have made half as many friends and admirers in my constituency as Sir Geoffrey has, I shall regard that career as having been a great success.
Runnymede and Weybridge comprises two local authority areas, the borough of Runnymede itself and part of the borough of Elmbridge. The constituency straddles the M25 and the M3; indeed, in those road atlases that tend to exaggerate the width of roads my constituency appears to contain little other than the intersection of those two motorways. It also comprises the ancient town of Chertsey, where the Romans first crossed the River Thames, Egham, Addlestone and Weybridge, as well as the historic site of Runnymede and that of the Tudor royal palace of Oatlands. Those historic locations, together with a selection of smaller towns and villages and the garden estates of Wentworth and St. George’s Hill, are set in the beautiful Surrey countryside, which many people are surprised to find so close to London.
Most, if not all, hon. Members will recognise the name of my constituency and may even be able to locate it geographically through their knowledge of the events in 1215. The basis of constitutional government in England began to emerge when Magna Carta was signed in the meadows by the Thames, between Staines and Windsor, near the town of Egham. We can trace the origins of our modern freedoms to that event which took place in my constituency. It was on 15 June that year when the King and the barons first met at Runnymede. During the next few days, they negotiated the charter. I am delighted to be able to commemorate this week, the 782nd anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta, by making my maiden contribution in the House in the name of Runnymede and Weybridge.
Rather more recently, Brooklands, in Weybridge, has been renowned as the home of British motor sport and the birthplace of the British aviation industry. It spawned an engineering industry in the area, which provided an important part of the country’s aviation resource during the second world war. It has also created a surprisingly diverse economy in our constituency.
The Brooklands museum is an extraordinary tribute to the men of vision and spirit who built those twin industries on Hugh Locke-King’s race-track during the 1920s and 1930s. I strongly recommend hon. Members to take the time to visit that museum when passing through my constituency.
Like people in many similar areas of the home counties, my constituents enjoy the benefits of material prosperity, which are due primarily to our proximity to London and the excellent communications that we enjoy because of the motorway network and Heathrow airport. We also suffer because of that proximity from traffic, noise, pollution and the inexorable pressure for further development. The challenge for my constituency as we move into the new millennium will be to get the balance right. We must achieve the correct balance between continuing prosperity and maintaining the quality of life in the area. That will not be an easy task, but I look forward to playing my part, together with the elected local authorities in the constituency, in achieving it over the years to come.
It will be a pleasure to work with those local authorities, especially Surrey county council, now returned to Conservative control by a substantial majority, and Runnymede borough council, which is also Conservative controlled. Whatever other messages the electors of Surrey may have sent out on 1 May, they clearly voted yes to sound Conservative principles and good management in local government.
Runnymede has the lowest council tax in Surrey while, by general consensus, delivering a high standard of services. It has no statutory obligation to do so, but it is the highest spending authority on services for the elderly in Surrey. Its programme of upgrading and improving council-owned housing stock has the widespread support of tenants. Its private sector partnerships have attracted interest across the country. A key factor in achieving that enviable combination of low council tax and high service provision has been the careful management of its capital receipts. Runnymede is debt-free and it has chosen to invest its capital receipts to produce a substantial income to supplement the council tax for the benefit of all the people of Runnymede.
When the Labour party first promoted the idea of the release of capital receipts, it was presented as some kind of cost-free option. The idea was to take out from under the bed the pot of gold that the wicked Tories had squirrelled away and to spend it to good effect. It is now generally understood that there is no pot of gold. To the extent that set-aside capital receipts are cash-backed, the cash is largely in the wrong places. In public sector borrowing terms, the receipts have already been taken into account. Any increase in the aggregate supplementary credit approvals issued will result in an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. There is no offsetting effect on the PSBR from any notional release of set-aside capital receipts. There was no mention earlier of the Revenue effects of the increased housing provision that the Government are seeking. If the Government achieve anything by the Bill it will be only by robbing Peter to pay Paul.
The reference in the Bill to capital receipts is a smoke-screen. It does not detail the methodology that will apply in determining the supplementary credit applications. If it is to increase the amount of investment in social housing, it must envisage an increase in the aggregate amount of borrowing by local authorities for that purpose.
The Bill provides a thin cover, through the mechanism of taking total capital receipts into account when determining the supplementary credit approvals, for a transfer of borrowing power from authorities with capital receipts to those without. In many cases, that will mean a transfer of borrowing power from authorities that have managed their housing stock well; taken a forward-looking, innovative approach to housing; and undertaken large-scale voluntary transfers to those that have succeeded in frustrating their tenants’ right to buy and which have eschewed the opportunities of the large-scale voluntary transfers that have brought such a welcome diversity to the social housing sector. Incidentally, such transfers have also attracted £4 billion of private sector money, which otherwise would not have been available. The Bill represents the worst kind of subsidy—a subsidy from the efficient to the inefficient.
The implementation of the Bill represents an unjustifiable penalisation of thrifty, well-managed councils such as Runnymede and an erosion of the principle of local autonomy and accountability, which the Government purport to favour. It will also lead directly to the imposition of higher council taxes and higher rents as receipt-rich authorities are forced to run down their balances and forgo the considerable income that those balances currently generate. No less an organisation than Shelter, hardly a well-known supporter of the Conservative view of the world, has calculated that council house rents will rise by £6 a week if all the receipts are released. It is clear that council taxes will rise or services will be cut as prudent councils find that the dice are loaded against them and are forced to liquidate investments.
The Bill is an attack on thrift and good management. It represents a thinly veiled transfer of borrowing power to Labour’s friends in local government. I fear that my constituents may expect more of the same when the local government settlement is announced.
The Bill attacks the capital balances of prudent authorities and an attack on their revenue support will not be far behind. It is the new Government’s double whammy for the council tax payers of Surrey.
When the Bill is stripped of the smokescreen of capital receipts, it is clear that it paves the way for either an increase in the PSBR or for the reallocation of borrowing power away from receipt-rich authorities. It would be better if it said so plainly without hiding behind the fig leaf of capital receipts. It represents an inefficient way of achieving the Government’s legitimate manifesto commitment to higher investment in social housing.
The Bill is unfair in its effect on prudent local authorities. It is lacking in detail. It confers excessive discretion on Ministers. In short, it is an ill-conceived piece of legislation and I urge the House to vote against it on Second Reading.

Philip Hammond,United Kingdom,2016-04-22,"With permission, I shall update the House on the current situation in Libya and on what the Government are doing to support the new Libyan Government of National Accord.
Yesterday, I visited Tripoli; it was the first time that a British Foreign Secretary had done so since 2011. The fact that the visit was able to take place is a positive sign of the progress made in recent weeks, including in the security situation in and around the capital. During my visit, I met Prime Minister Sarraj and members of the Presidency Council in the naval base that has been the headquarters of the Government of national accord since they relocated to Tripoli on 30 March. I welcomed their commitment to representing all the Libyan people and the progress they have made in establishing the GNA as a Government of the whole of Libya.
I underlined to Prime Minister Sarraj the UK’s support for the GNA as the only legitimate Government of Libya. They have the endorsement of the Libyan political dialogue and the majority of members of the House of Representatives. I believe the Libyan people want them to succeed. We look forward to the House of Representatives completing its formal vote of endorsement in line with its obligations under the Libyan political agreement.
I was encouraged to hear from Prime Minister Sarraj and his Ministers about the steps they are taking to assume control of Government Ministries in Tripoli. After five years of conflict following the overthrow of Gaddafi, the Libyan people are weary of fighting and eager for peace. They want a Government who will start to address the many challenges Libya faces. It is important that the international community works in partnership with the GNA as they continue to consolidate their position and take forward their work to meet the needs of Libyan citizens across the country.
In my meetings, I emphasised the need to keep up momentum on the political process and to deliver practical progress on the ground. I was encouraged to hear that a clear plan was being developed to address some of the immediate challenges: delivering security, tackling Daesh, restoring basic public services, countering people-trafficking, restarting oil production, and getting the economy back on track.
We agreed that delivering security was fundamental to improving the day-to-day lives of the Libyan people and creating an environment for economic reactivation. The security agenda must, of course, be owned and led by the GNA, but the UK, along with other European nations, stands ready to respond to requests from the Libyan Government for assistance in training the Libyan armed forces in order to improve their effectiveness in providing security and in the fight against Daesh. Prime Minister Sarraj and I agreed that we should continue to work closely to establish what those training and technical support requirements were, and what role, if any, the international community could play in helping to meet them.
A number of Members have speculated in recent days that the Government might be on the cusp of committing British troops to Libya in a combat, or combat support, role. I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify the situation. I am clear about the fact that there is no appetite in Libya for foreign combat troops on the ground. We do not anticipate any requests from the GNA for ground combat forces to take on Daesh or any other armed groups, and we have no plans to deploy troops in such a role. I will, of course, keep the House informed of any plans that we develop in the future in response to requests from the Libyan Government, but the type of mission that we currently envisage would be focused on providing training and technical support, away from any front-line operations.
The Libyan economy is suffering from the effects of years of conflict and the impact of low oil prices. It is clear that the Presidency Council is focused on the immediate need to alleviate the pressures on ordinary Libyans, including those arising from the current squeeze on liquidity in the banking system, the shortfall in power generation and the shortage of basic commodities, as well as the slightly longer-term challenge of ensuring the effective functioning of the key state financial institutions—the Central Bank of Libya, the National Oil Corporation and the Libyan Investment Authority—and the challenge of rebuilding oil production and export capacity. As I said to Prime Minister Sarraj, the UK stands ready to provide whatever technical assistance it can with those issues, in all of which British companies have relevant experience and expertise to share.
As for the migration threat, there is clearly an urgent need to tackle the challenges arising from irregular migration and the organised criminal and terrorist networks that facilitate so much of it. In my discussions, I highlighted our desire to work in close partnership with the GNA to make progress on that issue, including progress in tackling the people-smugglers and traffickers. As part of that initiative, we should look at creating a package of support that could include extending the EU’s naval Operation Sophia and building the capacity of the Libyan coastguard to support, and eventually take over, the operation, but clearly such a package would be implemented only at the invitation of the Libyan Government.
Yesterday I announced that Britain would allocate £10 million for technical support to the GNA in this financial year, to be delivered through the conflict, security and stability fund. The package will support the strengthening of political participation, economic development, and the delivery of capacity in security, justice and defence. We will work closely with the GNA to ensure that that support is channelled into the areas where it can have the greatest effect.
After years of conflict in Libya, the formation of the Government of national accord and their arrival in Tripoli have the potential to mark a real turning point in Libya’s fortunes. The challenges facing the GNA should not be underestimated, and delivering the security and economic development that will allow the Libyan people to realise their country’s huge potential will not be an easy task to fulfil, but the UK, together with many of our international partners, stands ready to assist. It is in all our interests that Prime Minister Sarraj and his Government are able to re-establish security, reactivate the economy, and defeat Daesh in Libya as quickly as possible. I commend this statement to the House.
",2016 Statement on Libya,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/philip-hammond-2016-statement-on-libya/
George W. Bush,United States of America,2008-01-28 00:00:00,"Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:
Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say, we've answered the call. Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose, and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government.
All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep.
The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time.
From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done.
In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures.
To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future.
In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. So last week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working, and this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.
We have other work to do on taxes. Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we've delivered over the past seven years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm. I'm pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders.
Most Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the tax relief permanent. And members of Congress should know, if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it.
Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I'll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets; so should their government.
The people's trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto.
And tomorrow I will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.
Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. And Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow state housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.
To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control. So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year.
The Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office, not in the halls of Congress.
On education, we must trust students to learn, if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams, and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them.
Six years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today, no one can deny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading scores are on the rise. African-American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibilities for states and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools.
Members of Congress, the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding. And we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law.
We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our nation's capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other non-public school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. Together we've expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.
On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world. So we're working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We're working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements.
I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea. Many products from these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world, those whose products say ""Made in the USA.""
These agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.
Trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government has a responsibility to help. I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.
To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil.
Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together we should take the next steps. Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases.
This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology.
To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask Congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth.
On matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life.
So we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices, such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.
On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says. I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote.
In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over the past seven years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have volunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the federal government. And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend charitable choice.
Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the gulf coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April, we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans.
There are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. Every member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I've laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren.
The other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure our borders, and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. We're increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We've effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm.
We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals.
This is the business of our nation here at home. Yet building a prosperous future for our citizen also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.
Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last seven years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections. We've seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. We've seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new Parliament. We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have inspired us.
In the past seven years, we've also seen the images that have sobered us. We've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand. We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists, evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule.
Since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. We will stay on the offense; we will keep up the pressure; and we will deliver justice to our enemies.
We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom.
In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country. Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaeda is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan.
In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. We gave our troops a new mission: Work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people; pursue the enemy in its strongholds; and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.
The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole nation.
The Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaeda's brutality, started a popular uprising called the ""Anbar Awakening."" Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country. And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. The government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well, adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year.
While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago. When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down.
When we met last year, militia extremists -- some armed and trained by Iran -- were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country.
When we met last year, Al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is Al Qaeda that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held. And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaeda leaders and operatives.
Last month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated.
When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of return on success, and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home.
This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines. Soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've asked of you and more. Our nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our nation. And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.
Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home.
Any further drawdown of U. S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in, quote, ""the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, Al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase in violence."" Members of Congress, having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.
In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shi'a, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. We're seeing some encouraging signs. The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. The Parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Ba'athification reform. They're now debating a provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel, but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future.
The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. But it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny Al Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.
By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its intentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaeda's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington. My fellow Americans, we will not rest either. We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America.
We're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel. Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peace.
We're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran. Iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hizballah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon.
Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you. We respect your traditions and your history. We look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops; we will stand by our allies; and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.
On the homefront, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11. This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. In the past six years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks.
And we owe them something more; we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they're planning. Last year, Congress passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately, Congress set the legislations to expire on February 1. That means if you don't act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America. We've had ample time for debate. The time to act is now.
Protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interests; it is the calling of our conscience.
America opposes genocide in Sudan. We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.
America is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.
America is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half the world's food aid comes from the United States. And tonight I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine.
America is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we're working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next five years.
America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past seven years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. And as we increase funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. I call on Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity.
Our military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children. Our military families serve our nation; they inspire our nation; and tonight our nation honors them.
The strength -- the secret of our strength, the miracle of America is that our greatness lies not in our government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When the federal convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, ""We the undersigned delegates."" When Governor Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our nation and the history of the world: ""We the people.""
By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue to trust the people, our nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union will remain strong.
So tonight, with confidence in freedom's power and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. God bless America.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-01-16,"Well, it's similar. We have great love for both countries. These are great countries, great places. It's very interesting how the UK broke away. I sort of, as you know, predicted it. I was in Turnberry and was doing a ribbon cutting because I bought Turnberry, which is doing unbelievably, and I'll tell you, the fact that your pound sterling has gone down? Great. Because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK, as you know. I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing.
Absolutely, very quickly. I'm a big fan of the UK, uh, we're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly -- good for both sides.
She's requesting a meeting and we'll have a meeting right after I get into the White House and it'll be, I think we're gonna get something done very quickly.
People don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country and you know in this country we're gonna go very strong borders from the day I get in. One of the first orders I'm gonna sign Ð day one Ð which I will consider to be Monday as opposed to Friday or Saturday. Right? I mean my day one is gonna be Monday because I don't want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration, but one of the first orders we're gonna be signing is gonna be strong borders.
We don't want people coming in from Syria who we don't know who they are. You know there's no way of vetting these people. I don't want to do what Germany did.
And I've great respect for Merkel, by the way, I have to say. I have great respect for her. But, I, I think it was, I think it was very unfortunate what happened.
And you know I have a love for Germany because my father came from Germany and, I don't want to be in that position. You know the way I look at it, we have enough problems.
Well, from various parts of the world that have lots of terrorism problems.
There will be extreme vetting, it's not gonna be like it is now, they don't even, we don't even have real vetting. The vetting into this country is essentially non-existent as it is, as it was at least, with your country.
Well, it could happen, I mean we're gonna have to see. I mean, we're looking at parts of Europe; parts of the world and parts of Europe, where we have problems where they come in and they're gonna be causing problems. I don't wanna have those problems. Look, I won the election because of strong borders and trade. And military, we're gonna have strong military.
Well, it's great. I mean, I'm very proud of Germany and Germany is very special Bad DŸrkheim, right? This is serious Germany, right? Like this isn't any question -- this is serious Germany. No, I'm very proud of Germany. I love Germany, I love the UK.
Yes, I have been to Germany.
Well, I don't know who she's running against, number one, I'm just saying, I don't know her, I've never met her. As I said, I've had great respect for her. I felt she was a great, great leader. I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from. You'll find out, you got a big dose of it a week ago. So I think she made a catastrophic mistake, very bad mistake. Now, with that being said, I respect her, I like her, but I don't know her. So I can't talk about who I'm gonna be backing -- if anyone.
I look forward to doing it. My mother was very ceremonial, I think that's where I got this aspect because my father was very brick-and-mortar, he was like, and my mother sort of had a flair, she loved the Queen, she loved anything -- she was so proud of the Queen. She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, cause nobody does that like the English. And she had great respect for the Queen, liked her. Anytime the Queen was on television, an event, my mother would be watching. Crazy, right?
Well, the Scottish are known for watching their pennies, so I like to watch my pennies -- I mean I deal in big pennies, that's the problem.
I like order. I like things done in an orderly manner. And certainly the Germans, that's something that they're rather well known for. But I do, I like order and I like strength.
I think it's not good. I think it was a big mistake for Germany. And Germany of all countries, 'cause Germany was one of the toughest in the world for having anybody go in, and, uh, no I think it was a mistake. And I'll see her and I'll meet her and I respect her. And I like her but I think it was a mistake. And people make mistakes but I think it was a very big mistake. I think we should have built safe zones in Syria. Would have been a lot less expensive. Uh, get the Gulf states to pay for 'em who aren't coming through, I mean they've got money that nobody has.
Would have been a lot less expensive than the trauma that Germany's going through now -- but I would have said -- you build safe zones in Syria. Look, this whole thing should have never happened. Iraq should not have been attacked in the first place, all right? It was one of the worst decisions, possibly the worst decision ever made in the history of our country. We've unleashed -- it's like throwing rocks into a beehive. It's one of the great messes of all time. I looked at something, uh, I'm not allowed to show you because it's classified Ð but, I just looked at Afghanistan and you look at the Taliban Ð and you take a look at every, every year its more, more, more, you know they have the different colours Ð and you say, you know Ð what's going on?
Afghanistan is, is not going well. Nothing's going well -- I guess we've been in Afghanistan almost 17 years -- but you look at all of the places, now in all fairness, we haven't let our people do what they're supposed to do. You know we have great military, we're gonna have much greater military because we're gonna have -- you know right now it's very depleted, we're gonna have great military, but we haven't let our military win.
Boeing and Lockheed Martin are you know big contractors for this country and we have an F-35 program that has been very, very severely over budget and behind schedule. Hundreds of billions of dollars over budget and seven years behind schedule. And, uh, they got to shape up.
Isis.
Well, I'd rather not say, I don't want to be like Obama or others where they say -- I always talk about Mosul, you know Mosul's turned out to be a disas -- brutal. So Mosul, so they announced four months ago we're going to attack Mosul -- I said, ""Why do you have to announce it?"". Like you said, ""What's going to be your priority?"". When are you going to attack? When are you gonna, how are you gonna do it? What kind of weapons are you gonna use, right? What time of the day?
Mosul turned out to be a disaster because we announced five months ago that we were going into Mosul, in five months. In four months we said, ""We're getting ready"", by the time we get in, it's been so much talk -- and it's been very hard to take -- you know that, right?
Nah, I think it's a very rough thing. It's a very bad thing, we had a chance to do something when we had the line in the sand and it wasn't -- nothing happened. That was the only time -- and now, it's sort of very late. It's too late. Now everything is over -- at some point it will come to an end -- but Aleppo was nasty. I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town -- they can't even walk and they're shooting 'em -- it almost looks like they're shooting 'em for sport -- ah no, that's a terrible -- that's been a terrible situation. Aleppo has been such a terrible humanitarian situation.
Well, I start off trusting both -- but let's see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.
Sure. Oh sure, I know that. I mean, I understand what's going on, I said a long time ago -- that Nato had problems. Number one it was obsolete, because it was, you know, designed many, many years ago. Number two -- the countries aren't paying what they're supposed to pay. I took such heat, when I said Nato was obsolete. It's obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right -- and now -- it was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, they have a whole division devoted now to terror, which is good.
And the other thing is the countries aren't paying their fair share so we're supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, Nato is very important to me.
Britain is paying. There's five countries that are paying what they're supposed to. Five. It's not much, from 22.
Yeah, I feel very strongly toward Europe -- very strongly toward Europe, yes.
Well, I think you know -- people have to get together and people have to do what they have to do in terms of being fair. OK? They have sanctions on Russia -- let's see if we can make some good deals with Russia. For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that's part of it. But you do have sanctions and Russia's hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit.
Well, I don't want to say what I'm gonna do with the Iran deal. I just don't want to play the cards. I mean, look, I'm not a politician, I don't go out and say, 'I'm gonna do this -- I'm gonna do --', I gotta do what I gotta do. But I don't wanna play. Who plays cards where you show everybody the hand before you play it? But I'm not happy with the Iran deal, I think it's one of the worst deals ever made, I think it's one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen, one of the dumbest, in terms of a deal. Where you give -- where you give a $150 billion back to a country, where you give $1.7 billion in cash -- did you ever see a million dollars in hundred dollar bills? It's a lot. It's a whole -- it's a lot. $1.7 billion in cash. Plane loads. Of, of -- think of it -- plane, many planes. Boom. $1.7 billion. I don't understand. It just shows the power of a president -- when a president of this country can authorise $1.7 billion in cash, that's a lot of power.
No, I think that money is in Swiss bank accounts -- they don't need that money, they're using other money, I think they've taken that money and they've kept it for themselves. That's my opinion.
I think it was terrible. It should have been a veto. I think it was terrible.
Well, the UK may have another chance to veto if what I'm hearing is true, because you know you have a meeting as you know, this weekend. And there are a lot of bad stories being circulated. The problem I have is that it makes it a tougher deal for me to negotiate because the Palestinians are given so much -- even though it's not legally binding it's psychologically binding and it makes it much tougher for me to negotiate. You understand that? Because people are giving away chips, they're giving away all these chips.
Well, I'd like to see the UK veto. I think it'd be great if they veto because I'm not sure the United States is gonna veto, amazingly. They won't, right? You think the United States is gonna veto? I'll have friends who are Jewish have a fundraiser for Obama and I'll say, ""What are you doing? OK -- what are you doing?""
Well, I don't want to comment on that, again, but we'll see what happens.
Yeah, well I would say Merkel is by far one of the most important leaders. 'Cause you look at the UK and you look at the European Union and it's Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out and you were there and you guys wrote it -- put it on the front page: ""Trump said that Brexit is gonna happen"". That was when it was gonna lose easily, you know, everybody thought I was crazy. Obama said to go to the back of the line. Meaning, if it does happen -- and then he had to retract -- that was a bad statement to make.
I think you're doing great. I think it's going great.
I think it's tough. I spoke to the head of the European Union, very fine gentleman called me up.
Yes, ah, to congratulate me on what happened with respect to the election. Uh, I think it's very tough. I think it's tough. People, countries want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity but, I do believe this, if they hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it, you know, entails, I think that you wouldn't have a Brexit. It probably could have worked out but, this was the final straw, this was the final straw that broke the camel's back.
I think people want, people want their own identity, so if you ask me, others, I believe others will leave.
Well, it's doing OK. I mean, you know. What do you trust? I trust the dollar, I'm gonna trust the dollar a lot more in four years than I do now, but sure I mean it's a currency, it's fine. But I do think keeping it together is not gonna be as easy as a lot of people think. And I think this, if refugees keep pouring into different part of Europe. I think it's gonna be very hard to keep it together cause people are angry about it.
Personally, I don't think it matters much for the United States. I never thought it mattered. Look, the EU was formed, partially, to beat the United States on trade, OK? So, I don't really care whether it's separate or together, to me it doesn't matter. I can see this -- I own a big property in Ireland, magnificent property called Doonbeg, what happened is I went for an approval to do this massive, beautiful expansion -- that was when I was a developer, now I couldn't care less about it -- but I learnt a lot because I got the approvals very quickly from Ireland and then Ireland and my people went to the EU to get the approval -- it was going to take years -- that was a very bad thing for Ireland.
Well I can tell you from the environmental standpoint, they were using environmental tricks to stop a project from being built -- I found it to be a very unpleasant experience. To get the approvals from the EU would have taken years -- I don't think that's good for a country like Ireland so you know what I did? I said forget it I'm not gonna build it.
Well, I can tell you that in the last É I think I've done more than any president-elect ever -- Many factories now, many car plants, that were going to be built in other locations are building in Michigan and Ohio -- ya know Ford announced a big one, Fiat Chrysler announced a big one, General Motors is announcing, they're all announcing and I'm not just talking about cars I'm talking about other things, there will be many other things -- you can't allow companies to leave our country, fire all of its employees, move to Mexico, make whatever the product is, and then sell it back in with no tax -- and there will be a very substantial border tax for companies that do that. And when people hear that -- they say we're gonna stay here or we're gonna build in the US -- so they'll go and they'll build their car plant or they'll build their air-conditioning plant and they're gonna sell their air conditioners but they're gonna pay 35 per cent tax... there's not gonna be any tax because they're not gonna leave -- see there's not gonna be any tax -- but the conservative theory is open borders, open borders is all fine. First of all it's bad for security -- for trade it's fine -- the problem is the US is always taken advantage of -- we have hundreds of billions of dollars of trade deficits with China -- we have $805 billion in trade deficits with the world -- ya almost say, who's making these deals when you're losing that kind of money, right -- we actually have almost $800 billion -- almost $800 billion in trade deficits with the world -- so you say, who's making these deals?
Well you're very good at export -- we buy lots of your cars.
It's going to be different -- I mean Germany is a great country, great manufacturing country -- you go down Fifth Avenue everybody has a Mercedes-Benz in front of their building, right -- the fact is that it's been very unfair to the US, it's not a two-way street. How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany. . .
And I will say most of it... most of it is China 'cause China is a tremendous problem.
I would tell them, don't waste their time and money -- unless they want to sell to other countries, that's fine -- if they want to open in Mexico, I love Mexico, I like the president, I like everybody -- but I would tell BMW if they think they're gonna build a plant in Mexico and sell cars into the US without a 35 per cent tax, it's not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen -- so if they want to build cars for the world I would say wish them luck -- they can build cars for the US but they'll be paying a 35 per cent tax on every car that comes into the country... so what I'm saying is they have to build their plant in the US, it will be much better for them and what we're doing -- maybe more importantly, is we're lowering taxes -- corporate taxes -- down to from 15 to 20 per cent and were getting rid of 75 per cent of the regulations -- from 35 down to 15 to 20, we haven't picked the final but from 15 to 20, and we're also gonna let the companies bring back their money with the inversion, corporate inversion.
Well, we've got five -- I think it's five, they say it's 2.5-3, I think it's five, but it's $5 trillion over there and they can't bring back their money so that's part of our tax bill, the money comes back.
I'm pragmatic, look I go in front of crowds -- I had the biggest crowds anybody's ever had for a presidential election and that's tough and when I was fighting with Jeb Bush, ya know ""low energy"" Jeb, he would say, 'Donald Trump is not a conservative', so I'd go in front of 25,000 people and, like in Michigan, where there's massive -- 32,000 people -- and I'm screaming, 'Jeb Bush says I'm not a conservative', they're screaming, 'Who cares?', and I said, 'What do you want? Do you want conservative or a good deal?' And the reason, because Jeb Bush said I'm not a conservative because I don't believe in free trade -- well I do believe in free trade, I love free trade, but it's gotta be smart trade so I call it fair trade -- and the problem, so I said to the people, 'Do you want a conservative or do you want somebody who's gonna make great deals?', and they're all screaming, 'Great deals, great deals' -- they don't care, there are no labels -- ya know there's some people, he is not -- Jeb Bush would stand up -- 'He is not a true conservative' -- who cares -- I am a conservative, but I'm really about making great deals for the people so they get jobs... the people don't care ya know when you're talking -- they don't care, they want good deals -- ya know what? They want their jobs back.
Well, I don't like heroes, I don't like the concept of heroes, the concept of heroes is never great, but certainly you can respect certain people and certainly there are certain people -- but I've learnt a lot from my father -- my father was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens -- he did houses and housing and I learnt a lot about negotiation from my father -- although I also think negotiation is a natural trait, I don't think you can, you either have it or you don't, you get better at it but basically, the people that I know who are great negotiators or great salesmen or great politicians, it's very natural, very natural... I got a letter from somebody, their congressman, they said what you've done is amazing because you were never a politician and you beat all the politicians. He said they added it up -- when I was three months into the campaign, they added it up -- I had three months of experience and the 17 guys I was running against, the Republicans, had 236 years Ð ya know when you add 20 years and 30 years -- so I was three months they were 236 years -- so it's sort of a funny article but I believe it's like hitting a baseball or being a good golfer -- natural ability, to me, is much more important to me than experience and experience is a great thing -- I think it's a great thing -- but I learnt a lot from my father in terms of leadership.
I don't want it to be a disruption -- I love the world, I want the world to be good but we can't go -- I mean look at what's happening to our country -- we are $20 trillion -- we don't know what we're doing -- our military is weak -- we're in wars that never end, we're in Afghanistan now 17 years, they told me this, really -- 17 years, it's the longest war we've ever been in.
Well, we have to have, ya have to have the right people and as you know Pompeo -- who's really been received, did a good job yesterday, head of the CIA -- might I think we have some very great people going in -- I think we have some great people -- ya know I have a lot of respect for the intelligence but a lot of leaks, a lot of fake news coming out, a lot of fake news.
Well, that guy is somebody that you should look at, because whatever he made up about me it was false -- he was supposedly hired by the Republicans and Democrats working together -- even that I don't believe because they don't work together, they work separately -- and they don't hire the same guy -- what they got together? See the whole thing is fake news because it said the, whoever it was, intelligence, the so-called intelligence, said he's an operative of Republicans and Democrats -- they don't work together, they don't work together.
I think probably could be intelligence or it could be, it could be, the Democrats.
When I just heard it -- I ripped up the mat... if I did that in a hotel it'd be the biggest thing -- they'd have me on the front page of The New York Post, right? And the other thing, I can't even, I don't even want to shake hands with people now I hear about this stuff -- ugh.
It's fake news, it was totally made up and I just got a letter from people that went to Russia with me -- did you see that letter -- very rich people, they went with me, they said you were with us, I was with them, I wasn't even here when they said such false stuff.
I left, I wasn't even there... I was there for the Miss Universe contest, got up, got my stuff and I left -- I wasn't even there -- it's all... so if this guy is a British guy you got a lot of problems.
Ya know this is a very, very big change -- I led a very nice life and ya know successful and good and nice and this is a lot different -- but ya know my attitude on that is when you're president, you're in the White House which is a very special place -- you're there for a limited period of time -- who wants to leave? Like I've liked President Obama, he's been very nice, yeah he's been nice one on one, but maybe not so nice in other ways -- but who wants to leave the White House to go to some other place and be away on a vacation? The White House is very special, there's so much work to be done, I'm not gonna be leaving much -- I mean a lot of work to be done -- I'm gonna be in there working, doing what I'm supposed to be doing -- but who wants to leave the White House?
Yea, Camp David is very rustic, it's nice, you'd like it. You know how long you'd like it? For about 30 minutesÉ
@realDonaldTrump I think, I'll keep it... so I've got 46 million people right now -- that's a lot, that's really a lot -- but 46 million -- including Facebook, Twitter and ya know, Instagram so when you think that your 46 million there, I'd rather just let that build up and just keep it @realDonaldTrump, it's working -- and the tweeting, I thought I'd do less of it, but I'm covered so dishonestly by the press -- so dishonestly -- that I can put out Twitter -- and it's not 140, it's now 140, 280 -- I can go bing bing bing and I just keep going and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out -- this morning on television, Fox -- ""Donald Trump, we have breaking news"" -- I put out a thing . . .
I tweeted a little bit, yeah.
I tweeted about the intelligence agencies because it all turned out to be false information.
This -- I have numerous, I have numerous -- I have iPhones, I have . . .
No, I do -- I have one or two people that do during the day I'll just dictate something and they'll type it in.
No, not Steve, but I have people that do it. But ya know the tweeting is interesting because I find it very accurate -- when I get a word out and if I tell something to the papers and they don't write it accurately, it's really bad -- they can't do much when you tweet it and I'm careful about, it's very precise, actually it's very, very precise -- and it comes out breaking news, we have breaking news -- ya know, it's funny, if I did a press release and if I put it out, it wouldn't get nearly -- people would see it the following day -- if I do a news conference, that's a lot of work.
Although the media have been better lately, which is shocking, shocking -- in fact today they have a front-page story saying that Trump's people will never leave him -- ya know all of the voters that I have will never leave -- which is very interesting cause we have great support in the country, tremendous support, I was very surprised at that story.
Oh, really... Ya know what, Jared is such a good kid and he'll make a deal with Israel that no one else can -- ya know he's a natural, he's a great deal, he's a natural -- ya know what I was talking about, natural -- he's a natural deal-maker -- everyone likes him.
Well, not now, she's going to Washington, and they're buying a house or something, but ya know she's got the children, so Jared will be involved as we announced -- no salary, no nothing. If he made peace -- who'd be better at that then Jared, right -- there's something about him . . .
Well, I'll be there -- we'll be there soon -- I would say we'll be here for a little while but and it looks like she'll be here first -- how is she doing over there, by the way, what do you think?
Yeah, May.
Popular. How are they doing with the break-up? How's the break-up going?
Well, we're gonna get a trade deal. Well, how is our Nigel doing? I like him, I think he's a great guy, I think he's a very good guy and he was very supportive. He'd go around the US -- he was saying Trump's gonna win. He was one of the earliest people that said Trump was gonna win. So, he's gotta feel for it. Michael, you should've written that we were gonna win.
Good, I'd love that. That's fantastic -- how to fight terrorism, I can use that.
",Times of London and Bild: Interview with Donald Trump,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-new-york-ny-january-16-2017
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-10-20,"Thank you Al. Wow. That was good. Mm.
This is a helluva dinner. Well I want to thank Your Eminence. This is really great to be with you again. Beloved Governor Cuomo, our great senators.
Hi Chuck. He used to love me when I was a Democrat you know. Wherever you are.
Where's Mayor de Blasio. And I want to thank Al and Ann Smith, just a fantastic job you do with the dinner. Congratulations on a record - over $6 million, right? He's got a record.
It's true. The politicians. They've had me to their homes, they've introduced me to their children, I've become their best friends in many instances. They've asked for my endorsement and they always wanted my money.
And even called me really a dear, dear friend. But then suddenly, decided when I ran for president as a Republican, that I've always been a no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel. And they totally forgot about me. But that's OK.
You know, they say when you do this kind of an event you always start out with a self-deprecating joke. Some people think this would be tough for me, but the truth is ... Very modest.
It's true. In fact many people tell me that modesty is perhaps my best quality.
For instance, we both run impressive properties on Fifth Avenue. Of course his is much more impressive than mine. That's because I built mine with my own beautifully formed hands.
Is that correct? Nobody. Right. No contest. It's great to be here with a thousand wonderful people, or, as I call it, a small intimate dinner with some friends.
Or as Hillary calls it, her largest crowd of the season. This is corny stuff. I do recognize that I come into this event with a little bit of an advantage.
I know that so many of you in the archdiocese already have a place in your heart for a guy who started out as a carpenter working for his father. I was a carpenter working for mine. Not for a long period of time but I was.
For about three weeks. What's great about the Al Smith Dinner is that even in the rough and tumble world of a really, really hard-fought campaign - in fact I don't know if you know Hillary but last night they said, That was the most vicious debate in the history of politics And I don't know - are we supposed to be proud of that or where are we supposed to be on that one. But they did say that and I'm trying to think back to Lincoln. I don't think we can compete with that.
But the candidates have some light-hearted moments together, which is true. I have no doubt that Hillary is going to laugh quite a bit tonight, sometimes even at appropriate moments. In fact, just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, Pardon me.
And Hillary was very gracious. She said if somehow she gets elected she wants me to be, without question, either her ambassador to Iraq or to Afghanistan. It's my choice. Laughter] It's true. It's true. You know, last night, I called Hillary a nasty woman In fact, I'm actually starting to like Rosie a lot.
I know Hillary met my campaign manager, and I got the chance to meet the people who are working so hard to get her elected. There they are -- the heads of NBC, CNN, CBS, ABC -- there's the New York Times, right over there, and the Washington Post. True.
True. You know, the president told me to stop whining, but I really have to say, the media is even more biased this year than ever before -- ever.
You want the proof? Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it -- it's fantastic. They think she's absolutely great.
I don't know why. Stand up, Melania. Come on.
She took a lot of abuse. I'm -- she didn't know about that one. Am I okay? Is it okay? Cardinal, please speak to her. Laughter] I'd like to address an important religious matter: the issue of going to confession. Or, as Hillary calls it, the Fourth of July weekend with FBI Director Comey. Booing] How corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate Commission? Pretty corrupt. Hillary is, and has been, in politics since the 70s. What's her pitch? The economy is busted? The government's corrupt? Washington is failing? Vote for me. I've been working on these problems for 30 years.
I can fix it"" I wasn't really sure if Hillary was going to be here tonight, because I guess you didn't send her invitation by email. Or, maybe, you did and she just found out about it through the wonder of WikiLeaks. For example, Hillary believes that it.
That's okay. I don't know who they're angry at Hillary, you or I. For example, here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics. Now some of you haven't noticed, Hillary isn't laughing as much as the rest of us.
That's because she knows the jokes. And all of the jokes were given to her in advance of the dinner by Donna Brazile. Which is - everyone knows, of course, Hillary's belief that it takes a village, which only makes sense after all in places like Haiti, where she's taken a number of them.
I don't know - and I don't want this evening without saying something nice about my opponent. Hillary has been in Washington a long time. She knows a lot about how government works. And according to her sworn testimony Hillary has forgotten more things than most of us will ever, ever, ever know.
That I can tell you. On a personal note, what an amazing honor it is to be with all of you. And I want to congratulate Hillary on getting the nomination and we're in there fighting and over the next 19 days somebody's going to be chosen.
We'll see what happens. But I have great memories of coming to this dinner with my father over the years when I was a young man. Great experience for me. This was always a special experience for him and me to be together.
One thing we can all agree on is the need to support the great work that comes out of the dinner. Millions of dollars have been raised to support disadvantaged children, and I applaud the many people who have worked to make this wonderful event a critical lifeline for children in need. More than $6 million net, net, net, net.
The cardinal told me that's net net, Donald, remember. We can also agree on the need to stand up to anti-Catholic bias, to defend religious liberty and to create a culture that celebrates life. America is in many ways divided ...
America is in many ways divided like it's never been before. And the great religious leaders here tonight give us all an example that we can follow. We're living in a time, an age that we never thought possible before. The vicious barbarism we read about in history books, but never thought we'd see it in our so-called modern- day world.
Who would have thought we would be witnessing what we're witnessing today. We've got to be very strong, very, very smart, and we've got to come together not only as a nation, but as a world community. Thank you very much, God bless you and God bless America. Thank you. Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
Wow, it's a lot of people. Wow. Thank you very much, everybody. I love North Carolina.
We're going to have a big victory in North Carolina. In 56 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win back The White House. Believe me. And by the way, we have thousands of people outside trying to get in.
Would anybody like to give up their place? Anybody? No. No. Thank you all very much. It's a great honor.
To win back The White House, however, you must get out and vote. And remember that this means early voting, which begins on October 20th. So you have to go out, vote, on the 8th. Or early vote starting from October 20th.
This is our chance, in my opinion, it's our last chance. I really believe that. It's our last chance to take it back, to fix our rigged system, and to create prosperity for each and every American. True.
It's our last chance, folks, this is it. And after that, we have a whole new different country. And you are not going to like it very much. Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.
Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas. True. By contrast, I have been going around the country offering very detailed plans for reform and change. All of these reform plans are available on our website, and they are extensive.
But we have no choice, we have no choice. While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. True.
Your mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders, you are lawyers, you are very rich people in some cases. You are at the top of your class, you are at the top of your university, you are professors, you are everybody. You are everybody. You're Democrats, you're Independents, you're Republicans.
Above all else, you are Americans and you're entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you, and totally defends you and that is what you're going to get if you vote for Donald Trump. Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country. Every American. Whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.
That, I can promise. Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors, and special interests. She talks change but why hasn't she given it in 35 years? For 35 years she's been here, why hasn't she given change, she never will in a million years. He won't do it. Booing] I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute. But first, let me invite on to the stage some of our wonderful supporters who can tell you themselves what they think of her very horrible statements that she made three days ago. Folks, come on up.
That, I can tell you. Come on over.
","Speech: Donald Trump in New York, NY",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-new-york-ny-october-20-2016
Jeremy Hunt,United Kingdom,2019-01-23,"Ambassador, distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, I’m incredibly honoured to be here today as we remember those 6 million.
Seventy-four years ago, almost to the day, Soviet soldiers advanced into Poland and liberated Auschwitz. There, amid heaps of corpses, they discovered about 7,000 men, women and children, emaciated, starving, stricken by disease. These broken human beings were among the handful of survivors of the 1.3 million people who had passed through the gates of Auschwitz.
One of them, of course, was Primo Levi, who was found by Russian soldiers lying incapacitated with scarlet fever, indelibly tattooed with an identity number that he would bear for the rest of his life: ‘174517’. In his classic, If This Is a Man, he struggled to describe the essence of the crime wrought by the Holocaust. He said:
Language lacks words to express this offence, the demolition of a man.
In a moment, with almost prophetic intuition, the reality was revealed to us: we had reached the bottom. It is not possible to sink lower than this; no human condition is more miserable than this, nor could it conceivably be so.
Nothing belongs to us any more: they have taken away our clothes, our shoes, even our hair. If we speak, they will not listen, and if they listen, they will not understand. They have even take away our name, and if we want to keep it, we will have to find in ourselves the strength to do so, to manage somehow so that behind the name, something of us – of us as we were – still remains.
Primo Levi and other remarkable people summoned enough strength to preserve their dignity in defiance of relentless efforts to extinguish the last embers of their humanity.
In 2006, I had the life-changing experience of visiting Auschwitz myself with Holocaust Education Trust. The trip was led by the inspirational Rabbi Barry Marcus, who many of you will know.
Before going into the concentration camp, we visited a museum to commemorate the Poles who had sheltered Jews. The penalty, of course, was death, not just for the individual, but for every member of that individual’s family. More than 5,000 Poles took that risk. Many others across Europe looked away. What would each of us do if history repeated itself?
I’ll never forget standing on that railway platform where so many human beings’ fate was decided by a simple instruction to turn left or right.
I’ll never forget Rabbi Marcus singing in Hebrew as we reflected on the horror of what was around us. Nor will I forget the remarkable Polish guard who never once referred to Jews being killed: she always used the word ‘murdered’.
And a question that troubled me as I tried to take all this in is, would I have looked away? Would I have done the right thing? With 3 young children that I have now whose lives are just beginning, what would I have done?
So today as Foreign Secretary, it is an incredible privilege to honour some of those who did not look away, and who worked for the Foreign Office, or our sister organisation, the Secret Intelligence Service.
One of them was Captain Frank Foley, whose bust we shall shortly be unveiling. Frank Foley fought in the trenches during World War One before being recruited by the British government and dispatched to our Consulate in Berlin. Ostensibly, he was in charge of passport control; in fact, he was an SIS officer – something that the government has taken the exceptional step of publicly confirming.
After Hitler came to power in 1933, Foley used his official position to issue visas to thousands of Jews trying to escape Germany. He applied the rules with what might be called sympathetic flexibility.
British visas could only be given to people with financial guarantees, a requirement that ruled out many Jewish applicants. So Foley invented a variety of ways to get around bureaucracy.
Richard Lachs, a Jewish company administrator, was one of many desperate people with no chance of providing any guarantees. Penniless and unemployed, he had been hounded out of his job in Cologne and forced to take his family into hiding after the Kristallnacht pogroms.
He sought asylum in the United States, only to be rejected because the quota was full. So he then applied for British visas for himself, his wife and their 2 children, with no guarantees – and little hope of success.
Richard Lachs’s son, Werner, remembered what happened. “It was a Sunday morning,” he said. “A friend was there, and the post produced a letter from the British Passport Control Office in Berlin, requesting that my parents should send their passports to receive their visas. We just jumped up and down for joy.”
The Lachs family did not know it, but Foley found a way of overlooking the regulations. He appears to have decided that since someone else called Lachs had previously been granted a visa, that person’s guarantee could be taken to cover Richard Lachs and his family as well. “I am 99% certain,” said Werner Lachs, “that but for Mr Foley, I and my family might have become another statistic of the Holocaust”.
Today, Werner Lachs is 92. He has nine grandchildren, four great-grandchildren and he lives in Prestwich.
A few months before the outbreak of war in 1939, Foley arranged visas for a 24-year-old Jew called Gunter Powitzer and his infant son, Walter. Yet, by the time the documents were ready, Powitzer had already been interned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp.
So Foley went to the camp himself and demanded the prisoner’s release, explaining that since Powitzer now held a British visa and was entitled to British protection. Powitzer, who had recently been flogged, remembered how he was “bandaged, cleaned up and shaved” and presented to a “small man wearing glasses”.
“My name is Foley,” said the visitor. “I am from the British Consulate in Berlin.”
The following day, Powitzer was released from Sachsenhausen, reunited with his son and allowed to reach safety in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. Had Foley not acted, Powitzer would have stayed in the camp where 30,000 inmates would be murdered by 1945.
Nearly 70 years later, when a statue was raised to Foley in the Somerset town of his birth, a man called Asher Rubin wrote from Israel, “Frank Foley saved me and my father, Gunter Powitzer. Foley’s efforts are responsible for the lives of our family.”
I hope SIS will forgive me if I add that Foley made good use of what is euphemistically called ‘tradecraft’. He would direct Jews to reliable suppliers of fake passports. He would place them in touch with SIS contacts who knew exactly how to cross the Swiss frontier. And he kept up a steady barrage of requests to London for more visas and more permits for Jews to settle in Palestine.
Yet, as the Ambassador alluded to, the bleak truth is that not everyone in the British government of the day possessed the same moral clarity or the will to confront the realities of Hitlerism. The policy of appeasement, no matter how well intentioned, was futile and morally bankrupt.
We should reflect that it was not the state as a whole, but remarkable individuals like Frank Foley who did the right thing, made the correct moral choice, often in defiance of the rules.
So here I ask: what would each of us have done if we had been in his place?
Frank Foley died in 1958 having observed the code of his profession and kept silent about his service. Four decades passed before Michael Smith wrote his biography and he began to receive the posthumous recognition. In 1999, Yad Vashem decided to honour Foley as one of the Righteous Among Nations. One of the Jews he saved happens to be the father-in-law of my cabinet colleague, James Brokenshire. Others include the grandparents of an SIS officer who is serving today.
Thanks to Foley, many people were spared the ordeal that Primo Levi endured and chronicled. But even as we take pride in the memory of Frank Foley, we should never lose sight of the hard truth that when the crucial moment came and the moral test was posed, there were too few people like him.
So today, we draw inspiration from his example, and we hope that those inspired will thus never be the next people to look away in the face of atrocity.
Thank you.
",2019 Speech at International Holocaust Remembrance Day,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/jeremy-hunt-2019-speech-at-international-holocaust-remembrance-day/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2013-08-05,"Hi, Greta.
Well, with what's going on in the country, and that includes the president, this is not a good time to be taking vacations. You lead by example, and vacations is not what this country wants to see right now. You have a debt ceiling coming up. You have lots of other things happening. The country's a mess.
We have $17 trillion now in debt, which is hard to believe, but $17 trillion. This is not a good time to be taking a vacation.
Well, it's amazing how great air-conditioning systems work today. I'm just installing a big one in Doral, and they really do work very well. So that's no longer an excuse, although, I guess -- I don't know. This is the problem. When they use an excuse like that, we have problems.
Well, I think it makes a big difference because we go back to the word ""certainty."" We've had so little certainty in this country. We don't know what's going to happen with the debt ceiling. Is it going to be a war again or is it going to be easily approved? Well, we think it's probably not going to be easily approved.
Will it be approved? So you really have to get to work on this stuff. It's complex. There's a huge negotiation, and you know, many of the people we're talking about, they've never negotiated before. They've never been in private business. They don't know what it is to make a payroll or look at a balance sheet.
And frankly, for them to be going away right now sets such a bad example for the country and even the world to watch.
Well, I think the president has to lead. You know, it all starts at the top, and you have a man that's going to be the leader and he's got to call everybody together, and he's got to say, Come on, let's not leave. Let's all sit together. Come to the White House. Come to wherever you want to come, and let's get together and make a deal.
But there doesn't seem to be that kind of talk. A lot of people want to make deals, but the deals are so divergent and so different, and you have non-deal makers having to make a very complicated deal. And yet, actually, if you look at it, it's not so complicated. It's pretty obvious what has to be done.
But you're dealing with non-deal makers, and in the case of the president, you're not talking about a deal maker. You have to have great leadership, and if the leadership isn't going to come to fore, it's going to be a big problem. And I'll tell you what. Come later on, September 30th, you could have a real disaster in this country.
Well, they do and some don't. You know, we've had some very, very hard-working presidents, and we've had some that are legendary for not having worked so hard. But in this case, we really need leadership. We've never been in a position where we owe $17 trillion, a lot of it to the Chinese, by the way -- $17 trillion.
We've never been in that position. And it can be solved. This country has such incredible potential and economic potential. And by the way, you mention the word economics and you mention financial, that's good in terms of Social Security. It's good in terms of Medicare and Medicaid. We need wealth to take care of people.
I mean, it's not a bad word. Wealth is not a bad word. We need it to take care of people. But you have to have somebody that knows what he or she is doing.
Well, the reason is that Bob Vander Plaats, who's a great guy, who's the leader there as far as that's concerned, and a religious leader and a great one, is a friend of mine and he asked me if I'd go. And I said yes, and a lot of people are reading a lot of things into that. But I did say yes, and I will say this in a very bragaddocious manner.
Tickets are going through the roof. Are you surprised by that, Greta?
Well, I have an interest in the country, and the country is doing poorly. And it's probably never done so poorly, and yet it's disguised a little bit because the stock market is up and other things are up. But we have a real unemployment rate of 15 or 16 percent. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that, not 7.4 percent.
Well, you have to put people back to work, yes. You have to stop foreign countries from making all our goods, all our products through manipulation of their currency. I mean, that's how they're making it. We make better product than China. We make a much better product. But when they manipulate their currency, it makes it impossible for us to buy in our own country.
People are not going to be working. So you have a vast unemployment rate, and we have to put these people back to work. We have to get foreign countries to stop outsmarting our politicians, which is what they're doing.
Well, if I decided to run -- I backed Mitt Romney. If I decided to run -- I was leading in all the polls. If I decided to run and if I won, I think we'd be in a lot better shape right now. And I wouldn't be on vacation.
I think it's great. Look, he's been taking this stuff all of his life, and when he stopped taking it, he became a lousy baseball player, or certainly just less than average. I think it's great. And it sets an example. And he's not very popular in New York. Nobody likes him. He lived in one of my buildings, Derek Jeter likewise and many of the Yankees.
And many of the players live in my buildings, and I can tell you the ones that people like and the ones that people don't like. If I say to the doorman, What do you think of Derek? Oh, we love Derek. If I say, What do you think of A-Rod? It's, like, forget it. So look, he deserves what he gets. He's been doing this for a long time.
And frankly, I don't understand the Yankees. The Yankees should have stopped paying him two years ago because, obviously, on the contract, what he signed was not what they were bargaining for. So I don't understand why the Yankees kept paying him, but maybe they're very generous. Who knows?
Absolutely yes. You know, you look at some of this stuff and you see -- Pete Rose is the number one all-time leading hits leader in baseball, over 4,000 hits. He's paid a big price. Absolutely, it's time to let Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame. And by the way, virtually everybody agrees with me. Pete Rose should be in the Hall of Fame.
Thanks a lot, Greta.
",Interview: Greta Van Susteren Interviews Donald Trump on Fox News' On the Record,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-van-susteren-fox-august-5-2013
Jimmy Carter,United States of America,1976-10-22 00:00:00,"Well, I might say first of all, that I think in case of a Carter administration, the sacrifices would be much less. Mr. Ford's own environmental agency has projected a 10-percent unemployment rate by 1978 if be is President. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process, if they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort that we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this is one example where a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember in 1973, in the depth of the energy crisis, when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice to cut down on the waste of gasoline, to cut down on the speed of automobiles. It was a tremendous surge of patriotism. ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country?I think we could call together--with strong leadership in the White House-business, industry, and labor, and say, let's have voluntary price restraints, let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation. We could also have an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme, for instance, of some welfare recipients who, by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the Medicaid laws, and the food stamp laws, make over $10,000 a year, and they don't have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme just I percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage, and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who is still working for a living. And they have to pay for the rich who have the privilege and for the poor who are not working. But I think that a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it, and striving for unselfishness could help, as it did in 1973, to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know I'm ready for it; I think the American people are, too.
I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we've experienced ever since 1960 bas been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials. When you've got 7 1/2, 8 million people out of work, when you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last 8-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history, when you have it becoming increasingly difficult for a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there is a natural inclination to be turned off. Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and Watergate and the CIA revelations, people have felt that they've been betrayed by public officials. I have to admit that in the heat of the campaign--I've been in 30 primaries during the springtime; I've been campaigning for 22 months--I've made some mistakes. And I think this is part of just being a human being. I have to say that my campaign has been an open one. The Playboy thing bas been of very great concern to me. I don't know how to deal with it exactly. I agreed to give the interview to Playboy. Other people have done it who are notable--Governor Jerry Brown, Walter Cronkite, Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own Secretary of Treasury, Mr. Simon, William Buckley, many other people. But they weren't running for President. And in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that interview had I to do it over again. If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my deep Christian beliefs and condemnation and sinfulness, l would use another forum besides Playboy. But I can say this: I'm doing the best I can to get away from that. And during the next 10 days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running television advertisements or newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character. I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign. And I hope that we can leave those issues, in the next 10 days, about personalities and mistakes of the past--we've both matte some mistakes--and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last 10 days.
I don't have any response.
In the last 2 weeks I've had a chance to talk to two men who have visited the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and China. One is Governor Averell Harriman,1 who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other one is James Schlesinger,2 whom I think you accompanied to China. I got a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished gentlemen.1 Governor of New York 1954-58 and Ambassador at Large 1961, 1965-68.2Secretary of Defense 1973-75.Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no prospect, in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading Yugoslavia should Mr. Tito pass away. The present leadership there is fairly uniform in their purpose. I think it's a close-knit group, and I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war in Yugoslavia if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing. I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign--and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question--that I would never go to war, become militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country, unless our own security was directly threatened. And I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went into Yugoslavia. I don't believe it will happen. I certainly hope it won't. I would take the strongest possible measures short of actual military action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.
No, I did not.
Well, just briefly, I think this is the second time that General Brown has made a statement for which he did have to apologize--and I know that everybody makes mistakes. I think the first one was related to the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and in the Congress. This one concerned Great Britain. I think he said Israel was a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. I am not sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had expressed his concern about the statement or apologized for it. This is something, though, that I think is indicative of a need among the American people to know how the Commander in Chief, the President, feels. And I think the only criticism that I would have of Mr. Ford is that immediately when the statement was revealed, perhaps a statement from the President would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.
I don't believe it does. I began campaigning 22 months ago. At that time nobody thought I had a chance to win. Very few people knew who I was. I came from a tiny town, as you know--Plains--and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets, barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines, also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns, and we talked a lot and we listened a lot, and we learned from the American people. We built up an awareness among the voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered--30 of them, nobody has ever done that before--about who I was and what I stood for. Now we have a very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization-I'd say several hundred of them, and they are very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination-and I share this with President Ford--is the choice of the Vice President. I think this would be indicative of the kind of leaders that I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion that I have put forward in my own mind was, who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be President if something should happen to me and to join me in being Vice President if I should serve out my term? And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice. And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people that I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I have never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his primary consideration--who is the best person I could choose in this country to be President of the United States. I feel completely at ease knowing that some day Senator Mondale might very well be President. In the last five Vice-Presidential nominees, incumbents, three of them have become President. But I think this is indicative of what I would do.
Well, I might say I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right. This administration's record of environment is very bad. I think it's accurate to say that the strip mining law, which was passed twice by the Congress and only lacked two votes, I believe, of being overridden, would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put 140,000 miners out of work is hard to believe when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was supporting the bill. And I don't think they would have supported the bill had they known that they would lose 140,000 jobs. There has been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or to delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both Presidents Nixon and Ford, moneys have been impounded that would have gone to cities and others to control water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy to permit us to plan, in an orderly way, how to shift from increasing the scarce energy forms--oil--and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor--the research and development to be used primarily to make the coal burning be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have geological and archeological importance, natural areas for enjoyment. The lands that Mr. Ford brags about having approved are in Alaska, and they are enormous in size, but as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, is very far in the future. We have taken no strong position in the control of pollution of our oceans. And I would say the worst threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for 2 years or more, has still not taken a strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium. Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration. I would do the opposite in every respect.
Yes, I would be glad to. In the first place, as is the case with the environmental policy and energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It's impossible for mayors or Governors to cooperate with the President, because they can't anticipate what is going to happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for example, needs to know 18 months or 2 years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing, in things like housing, pollution control, crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford To New York--Drop Dead.""I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the Federal Government. Quite often, Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and better education programs and so forth. Those programs were designed to help those who need it most, and quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the greatly advantaged persons who live in the suburbs--better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are--quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed. Also, I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments and also to remove the prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money, so that it can be used to improve education and health care. We have now, for instance, only 7 percent of the total education costs being financed by the Federal Government. When the Nixon-Ford administration started, this was 10 percent. That's a 30-percent reduction in the portion that the Federal Government contributes to education in just 8 years and, as you know, the education costs have gone up tremendously. The last point is that the major thrust has got to be to put people back to work. We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown, urban ghetto areas; particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare costs. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of New York City is to finance welfare. And I favor the shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether and, over a longer period of time, let the Federal Government begin to absorb part of it that is now paid by the State government. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a very serious problem there.
The description just made of this administration's record is hard to recognize. I think it is accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the voting rights acts and against the civil rights acts in their debative stage. I think once it was assured they were going to pass, he finally voted for it. This country changed drastically in 1969 when the terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over, and Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford became the Presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who were poor and downtrodden and who were elderly or who were ill or who were in minority groups. That time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the civil rights acts and the opening up of opportunities to black people, to have a chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated black people but it also liberated the whites. We have seen in many instances in recent years a minority affairs section of a small loan administration, Small Business Administration, lend a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up an extraordinary degree. The FHA , which used to be a very responsible agency that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost $600 million last year. There have been over 1,300 indictments in HUD, over 800 convictions relating just to home loans. And now the Federal Government has become the world's greatest slum landlord. We've got a 30-percent or 40-percent unemployment rate among minority young people. And there has been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And that's where there has been a great generation of despair and ill-health and lack of education and lack of purposefulness and a lack of hope for the future. But it doesn't take just a quiet, dormant, minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And that's been lacking in the last 8 years.
I would not work hard to support any of those. We have always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed but the passage of them has been fairly slow and few and far between. In the 200-year history, there has been a very cautious approach to this. Quite often we have a transient problem. I am strongly against abortion. I think abortion is wrong. I don't think the Government ought to do anything to encourage abortion, but I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject. But short of a constitutional amendment, and within the confines of a Supreme Court ruling, I will do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures. I personally don't believe that the Federal Government ought to finance abortions, but I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment. However, I honor the right of people to seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on prayer in the schools, and on abortion, but among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.
I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed. Earlier, Mr. Levi, his Attorney General, put forward a gun control proposal which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused that called for the prohibition against the sale of the so-called ""Saturday night specials."" It would have put very strict control over who owned a handgun. I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun. And the only purpose that I would see in registering handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the ownership of those guns by those who have used them in the commission of a crime or who have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun. I believe that limited approach to the question would be advisable, and I think adequate, but that's as far as I would go with it.
While I was Governor of Georgia, although I am not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system. We streamlined the structure of the courts, put in administrative offices, put a unified court system in, and required that all severe sentences be reviewed for uniformity; and, in addition to that, put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office--selection of all judges and district attorneys, prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court--and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total, and about half of the Court of Appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges--I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia, and from those five I always chose the first or second one. So, merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as President, not only in judicial appointments but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights has been confirmed by the Burger Court. It hasn't been reversed. And I don't think there is any inclination to reverse those basic decisions--of the one man-one vote rule, which is a very important one that struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of sparsely populated areas of the States. The right of indigent or very poor accused persons to legal counsel--I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court. Also, the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false confession. But now, I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty. And I think that in that case some of the more liberal members of the so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions. But the only thing that I have pointed out was what I've just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn't be forced to release a person who is obviously guilty just because of a small technicality in the law. And that's a reversal of position by the Burger Court with which I do agree.
Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit. Once the search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I am given a list of the 5 or 7 or 10 best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those persons. If the list was in my opinion fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic political philosophy, as best as I could determine it, which would be to continue the progress that has been made under the last two Courts--the Warren Court and the Burger Court. I would also like to completely revise our criminal justice system to do some of the things at the Federal level and court reform that I just described, as has been done in Georgia and other States. And I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that. I know Chief Justice Burger is. He hasn't had help yet from the administration and from the Congress to carry this out. The emphasis, I think, of the court system should be to interpret the Constitution and the laws equally between property protection and personal protection. But when there is a very narrow decision--which quite often is one that reaches the Supreme Court--I think the choice should be with human rights, and that would be another factor that I would follow.
I think the answer as to the kind of person that I would select is obvious. I had one opportunity to nominate an individual to the Supreme Court, and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, John Paul Stevens. I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals judge. And I was very pleased that an overwhelmingly Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming. So, I would say somebody in the format of Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would select in the future, as I did him in the past. I believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the Burger Court vis-a-vis the Court that preceded it. It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the police, the law enforcement people in this country, to do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes were properly handled and sent to jail. The Miranda case, the Burger Court is gradually changing. And I am pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision. I might make a correction of what Governor Carter said, speaking of gun control. Yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of Saturday night specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.>
Well, with all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of making that statement because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression, caused by Herbert Hoover, and the time President Ford took office. We have got 7 1/2 million people out of jobs. Since he has been in office, 2? million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last 4 months alone, 500,000 Americans have gone on the unemployment rolls. In the last month, we've had a net loss of 163,000 jobs. Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. One of the overwhelming results that I have seen in places is people feel that you can't plan any more, there is no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kids through college. Saving accounts are losing money instead of gaining money. Inflation is robbing us. Under the present administrations--Nixon's and Ford's--we have had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts--he compares the housing starts with last year, I don't blame him because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built than any year since 1940. That's 35 years. And we've got a 35-percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers. And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it. And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines--job opportunities for 2 million Americans. We will never have a balanced budget, we will never meet the needs of our people, we will never control the inflationary spiral as long as we have 7? or 8 million people out of work who are looking for jobs. And we have probably got 2? more million people who are not looking for jobs any more because they've given up hope. That is a very serious indictment of this administration. It's probably the worst one of all.
Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened. When I was that far ahead it was immediately following the Democratic Convention and before the Republican Convention. At that time 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford, but as occurred at the end of the Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself, and I think immediately following the Republican Convention there was about a 10-point spread. I believe that to be accurate. I had 49 percent; President Ford had 39 percent. The polls are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another, and the only poll I've ever followed is the one that, you know, is taken on Election Day. I was in 30 primaries in the spring and at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the polls. As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December 1975, they didn't even put my name on the list. They had 35 people on the list--my name wasn't even there. At the beginning of the year, I had about 2 percent. So the polls, to me, are interesting, but they don't determine my hopes or my despair. I campaign among people. I have never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of thousands of people around the country who actively campaign for me. In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were 14 people in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia. That is an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best. And today we have about 500 Georgians at their own expense, just working people who believe in me, spread around the country involved in the political campaign. So the polls are interesting, but I don't know how to explain the fluctuations. I think a lot of it depends on current events--sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs. But I think our core of support among those who are crucial to the election has been fairly steady. And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's outside of Washington, who never has been a part of the Washington establishment. And I think that we will have a good result on November 2 for myself and I hope for the country.
The major purpose of an election for President is to choose a leader, someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country, to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficulties, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity. I don't believe the present administration has done that. We have been discouraged and we've been alienated, sometimes we've been embarrassed, sometimes we've been ashamed. Our people are out of work, and there is a sense of withdrawal. But our country is innately very strong. Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he has been in office now more than 800 days, approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office. I would like to ask the American people what has been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member and a library board member, I served on a hospital authority, and I was in the State senate, and I was Governor and I am an engineer, a naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress and can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace and needs to be reformed, I was Governor of Georgia for 4 years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property taxes. As a matter of fact, the year before we went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend $600 per person in this country--every man, woman, and child-for health care. We still rank 15th among all of the nations in the world in infant mortality, and our cancer rate is higher than any country in the world. We don't have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. We have become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did 8 years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people want to go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government, and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have gone bad. It used to be that the average family could own a house, but now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country--$65 billion--primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the Government bureaucracy is just a horrible mess. This doesn't have to be. I don't know all of the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our Nation is greater than what we are now,"" I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with Government at all levels, we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to it, but I believe together we can make great progress, we can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. We have been drifting too long. We have been dormant too long. We have been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people, but I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country, and with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things and let the world know--that's very important, but more importantly, let the people in our own country realize--that we still live in the greatest Nation on Earth. Thank you very much.

What happened is such a tragedy. So unnecessary -- who can believe what happened in Las Vegas. Great love for the people, great love for the people of our country, and I look forward to going tomorrow.
The First Lady will be coming with me, and we’re going to be paying our respects and condolences. We’ll be leaving early in the morning.
We are here on this great ship today, and I want to thank the admiral; I want to thank the captain very much. Thank you very much. This is some ship.
Most people would never know a ship like this exists. This is for helicopters of all sizes and types, and it’s quite something. And it’s done a tremendous service for Puerto Rico and for the U.S. Virgin Islands.
And we’re really -- we were so nicely treated by the U.S. Virgin Islands, frankly, over the years. They’re great people, and we’re helping out.
And we have with us Governor Kenneth Mapp, who has been very generous with what he said about Brock, about everybody at FEMA, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, the whole thing. And Kenneth, we very much appreciate your remarks, and I appreciate it very much.
And we’re really here right now for you. We have -- because of the size, the massive size of the airplane, the runways can’t handle it. But the runways have now handled it. They’ve been open, and they’re handling a lot of aircraft and a lot of help.
And your people have been very resilient, and they have done a great job. They’re already starting the rebuilding process. And you got hit twice. You were hit very hard.
In 12 days, you got hit twice. And Puerto Rico got hit twice. They had a grazing one that actually the United States took a lot of brunt from, and then they got hit by Maria, and that was dead center.
So Kenneth, thank you very much. I very appreciate it. Would you like to say something?
Thank you. They are wonderful people too, and I really appreciate that. I feel that we’re old friends, you know, because we’ve spoken so many times over the last month. And you are -- you have done a terrific job.
And as you know, your friend, the governor of Puerto Rico happens to be here --
-- and a congresswoman representing 3.5 million people in Puerto Rico. And thank you, Jenniffer.
That’s very appropriate now, though, maybe more so than ever, really. Thank you very much. And Governor, thank you very much.

Clement Attlee,United Kingdom,2016-01-09,"His Majesty the King and his gracious Consort the Queen have shared our anxieties, our tribulations and our sufferings during the war, and the shadow of bereavement has fallen on them as it has fallen on the homes of their people. The King and Queen have throughout set us an example of courage and devotion which will not be forgotten. By this, and by their sympathy, they have strengthened the bond uniting them to their people. This bond is no mere constitutional formality, but the basis of the deep affection and understanding which, I believe, have been strengthened by the experiences through which we have passed.
However well and skilfully constitutions may be framed they depend in the last resort on the willingness and ability of human beings to make them work. Our British Constitution, in war and peace, works because the people understand it and know by long experience how to operate it. A constitutional monarchy depends for its success to a great extent on the understanding heart of the monarch. In this country we are blessed with a King who, as my right hon. Friend said, combines with an intense love of our country and all his people, a thorough appreciation of our Parliament and democratic Constitution. In the difficult times ahead I believe that the harmonious working of our Constitution, in which the people’s will is expressed by King and Parliament, will be an example of stability in a disordered world. It is, therefore, to my mind, a fortunate thing that this new Parliament, like its predecessor, should, in this Address, have the opportunity of expressing its feeling, and of giving thanks to the Sovereign.

Thank you Secretary Chao for your service, and for your great leadership as we rebuild America, which is exactly what we're doing. It's going ahead of schedule. It's wonderful to be joined by so many incredible leaders from our state departments of transportatation from all over the country.
You're really the stewards of the vast majority of our nations' roads, and bridges, and so many other things. I know you just had a very productive discussion about ways the federal government can help expedite vital infrastructure products, which is what we're doing today and that's what we're all about today, and even this week, I have to say. We call it Infrastructure Week.
We are working very hard to reduce the permitting and approval process on major projects from 10 years down to the shortest time possible. Yesterday I said two years or less, I'd like to say one year would be realy the number. A highway today takes years and years and years to get approved -- sometimes as much as 15 or 17 years. By the time they get the approvals, they need a different highway. So we don't want that.
We want to partner with state leaders, like you, to fix our crumbling infrastructure, build new shining monuments to our magnificent nation, and we are going to massively streamline that process. Faster approvals and innovative partnerships with the state, local and private sector leaders will translate into dramatic improvements all across the country.
And we're starting to see the fruits of our labor -- starting to see it very, very quickly already, and it hasn't been very long that we've been in office. Our infrastructure will once again be the envy of the world.
Right now it's being scoffed at and laughed at -- it will once again be the envy of the world. Thank you for joining us today, I look forward to hearing from you, and I think what we'll do is we'll around, you can introduce yourself and where you're from, and we'll start... Ray.

The problem at which my Bill is aimed to provide some solution is well known to hon. Members on both sides of the House and was very well aired by my hon.
It is important for the House to look forward to the publication of the Nugee report. I hope that hon. Members who, like myself, have this problem in their constituencies will have the forgiveness of the House if they come forward, even at this late stage, with some specific recommendations which they hope will be helpful.
It has often been pointed out that we have a certain unbalance where the acquisition of residential freehold is concerned. The House long ago agreed that in the private sector those living in houses on long leases should have the right of enfranchisement and be able to enjoy the benefit of freehold ownership. In the public sector the Government have made tremendous strides, which we all appreciate and are grateful for, by allowing people in council houses, and also in council flats, to acquire their own property. But people living in flats in private ownership are, as it were, second-rate citizens, because they do not have the right at present to acquire their freehold. I believe that a formula can be found, which is fair to both sides, that will encourage this type of home ownership for people living in flats.
The Bill would specify that in order to exercise the right of purchase a company — which I suggest might be known as a condominium company, making use of an expression which is very well understood in the United States—could be formed, in accordance with a model ​ constitution, which would include provisions to ensure that a block of flats acquired by the tenants under the Bill’s provisions would be properly managed. There is a danger that enthusiastic tenants’ associations might overreach themselves by acquiring properties which were in need of serious repair and then find that they could not raise enough money among themselves to look after the block properly. That, of course, would lead to dissension and bad feeling, such as there was in the days when there were two sides and the owners were reluctant to find the necessary capital and the people living in the flats felt that the block was being neglected.
The Bill would grant to a properly constituted condominium company the right of pre-emption, to be exercised within a maximum of six months. That, I think, is not very controversial. When a block has been put on the market, most people feel that a tenants’ or residents’ association, if it acts quickly and responsibly, should have a right of pre-emption. I hope that that will be one of the recommendations of the Nugee report. However, the Bill would only extend the right to require the owner to enter into negotiations to dispose of his interest in other circumstances where all the flats in the property are held on long lease.
The difficulty is one of valuation. Where there are mixed regimes in ‘a block, it is extremely difficult for even the most experienced and fair-minded person to know what is a fair price for the block, because estimates have to be made of the dates on which flats under controlled rents may become available, and vacant possession will enable the owner to make a substantial gain on those particular flats.
The payments to be made by the company to acquire the building would be based on a valuation prepared in accordance with principles laid down in the Bill and provide a reasonable assessment of the current value of the vendor’s interest. There should be no question whatever of the right being extended to the residents of purchasing the property on confiscatory terms. The valuation should take into account the different forms of tenure in the property and the market value of any ancillary properties, such as shops, offices or other non-residential premises integral to the block. The valuation should be subject to arbitration.
To encourage continuity of ownership, the Bill provides that if any tenant of a flat belonging to a co-ownership scheme of the type envisaged by the Bill should sell his flat within a short period after the acquisition of the building by the tenants’ company, any profit he makes would be shared with the company on a sliding scale designed to give the company the main benefit of any windfall capital gains, particularly in the early years.
Where difficulties arise in the relationships between the residents and the owners or their managing agents, the right will be conferred on the residents to apply to the court ​ in certain circumstances for the appointment of a managing trustee. This new suggestion which I am making in this Bill is, I believe, an extremely practical solution to the type of deadlock situations which occur all too often, unfortunately, in mansion blocks where tenants have a deep suspicion of the intentions of the managing agents and nothing can be done about maintenance or even routine upkeep of the block because the tenants’ association is not prepared to agree to the normal operation of the service charges.
It would be permissible for a condominium company to issue debentures and also participating preference shares; and it could qualify for grant on the same terms as a housing association. I am very anxious that a residents’ association, properly constituted, should have assistance in the early years from building societies and other financial institutions. All too often they are reluctant to lend money on fixed-interest terms, but willing to enter into some sort of participatory arrangement so that they can take their money out after a relatively short time with an element of profit involved. That would encourage outside finance to come to the aid of residents’ associations and give them a practical opportunity of meeting the price which they have to meet if they are going to take the chance to buy the block when it is offered to them.
I am hoping to repeat in my Bill the schedule, which is a model memorandum and articles for a condominium company.
Even if my Bill were to make no progress, the fact that it was available in print would, we think, be of use to many people thinking of setting up residents’ associations. I hope, therefore, that the House will give me leave to reintroduce my Bill.
",1985 Speech on Co-Ownership Of Flats,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/brandon-rhys-williams-1985-speech-on-co-ownership-of-flats/
Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2016-01-17,"Good morning, Chuck.
Absolutely. Look I have said for a long time that I'm very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program but I've also said that the way we're going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U.N. Security Council has put on, including on missiles.
So I see these as mutually reinforcing, Chuck. I was delighted that the prisoners are on their way home. That's a good sign. We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, there's more work to be done there. But if the implementation of the agreement which is being done today is to be successful in the way that I expect we're going to watch Iran like the proverbial hawk.
And when it comes to the missile program, they are under U.N. Security Council sanctions and if they are violating it which the evidence seems to suggest they should be held accountable. They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that we're going to continue to be focused on.
Well, certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East. They continue to support proxies and terrorist groups like Hezbollah. They continue to threaten Israel. There are a lot of concerns. But what I've said for some time now is I'd rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening, certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us.
Well, first of all, Chuck, I always thought this was going to be close and I can't speak for anybody else but I've worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa, to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1.
And I've also been very consistent over the course of my public life. If I tell you I'm going to fight for something, I will do my very best to get results. I think that's why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but we're going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1.
Oh, I don't know how people take all this information. But I support a free market economy. I support the competitiveness that has created the greatest economic engine in the history of the world. What I am worried about is that it's not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead.
That's why I've got a very vigorous jobs agenda. That's why I put raising incomes at the center of my economic policy and I think what I know will work is to get back the good old-fashioned job opportunities that will help people get ahead through manufacturing, through infrastructure, through clean energy, through the kinds of plans that I've been putting out.
Look, when we have a Democrat in the White House—a Democrat—we do that better economically. We saw that when my husband was president, we've watched President Obama dig us out of the huge ditch that Republican policies put us into, so I'm very confident that I know what will work if we have a—the right commitment as a nation and that's what I want to do as president.
Look, like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald. I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and, in fact, urged that it include the entire Chicago police department.
This is not a problem that is unique to Chicago, unfortunately, and we've got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated. Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard.
Well, that's going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove.
Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation, is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation, the answer to that is yes. That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything.
And I can't speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization. I testified for more than 11 hours, as you know I answered every question I was asked. My real focus, Chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm's way—military or civilian, diplomats or our soldiers—we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Well, I think it's just typical political rhetoric, and it overlooks some very basic, important issues.
Number one, we always try to get Americans back who are unjustly held. I certainly did when I was secretary of state. And when I was a senator, I advocated for the Bush administration to do the same for people who have been unlawfully held in foreign countries.
Secondly, the important news here is that the Iranian agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program of Iran is being implemented. The Iranians have so far fulfilled their side of the bargain by destroying centrifuges, by shipping out 98 percent or so of their enriched uranium out of their country, even making one of their plutonium reactors under construction no longer able to be ever used because they have poured cement into it.
So, the real issue here is, if you're committed to making the world safer and to show strong American leadership, you have to engage in patient, persistent diplomacy with people who are not your friends. They are on the other side of a lot of the issues and values that you hold very dear, and that is certainly true for the United States.
Well, I regret deeply that Robert Levinson was not on his way home either. And I hope and expect that the Iranians will continue to be pressed very, very hard to give up any information they have and, if possible, to return Bob Levinson to his home and family.
Well, I am pleased that Senator Sanders has flip-flopped on legal immunity for gun makers and sellers. Now I hope he will also join members of Congress to change what's called the Charleston loophole that enabled the killer in Charleston to get the gun that he used to murder nine people at Bible study here in Mother Emanuel Church. That's something else Senator Sanders has supported that we need to change.
So, now I'm calling on him to also flip-flop in the right direction and sign on the legislation to change the Charleston loophole.
Well, I do support the Second Amendment. That has always been understood.
I just believe that, like any amendment to our Constitution, there are reasonable steps that can be taken. We have reasonable restrictions on certain kind of speech or certain forms of assembly. And for goodness sakes, we ought to be smart enough and do so consistent with the Constitution, to have more gun safety measures to try to save some of the 33,000 lives that we lose to gun violence every single year.
This is something that I have spoken out about, that I have advocated for right now. I think there is a consensus in the country on comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online and Charleston loopholes, reversing the immunity given to the gun industry, certainly prohibiting would-be terrorists on the no-fly zone from buying guns.
That's kind of the commonsense approach that we should be working to achieve.
Well, John, this is an issue I have been involved in now for a couple of weeks. I am horrified by what has happened in Flint.
I started calling for immediate action, calling for federal intervention. I sent two of my top campaign aides to meet with the mayor of Flint. As you may know, I appeared on a show this past week and demanded that Governor Snyder ask for the help that Michigan needs to deal with the horrible consequences that children and their families are facing in Flint.
And I saw that Governor Snyder turned around within two hours and finally asked for the help that he should have asked for some weeks ago. I don't want to get caught up in the political back and forth here. I want to help the people of Flint.
And I particularly want a comprehensive health analysis of what's happened to these children. Lead is a poison. It destroys your brain. It interferes with your learning and your behavior. Whatever it takes for Michigan and the federal government to come together, through FEMA, through Health and Human Services, the EPA, whatever it takes, we now have to fix the problem and help these kids and especially their health and education development probably for years to come.
Well, I think it's very confusing, because he hasn't put forward a plan.
And the only way we know what it is he's advocating for comes from looking at the nine bills that he's introduced in the House and Senate and Congress. And in those bills, every kind of health care is rolled all up together, and handed over to the states, which bear a financial responsibility to match what the federal government provides in order to administer health care.
So, it's not a traditional kind of single-payer system, as I understand it. It is a state-based system, kind of similar to Medicaid, if you will. And I do think there are very legitimate questions that can be raised, and because we don't have an up-to-date plan from Senator Sanders, all of us trying to figure out what it would mean for everybody to be put into that new system.
Great to talk to you again, John.

Michael Ellis,United Kingdom,2019-01-22,"I am delighted to be here with you all today.
Thank you for inviting me to speak at this important launch. Let me first take the opportunity to thank the Theatres Trust for your contribution to arts and culture. You have continuously campaigned to ensure that theatre buildings, many of them with historical and cultural significance, are protected for generations to come.
It is vital that we continue to invest in arts and culture. This investment can help develop lifelong passions and create new opportunities for work.
Creativity, arts and heritage make our communities better places to live and theatres are an incredibly important part of that.
We know that British theatre is respected for its high-quality output and the skilled professionals, both on and off the stage, who keep the industry running. Theatre in England is vibrant and thriving, with a diverse range of artists and companies producing exciting and varied work.
A theatre can be a challenging but exciting place to work and I believe there are some great opportunities in the industry.
Not just for the highly-skilled and the longstanding practitioners of their craft, but for young people just starting out who can bring a fresh perspectives and hone their expertise.
Like you, this Government and I, are fully committed to ensuring that arts and culture are accessible to everyone.
To that end, theatres as physical buildings and the institutions that support them, take a central role when it comes to accessibility.
I am sure everyone here today is in agreement that anyone should be able to experience the magic of theatre. That audience members feel part of the work.
This is why the work of the Theatres Trust and their annual Theatres at Risk register plays such a significant role in ensuring we are all aware of some of these important cultural institutions which are at threat.
It is of great credit to the hard work of the Trust and the sector that two theatres that were on last years’ list have returned to live performance use – including the one where we are today – and two others are no longer at risk.
This is great news, thank you for work and your commitment to the industry.
It is also very pleasing to see that a number of other theatres, such as the Burnley Empire and the Bradford Odeon, amongst others have been making progress in securing their futures. I very much hope that this progress continues.
We know many of the Theatres on the list are experiencing financial problems.
We also know that the cultural and creative industries make a vast contribution to our economy, accounting for over 5% of UK GVA, and the Government is committed to supporting their growth.
Culture also has a significant role to play in place-shaping, as it has important social benefits in terms of health, education, community cohesion and wellbeing. Opportunities to engage in culture – be it arts, heritage, museums or film – can have a significant impact on our lives and create places where people want to live, work and do business.
This is where the theatre, as a physical building, can play a central role in making places better areas to live, and instill a sense of community. And it may be that placemaking that can help to protect some of these cultural assets.
Evidence from the UK and other countries shows a link between cultural investment in towns and cities and economic growth. Culture, sport and heritage assets create thriving, interesting areas where people want to live, work and set-up businesses.
Creative businesses particularly benefit from clustering around cultural assets.
The impact of place-based investment in arts and culture on the attractiveness of a city or town as a place to live in and invest can also be seen in the transformative effect of Hull’s highly successful year as UK City of Culture 2017.
Since 2013, investment in Hull has amounted to £3.3 billion and the city’s employment rate and number of businesses are at the highest ever recorded rate, including over 550 new cultural jobs.
This is why it is so encouraging to see more and more theatres working outside their own walls and using their programmes to engage the communities that surround them.
It is my hope that by continuing with such innovative, entertaining and relevant programming, public interest in our theatres can only increase.
As announced by the Chancellor in the 2018 Budget Statement, DCMS will be providing £55 million as part of the Future High Streets fund, dedicated to supporting the regeneration of high street heritage assets. Those much loved historic buildings that provide a sense of place, community identity and connectedness.
£40 million of this fund will be delivered through my Department’s Arms Length Body and statutory advisor Historic England to support a high street focused version of their successful Heritage Action Zones scheme, and £15 million will be delivered through the Architectural Heritage Fund to support community groups to take ownership of heritage assets.
This programme will aim to support the economic growth and regeneration of towns and high streets across England by improving their physical and economic condition as well as increasing community and investor confidence, social cohesion and pride in our places.
The programme will help to bring about the regeneration of high streets and town centres by identifying, targeting and de-risking heritage assets as well as diversifying and optimising their uses to meet a range of community needs.
As I have set out, Government believes that place-based cultural investments should be a key part of the local growth strategy for all towns and cities in England.
This is why we have recently introduced the Cultural Development Fund, a fund for towns and cities that want to transform their urban areas through culture-led strategies. We received many strong bids from towns across England, and as some of you will know, the Secretary of State announced the winning bids on Friday last week.
Going forward, there are great opportunities for theatres to play a central role in our vision, and I am sure that with the support of Government, organisations like the Theatres Trust and Local Authorities, we can all work together to ensure that our much loved theatres can continue to thrive across the country.
I would like to thank Theatres Trust again for inviting me along today to speak to you all, and thank you all for the outstanding contributions you continue to make to our nation’s theatre.

Nancy Pelosi,United States of America,2020-06-02,"Good morning everyone. Keep our distances here. Thank you for being here as we enroll the Uyghur bill. This is legislation regarding Human Rights Policy ACT. I’m honored to be here with my colleague, a gentleman from New Jersey whom I’ve work for decades on the issue of human rights in China and throughout the world. This legislation sends a clear message to the government of China, that we are well aware of the abuse of human rights and as far as we, our community is concerned.
I want to thank him for his leadership and here in civil rights. Thank you. To thank him for his leadership and then also Senator Menendez, Senator Rubio has been a champion on this, Senator Risch, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Foreign Relation Committee they call it. Smith is a co-chair as well as the ranking member on the Congressional Executive Commission on China.
That is all to say in a bipartisan way, in a bicameral way, over the years, there has been a real commitment to shine a bright light on human rights violations in China and to say to those who are affected by that, you are not alone. You are not. A most excruciating form of torture that a president can give to those who they were oppressing is to say nobody remembers, nobody cares. Well, we do and we want China and the government to know that. So that’s why it’s such an honor to enroll this bill passed by the Senate and the House in a strong bipartisan way to send to the President to sign. This especially meaningful this week, June 4th, the 34th… Excuse me, 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.
So it was talking about the denial that the Chinese government is about that massacre 31 years later, whether you’re talking about oppression into there to eliminate the religion, the language, the culture of Tibet. The situation in the years we’ve been working together has not improved, sadly there. But we will never stop.
If we ever decide that for commercial reasons, we will not call attention to the human rights violations in China, we lose all moral authority comes speaking turn about human rights any place in the world. With that, again, I with great respect and gratitude to Mr. You know him in Congress, but very much still in the forefront on religious freedom and human rights throughout the world. Smith.
Thank you so much for your leadership and now I’m honored to sign, enroll this important legislation as we turn it over to the Senate.
Last night, when I was hoping the President would hold up the Bible, I was thinking of so many things in the Bible that would have been appropriate in terms of humanity, of all people in our country. We’re thinking about time. Time is such a most important commodity, the most important commodity, the most finite of all commodities. The time it takes to make the change necessary and it’s a long overdue time for us to make some of that change that people were calling out for.
“The time for every event under heaven,” he talks about a time to heal, he talks about a time to embrace and the time to show an embracing. How about that. Let’s focus upon the time to heal. The time to heal. We have had, as a role of President of the United States, a role of Commander in Chief, a President of United States, a person who has a responsibility to heal. President George Herbert Walker Bush spoke about similar circumstances similar to now when he said this was after the Rodney King beating.
President George Herbert Walker Bush said the following, “Those terrible scenes stir us all to demand an end to gratuitous violence and gratuitous brutality. Law enforcement officials cannot place themselves above the law that they are sworn to defend. It was sickening to see the beating that was rendered and there is no way, no way in my view, to explain that away.”
President Obama said after the murder of Eric Garner, “Right now, unfortunately we are seeing too many instances where people just do not have competency for folks who are being treated fairly. In some cases there may be misperceptions, but in some cases, that’s a reality.
This is an American problem. When anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that is a problem.” I do want to quote my colleague, Mr. He said this, “Fire, bombing, police cars, burning down businesses and ravaging our neighborhoods dishonors the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and will destroy thousands of livelihood.”
But it is about how we treat people and again, across our country, President Obama said the other day, many law enforcement people take pride in what they do and would not identify with his actions that were taken against Georgia Floyd, but in fact, it did happen and it happened in broad daylight.
It happened for all the world to see a knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder, but by three officers observing it. So, it’s time. It’s a time for us to address. That’s why the big concerns that were being expressed by the protestors. This is not an incident and a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. We also know the history that takes us to this sad place. That’s why I’m so proud of the work of the Congressional Black Caucus. We call that the Conscience of the Commons. The important work they’re doing, have been doing over time and now are ready to come forward with legislation, whether it’s to end racial profiling, or some of the other… a number of pieces of legislation to police brutality being a part of that, but racial profiling being such a universal affliction that we must be rid of.
So we will be making their recommendations. They will be having their town hall, their hearings. Of course, it is the responsibility of all of us to take the time to heal. But we are looking to them for their values-based, sad experience, and their leadership in terms of legislation. Congresswoman Madam Chair, Karen Bass of California has been very measured and deeply concerned about all of this working with our members. We have many legislative proposals. I wrote to them to prioritize security. We had some of us who, what some of the members who wanted to have a comprehensive bill, others, more individual approach. But in a matter of just a short period of time, those decisions will be made.
I think the American people will be well served. But we would hope that the President of the United States would follow the lead of so many other presidents before him to be a healer and chief and not a fanner of the flame. Yesterday, we saw a most unfortunate situation where before the curfew, the time of the curfew occurred, peaceful demonstrators in front of… protestors in front of the White House were beaten. Some people came out and beat them so they could clear the area so the President could come out and go forward. What is that? That has no place and it’s time for us to do away with that. Thank you all very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-06-10,"I am with you. Hi, Joe.
Well, I guess he's not so brilliant. Look, without tariffs, we would be captive to every country, and we have been for many years. That's why we have an $800 billion trading deficit for years. We lose a fortune with virtually every country. They take advantage of us in every way possible, and the U.S. Chamber is right there with them, and I assume, and I'm a member of the U.S. Chamber -- maybe I'll have to rethink that, because when you look at it, the chamber is probably more for the companies and the people that are members than they are for our country.
Because without tariffs, we would be absolutely, outside of something that I won't even mention, we would be absolutely in a competitive disadvantage, the likes of which you've never seen. Now, people haven't used tariffs, but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you're the piggy bank, when you have all the money.
Everyone's trying to get our money, China -- and the China deal's going to work out you know why. Because of tariffs. Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don't want to pay the tariffs. And China will, in my opinion, based on a lot of facts and a lot of knowledge, China's going to make a deal because they're going to have to make a deal.
Well, I'm going to tell you that most people understand that the people having to do with borders and illegal immigration and immigration of any kind, they understand exactly what that is. But we purposely said we wouldn't mention it for a little while. It's going to be brought up because it has to be brought by their legislative body.
It's got to be taken to a vote. So we didn't bring it up, but most people know that answer, Joe. And it's another very powerful tool in addition to the very powerful tools we got. We had none of these tools -- or virtually none, or they were just being talked about. They've been talked about for 20 years with Mexico, until I said -- and it wasn't a threat.
I thought we would be receiving billions of dollars, frankly and you know what happens with tariffs, companies will move out of Mexico and they'll move out of china, and they'll come into the United States or other countries also. But in the case of Mexico, I say we'd get virtually 100% of the companies.
They make a product and they sell it into our country. We lose a tremendous amount of money every year with Mexico for years, we've lost over $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico and of course, then we get into the second problem we have with Mexico, which maybe frankly is the first, and that's drugs and drugs coming across the border.
So, we want to have very, very powerful borders, and you can't do it unless you have these deals with Mexico. And ""The New York Times"" wrote a story, like I already made the deal. It's nonsense. We talked about it for months and months and months, and they wouldn't get there, and we just said, hey, look, if you don't get there, we're just going to have to charge you hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and we would have been just fine, because what would have happened -- you know, all these babies, these -- I don't know if they can honestly believe it -- you got it, Joe.
I noticed you were just about 80% there. Not quite 100%, but you were 80% there. But what will happen is the companies will move into the United States, back where they came from. They took 30% of our automobile companies, of our carry companies. They moved into Mexico. All of the people got fired. They would all move back if they had to pay a 25% tax or tariff.
They would all move back. It's a very simple formula. Now, that would leave Mexico in an unbelievably bad position. We don't want that either. And I spoke with the President of Mexico. I get along with him very well, and we made this deal. But this is something the U.S. Has been trying to get for over 20 years with Mexico.
They've never been able to do it. As soon as I put tariffs on the table, it was done. It took two days.
Joe, he's protecting companies who are members -- he's got most of them --
He's not protecting our country. He's doing a very big disservice and frankly, I've never had support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because they know where I stand on these things. I don't need money. I don't care how things are. The only thing I care about is our country. And he's protecting all of those companies that are members that like it just the way they are.
And they have companies in Mexico and they have companies in China. I mean, if you look at what General Motors did, they moved so much into China. Well, they can't be happy about paying tariffs like we're charging, 25% for cars. General Motors was charging 45%. If you look at what was going on, they built -- they built massive car factories, automobile plants in China.
So, what happened is China has a tariff for 45%. We have a tariff of basically zero. It's 2.5%, but basically it's zero. So, they sell us a car, it comes right into our country, no problem. We sell them a car, we have to pay 45%. It doesn't work that way, and it's not working that way anymore. And a lot of companies -- and I will say this -- companies and countries, but a lot of countries have changed their habits because they know they're next.
Without the power of tariffs by the richest, most successful country -- you know, we've picked up trillions of dollars in worth since I've been elected. China has lost many, many trillions of dollars. They're way behind. They were going to catch us. Had a democrat gotten in, namely, the one we're talking about, China would have caught us by the end of her term.
They're nowhere close. They'll never catch us. Not with what I'm doing. They'll never catch us.
Sure. I hear it all the time and I hear the other also. But I hear it all the time. And with Larry, in all fairness to Larry, they didn't let him finish his answer. He had further to go and nobody put that on. He put some of it on, but they didn't put it on the way that they should have. So, you know, that was a little bit of the media.
Look, it depends on what country you're talking about. If you're talking about China, it's different than Mexico. China will subsidize their product because they want to keep people working. So, China is going to pay a lot. We have put 25% on $250 billion of Chinese goods coming into our country, including $50 billion of high-technology equipment and things.
You haven't seen any, or virtually any price increase, because what China does -- it's basically their companies -- they subsidize their companies because they want to keep people working, they want to stay competitive. We have another $300 billion to go with China. I haven't done that because it's a very big thing for them, not for us. For us, it's not going to matter because we'll be able to buy the product in other countries that don't have the tariffs.
So it's not going to have an effect. With Mexico, what's going to happen is all the companies would immediately move into the United States. You'd have car plants going up all over our country, and there would be no tariff. So from my standpoint, it's a no-brainer, and it's only the Chamber of Commerce who's representing many of these companies, like General Motors I'm sure is a member, and most of these companies that we would talk about, they'd be members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Well, General Motors does not want to see us put a 25% tariff on China, and now they send their cars in before -- when they built those plants, there was no tariff. So they build a car in China and they send it into the United States. Same with Ford, same with others. Now with a 25% wall, those plants don't work anymore.
They made a bad investment. So, they're going to say, ""Oh, Trump's a bad guy, he doesn't know what he's doing about tariffs."" No, what's going to happen is they're going to have to come to the United States to build their plant. And the same with European Union at the right time, they're going to come in. They've been a very, very difficult negotiator.
I would say maybe more difficult than China in certain ways and nobody understands that.
A lot of it comes from Europe.
Totally.
Absolutely. They devalue their currency. They have for years. It's put them at a tremendous competitive advantage and we don't have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn't lower interest rates. We have a Fed that raises interest rates the day before a bond issue goes out, so we have to pay more money.
You tell me about that thinking, okay. We should be entitled to have a fair playing field, but even without a fair playing field -- because our Fed is very, very destructive to us -- even without a fair playing field, we're winning, because the tariffs are putting us at a tremendous competitive advantage --
People want our goods -- they want our money. We're the piggy bank. We're the bank.
No, they haven't listened to me. And you know, we have people -- it's more than just Jay Powell. We have people on the Fed that really weren't, you know, they're not my people, but they certainly didn't listen to me because they made a big mistake. They raised interest rates far too fast. That's number one.
Number two, they did quantitative tightening. They were taking in $50 billion a month, $50 billion a month and they've now eased that, but it's still $25 billion a month, which is ridiculous. Now, China's doing just the opposite. They're pumping money in. So, I'm not -- I'm winning, but I'm not winning on a level table.
If I had a table -- don't forget, the head of the Fed in China is President Xi. He's the president of China. He also is the head of the Fed. He can do whatever he wants. They devalue, they loosen, or you would just say they pump a lot of money into China, and it nullifies to an extent, not fully -- it nullifies the tariffs.
But I will say this, they're also devaluing their currency to a point. Makes it better up to a point. It's very hard for them to buy oil. Oil becomes very expensive. They have to buy a lot of things outside of China. So, that's where the devaluation is bad for them. But it's good for them in terms of selling product and it's good for them in terms of sort of negating to a certain extent the tariffs.
But with China, if we don't make a deal, you'll see a tariff increase of, you know, we have three -- they do $100 billion with us. We're doing close to $600 billion with them. So, we have the big, big advantage. Plus, we're the one that everybody is so used to taking advantage of as a country because we had, frankly, presidents that either didn't understand it or they were bored by it or they weren't smart enough to get what's going on. But those days are over, and we're doing great as a country.
We're doing -- but I just want to say to the United States Chamber of Commerce, if we didn't have tariffs, we wouldn't have made a deal with Mexico. We got everything we wanted. And we're going to be a great partner to Mexico now because now they respect us. They didn't even respect us. They couldn't believe how stupid we were with what's going on, where somebody comes in from Mexico and just walks right into our country and we're powerless to do anything.
Whereas they had very strong immigration laws. They don't have to take anybody. They can say, out, you get. So, we're going to be essentially using to a large extent the very powerful immigration laws of Mexico. And Mexico wants to do a good job. They're moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. Do you think they agreed to do that before?
And they're paying them. They're moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. That means the people from Guatemala, the people from Honduras and El Salvador, in theory, if they do it right, they're not going to be able to get through. Nobody's going to be able to get through. And then they're also going to protect our southern border.
So, it should have a big impact. Now, with all of that being said, the Democrats refuse to do anything on illegal immigration. They want open borders and they don't mind crime, they don't mind human trafficking, they don't mind drugs. You tell me if that's a good campaign issue, because i think they get clobbered on that issue.
Hi, Beck. I know Becky for a long time. Hi, Becky.
Yes, it would. And I think he will go and I think we are scheduled to have a meeting. I think he'll go. I have a great relationship with him. He's actually an incredible guy, a great man. He's very strong and very smart but he's for China and I am for the United States. It's a very simple -- it is a simple stat.
He's for China, I am for the U.S., so we are going to have our differences. But I think the differences can be worked out very easily. I would be surprised if he didn't go. I think he is going, I haven't heard that he's not. We are expected to meet. If we do, that's fine and if we don't, that's fine. Look, from our standpoint, the best deal we can have is 25% on $600 billion, okay?
And then those companies are going to move into other locations and they are going to send -- and there won't be a tariff. You know, our business people in this country are very sophisticated. They are very good. If a product goes up in price, they go to Vietnam or they go to one of many other countries or they make the product in the United States, which is my favorite.
But that's what will happen. No, if we don't have a deal -- if we don't make a deal, then we will be raising the tariffs, meaning putting the tariffs on more than -- you know, we've only taxed 35% to 40% of what they send in. They have another 60% and that'll be taxed absolutely.
Well, I can tell you they discriminate against me. You know, people talk about collusion. The real conclusion is between the Democrats and these companies. Because they were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, 'If you don't have them, you can't win.' Well, I won, you know, and I'll win again because we are doing well.
We are not fools anymore. We are not the foolish country that does so badly. You look at India, a very good friend of mine, Prime Minister Modi, you take a look at what they have done, 100% tax on a motorcycle. We charge them nothing. So, when Harley sends it over there, they have 100% tax. When they send it, they make a tremendous number of motorcycles.
When they send them, no tax. I called him. I said it's unacceptable. He reduced it by 50% with one phone call. I said it's still unacceptable because it is 50% verses nothing. It's still unacceptable. And they're working on it. But if I didn't -- if we did not have the power of what we have, and if we weren't the bank -- well, if we weren't the bank, we wouldn't even be talking about it because nobody would care.
But we're the bank that everybody wants to rob. And that's what they've been doing for a long period of time. $800 billion we have in trade deficits with other countries. So, you tell me who made those deals.
Well, I am the one -- I'm a budget cutter and I have cut the budget. But on defense, I don't want to do any cutting. Because President Obama, and President Bush -- you know, he was fighting the wars in the Middle East -- I was left a very depleted military. And I feel just the opposite. I am very much of a cost cutter.
I want to have a great budget. But before a budget, I have to have a great military. So, as long as I am here, we are going to have a great military and they're not going to have to worry. We've rebuilt, we've ordered many F-35s, we've ordered ships and planes and missiles and we are ordering the best stuff in the world.
Plus, I am a sales man for the country. I'm getting other country to buy tremendous amount of our military. You know, you could ask any of the folks run our military companies --the different companies what they are doing because of me. I get nothing. I'm sitting there in the oval office, saying, 'You've got to buy our helicopters.
If you don't, we are not going to be happy with you,' and they end up going out to buy our helicopters and our F-35s. Look at how many F-35s Japan and other companies are buying. So, you know, it's good as long as I'm there. I am a little concerned about United Technologies and Raytheon because one of the things that I bring up all of the time, we used to have many plane companies.
We used to have many, many. They've all merged. Now we have very few. We have the two main ones, as you know, and you have Lockheed and Boeing and you have a little bit some others, just a little bit. But they're all merged in, so it is hard to negotiate when you have two companies and sometimes you get one bid.
When we had 10 and 12 companies, now that may not be sustainable because they all go bust. And so, that's the purpose of what they did. But never the less, I can tell you because I get involved in negotiations. I got the plane cost down a lot. So, when I hear United Technologies, which is a great company, I know it well because I bought many an Otis Elevator over my lifetime.
It is a great company but when I hear United, and I bought a lot of carrier too, by the way -- when I hear United and when I hear Raytheon, which is another incredible company, the missile systems they make are incredible, when I hear they're merging, does that take away more competition? It becomes one big fat, beautiful company.
But I have to negotiate. Meaning the United States has to buy things and does that make it less competitive? Because it is already so very less -- it's already not competitive. You look at the budgets of other major countries: take a look at Russia, they spend $68 billion a year on military. Take a look at China, they're $200-$250 billion a year.
Well, we are many times that. And part of it because we spend so much money and part of it is we have no competition. We really don't. We don't have competition.
Well, there's something going on, Joe. And I will tell you this: the European Union, which is a fantastic group of negotiators, actually a very, very prominent person who you know well, who's on your show a lot, said the person at the European Union that's in charge of taxation hates the United States more than any person anywhere in the world.
And I really believe that's true. Every week you see them going after Facebook and Apple and all of these companies, that are, you know, great companies but something is going on. But I will say the European Union is suing them all the time. We are going to be looking at them differently. We have a great Attorney General, we are going to look at it differently.
When they give European Union $7 billion and $5 billion and $2 billion, and you know, Apple gets sued for $10 billion. And you know, right now, it is going on but they'll end up settling. They get all this money. We should be doing that -- they're our companies, so they're actually attacking our companies.
But we should be doing what they're doing. They think there is a monopoly. But I am not sure if they think that. They just figure this is easy money, we'll sue Apple for $7 billion and we'll make a settlement or we'll win the case. So, I think it is a bad situation. But, obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.
Well, only if they have the same products. They have some overlap, from what I understand. But only if they have the same products. That would be the thing that bothers me most. I mean, I can tell you from the airplanes, you want to buy a plane and you will have one bid. You don't have the people that make them.
The companies that make them are incredible. They make them incredibly and they are great companies. But you don't have any competition. It is crazy. We have given up making like the F-22 fighter jets and that was a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing. It was the greatest fighter jet, in my opinion, it was the greatest ever.
And we gave it up because it was costing so much. You have the two companies in a joint venture, and from what I hear, I wasn't here then, that was a while ago, but from what I hear, you could not negotiate with them. This is what we want them, and the government says we'll take it. Okay. So, I just want to see competition, the two great companies, I love them both.
But I want to see that we don't hurt our competition.
Well, I do see it as a threat. At the same time, it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiations with China. China very much wants to make a deal. They want to make a deal much more than I do. But we'll see what happens. Look, I don't mind taking in billion of dollars.
You know, the 3.2 we had in the first quarter, a lot of people said we picked up one point because of all the tariffs that we are taking in from China. Just remember, they're charging us tariffs. You know, some of the folks that I really like but some of the senators come to me, 'Well sir, it's not really good because it is not free market.' Like, you take India where they are charging 100% -- and by the way 100% is nothing compares to what some companies charge.
You know, France charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for French wine. So the wineries come to me and they say -- the California guys, they come to me: Sir, we are paying a lot of money to put our products into France and you're letting -- meaning, this country is allowing this French wine which is great, we have great wine, too, allowing it to come in for nothing.
It is not fair. And you know what, it's not fair. We'll do something about it.
I made a priority for 5G, before I got here, we were way behind. Now we are actually going to be leading very shortly. We are leading in everything. We are -- if you look at China, China, as great as they are and they are great, they are near the capability of our geniuses in Silicon Valley that walk around in under shirts and they were not $2 billion a piece.
Okay. They don't have nearly the genius these people have. And they practically admit it. They don't want to exactly and say that. They try to go out and buy the company. Now we have restrictions on that, too, which we put in under my administration very recently. Because they were buying all of our companies.
They could not do it. But we have the most brilliant people. We have the most brilliant. Huawei is very powerful and very strong, don't forget ZTE, I did something with them where I closed them up and they paid me -- they paid us as a country, $1.2 billion fee and we changed their board, changed their management, we allowed them to open, but ZTE is a much smaller -- that was $1.2 billion done in one week.
That was you know a good deal. And you know I don't want to put their companies out of business. I want China to do well. I don't want them to do as well as us, I have to be honest with you. You know when they say China, 25 years, you don't see them anymore. It says China 25. And what they mean is that in 25 they're going to be much bigger and they're going to be dominant in 25. I told President Xi, listen, that's very insulting to me. Can't do that.
They took it off -- they don't use China 25 anymore because he understood exactly what we meant. Look, I said it before, we picked up $10 trillion more than that in value. And they've lost $15 to $20 trillion in value since the day I was elected. We are doing great. I hope the Raytheon deal -- I hope it can happen.
But I don't want to see where we have one less person that can compete for an order. I don't want to see that. It's no good. And as far as the U.S. Chambers of Commerce, they have to start representing the United States and not just the companies that are members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Thank you Joe. And thank you Becky. Thank you very much.
",Interview: Donald Trump Dials In to CNBC's 'Squawk Box' for a Phone Interview,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-cnbc-kernen-quick-june-10-2019
Matt Warman,United Kingdom,2020-01-30,"I thank my hon. I know he has a deep interest in this issue, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has corresponded with him about it over the past few months. She will address this issue herself in the other place later today.
New telecoms technologies and next-generation networks like 5G and full fibre can change our lives for the better. They can give us the freedom to live and work more freely, help rural communities to develop thriving digital economies, and help socially isolated people to maintain relationships, so the security and resilience of the UK’s telecoms networks is of paramount importance. The UK has one of the world’s most dynamic digital economies, and we welcome open trade and inward investment. However, our economy can prosper and unleash Britain’s potential only when we and our international partners are assured that our critical national infrastructure remains safe and secure.
As part of our mission to provide world-class digital connectivity, including 5G, my Department carried out a cross-Whitehall evidence-based review of the telecoms supply chain to ensure a diverse and secure supply base. That review’s findings were published in July 2019 and set out the Government’s priorities for the future of our telecommunications. Those priorities are strong cyber-security across the entire telecommunications sector, greater resilience in telecommunications networks and diversity across the entire 5G supply chain. It considered the UK’s entire market position, including economic prosperity, the industry and consumer effects, and the quality, resilience and security of equipment.
However, in July, the review did not take a decision on the controls to be placed on high-risk vendors in the UK’s telecoms network. Despite the inevitable focus on Huawei, that review was not about one company or even one country. We would never take a decision that threatens our national security or the security of our allies. The Government’s telecoms supply chain review is a thorough review into a complex area that made use of the best available expert advice and evidence, and its conclusions on high-risk vendors will be reported once ministerial decisions have been taken.
The National Security Council will meet tomorrow to discuss these issues. This work is an important step in strengthening the UK’s security frameworks for telecoms and ensuring the roll-out of 5G and full-fibre networks. I know that Members on both sides of the House feel strongly about this issue, and the Government will make a statement to the House to communicate final decisions on high-risk vendors at the appropriate time. We will always put national security at the top of our agenda.
",2020 Statement on Huawei,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/matt-warman-2020-statement-on-huawei/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-09-12,"Thank you very much.
It is a great honor and I am very, very grateful being here today in front of so many distinguished people. I've met more generals than I've ever seen in my life.
I like them and they like me. A lost endorsements, I can tell you. My special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett and to each and everyone of you. Thank you very much.
Thank you, guys.
The National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people. Our debt to you is eternal. Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery, and these are serious, serious bad days for our country, the recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City -- and I was there and I know what you went through.
Since 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas, including those with multiple deployments. Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries all across the world and doing an unbelievable job.
Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life, working every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states and answer the call of duty for their country. I am given the honor to serve as your president, which I think will happen, and we're going to soon find out.
We hope. And if it does happen, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment and the support you need and deserve, and that you're not getting.
You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House. Whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down. I am running to be a president for all Americans, and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.
All Americans, you know what I mean. All across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers and also our firefighters and paramedics. These are incredible people. They embody the goodness and decency of our country.
I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear, demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the millions. Our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old and millions of working class families who just want a better future and a good job. These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized.
These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. Nobody's heard anything like this. She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book; she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic. She called half of our supporters a basket of deplorable in both the speech and in interview. She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.
Hillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fund-raisers on Wall Street. She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh, you heard them; they were all laughing. Good, good solid laugh. They were laughing at the very people who paved the roads -- I mean, and these are the roads that she with all of her security, drive on -- paint the buildings she speaks in, and importantly, all of the other functions.
I mean, if you think all functions in life, including this auditorium and its maintenance.
Hillary Clinton is an insider supported by powerful insiders attacking Americans who have absolutely no political power. Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run. She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes and scratch out a living for their family; a hard-earned living, too.
While Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.
After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts -- that was her true thoughts. She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her rule. She views it as her rule.
It's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disaster she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya. To this day, she won't take accountability for her role in unleashing -- and that's what happened -- unleashing ISIS across the Middle East or for putting Iran on a path to nuclear weapons. And as far as ISIS is concerned, probably unleashing ISIS here.
We better be very, very smart, tough and vigilant or we're going to have big problems. Hillary Clinton believes she's above the law, that she is above accountability and that she is above each and every one of you.
Our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country. And they have been forgotten. I'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.
I am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors and the corrupt political insiders. And of course, never forget, the special interests. I am running to be your voice.
Hillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for top -- really the top ten percent and really the top one percent, and even less than that. Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign and paying for her speeches tremendous amounts of money. And you know who she will be representing if she ever won, which I don't believe is going to happen.
In fact, if you look at the recent polls, the ones over the last few days, we're doing very well, that I can tell you.
The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed toward millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service. You cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter, and she does. You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion for its citizens.
Hillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all. She's doubled down on her campaign conspiracy and contempt. If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don't see how she can credibly campaign any further.
Let's be clear. These were not off-hand comments from Hillary Clinton. They were given also in an interview and probably a number of interviews. These were lengthy, planned and prepared remarks. It was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major party presidential nominee. Total disrespect for the people of our country.
Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic playbook, smearing someone with one of the names, you know, those names in order -- really, in order to scare -- and I mean try and seriously scare them out of voting for change.
And we're bringing change. She can't bring change. She's been doing this for 35 years. She now talks about change. There's no change. It's going to be more of the same, only worse. It's going to be four more years of Barack Obama, only worse. She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people. She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.
And there will be reform. There has to be reform. People who want their immigration laws enforced -- we have no choice, we have to do that -- and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected. People who warn about radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes. They're not. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.
People who support police and who want crime reduced and stopped are not prejudiced and are not bad people.
They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost and oftentimes killed to preventable violence, and it is preventable.
Hillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about sanctuary cities or jobs moving overseas where so many are moving. She's protected from her own policies. The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities. Our inner cities are a disaster.
Our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.
We are the campaign of school choice. We are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African American and Hispanic worker. And we are doing amazingly well with African American and Hispanic workers, you've been seeing that over the last week.
We are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people. This change agenda includes a new foreign and new military policy. We are going to put the failed policy of the past, and there are many, behind us. Ideally, way behind us.
We will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do, and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.
Thank you. Instead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.
We will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States. America first, remember that. America first.
My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military and the elimination of the defense -- and we have to do this so quickly, it's a disaster -- of the defense sequester. It is a disaster.
Have no choice, it is a disaster. It's called depletion. We have been depleted as a military, we can't let that happen. The greatest men and women on Earth, but we have been depleted by what's taken place. In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best modern, state-of-the-art equipment in the world, bar none.
The National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people. You were there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike, always amazes me the courage, the care, the love that you give, amazing. And the danger is beyond belief.
You were there to protect civilians in times of unrest, you were there to respond to every natural disaster. You deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done and to get the job done right.
In a Trump administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office, and I mean direct.
You will have an administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day. You will have a president who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every single turn.
The incredible members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country. We will never forget our heroes, their families and the ones they've left behind. Our gratitude is and will be everlasting. We will protect those who protect us and we will follow your example of unity working in common purpose and for a common cause. We will be one people under one God saluting one American flag.
We will rebuild our military and our country. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we together will make America great again. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, everybody.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-04-05,"Okay, thank you very much, everybody. All these people have been working very, very hard today, I'll tell you. For a long time, they've been working.
But before I begin, I want to express our nation's well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus. All Americans are praying for him. He's a friend of mine. He's a great gentleman and a great leader. And he's -- as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I'm hopeful and sure that he's going to be fine. He's a strong man, a strong person.
Today, every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey. They've really become a very hot zone, but some very good things are happening. In New York, the first time where the deaths were less from the previous day. That's the first drop so far. So maybe that's a good sign; it could be. And the hospital levels are starting to perhaps decrease. It's been very short, but perhaps decrease.
So we wish Governor Cuomo and all of the people in New York great. And, New Jersey, your governor is doing a great job. He's doing a great job in New Jersey. They got hit very hard.
I just want to say that the full power of the American government and American enterprise -- it really is. This is an all-out military operation that we've waged, and especially over the last number of weeks. Fifty states and territories have now been approved for major disaster declarations, which is very unusual.
Thanks to the Army Corps of Engineers, New York City's Javits Center is now one of the largest hospitals in the United States. It's designated for treatment of the virus patients and staffed by hundreds of federal medical personnel deployed from two Army hospital units, and they're doing a great job. This was something that we didn't expect to do, but they needed help in New York and we sent federal troops -- not only troops, we also sent a lot of very talented doctors, nurses, first responders. People are now running Javits.
Also, as you know, the USNS Comfort, which is in New York -- there's been a lot of publicity about that coming in and all. That was not supposed to be for the virus at all, under any circumstances. But it looks like, more and more, we're going to be using it for that. So we'll see. That was supposed to be for people having other medical problems, but it's very interesting because there are virtually no cars on the road, no motorcycles on the road, no -- no anything on the road. Things that would normally be taken care of, we don't see anymore. So we haven't seen that in a long time. It's, perhaps, a positive.
But the ship is ready. And if it has to, if we need it -- if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that. They'd prefer not, for obvious reasons, but if for any reason they need it, it's ready, willing, and able.
We have the best doctors, the best military leaders, and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world. And we're orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done. We've never done anything like this. And, more and more, we're using our medical people because of the fact that jurisdictions, states -- in particular New York, New Jersey, the Connecticut area. Long Island now has become a hotspot -- part of New York. We're sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, and now we're sending personnel where it's needed. Military personnel.
As of Tuesday, we'll have deployed over 3,000 military and public health professionals to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and other parts of our country -- 3,000 -- and that number is going up. And we hope we're seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all. So we'll see. You'll be seeing that over the next few days. Let's see what happens. But we're prepared.
In the last seven days, FEMA has airlifted critical supplies and protective equipment from every corner of Earth. They're coming from all over the planet, including from within the United States, where the equipment isn't as necessary.
Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost -- listen to this -- 300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks, and 3 million gowns. And many more fully loaded cargo planes are right now on the way. Three big ones landed today. And these supplies are being distributed directly to the hospitals and healthcare providers all across the nation so that that massive amount of material that we're getting in is being delivered all over the country.
Tomorrow, we'll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system. It was requested -- Mayor de Blasio. We've been working great with Mayor de Blasio, getting him a lot of stuff. He's working very hard; I can tell you that. And we're working, really, very hard with New York City and with New York State.
And at the request of Congressman Lee Zeldin, out in Long Island, we will also be delivering another 200,000 N95 masks to Suffolk County, where they need it very badly. So we're getting that out on an emergency basis. It should be there tomorrow.
We'll also be deploying millions of N95 masks to other locations that Admiral Polowczyk will detail shortly. The Admiral will be up in just a couple of minutes.
Over the last 24 hours, FEMA has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey. Five hundred. And again, the governor has been very thankful. We're working very hard with New Jersey, including building hospitals.
We've also sent an additional 200 ventilators to Louisiana -- a definite hotspot. Three hundred to Michigan -- working very well, I think, with the governor.
Amazingly, 600 will be going or have gone to Illinois. And, I mean, there's a governor -- I hear him complaining all the time -- Pritzker. I hear him; he's always complaining. And yet, I just said, ""Give me a list of a couple of the things we've done in Illinois."" And we're building a 2,500-bed hospital in McCormick Place; that's the big convention center in Chicago. And we're helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he's not able to do what you're supposed to be able to do as a governor. He has not performed well.
And we're also sending 100 ventilators to Massachusetts.
So we have 600 to Illinois. We have 100 to Massachusetts. We have 300 to Michigan. We have 200 to Louisiana. We have 500 ventilators -- 500 -- going to New Jersey. And this is being done by FEMA. It's being delivered by FEMA. And it's -- that's some job. Just think of that. When you think about 500 ventilators, a ventilator is a big deal.
We're also establishing a federal medical station in the Washington, D.C., area to help Washington, D.C., and working very closely with the mayor and everybody in Washington, D.C.
At the same time, Governor Inslee -- we appreciate this -- of Washington State has returned 400 ventilators, which can now be deployed elsewhere in our country. So the State of Washington has done very well. They won't be needing some of the ventilators that have been sent -- about 400. That's a lot. And we appreciate that he's able to give them back. He feels confident that they are in good shape for the coming weeks, until we can declare a final victory.
In the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic. Our warriors in this life-and-death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare workers on the frontline of the fight. We pledge to them our eternal gratitude and everlasting support. They make all of us very proud. Our country is very proud. We have people -- they love our country. The world loves our country, most of it. Probably all of it; they just don't say it.
I can report today that the United States has now tested and given results -- gotten results of 1.67 million people. That's far more than any other country has been able to do. And you remember, we inherited a broken system. So a lot of this has been developed.
By Tuesday, 1,200 brand-new rapid point-of-care testing kits has been produced by Abbott Laboratories. A great company. And they'll be distributed to all of our public health labs -- that's a 15-minute test; even less -- as well as the Indian Health Service, the CDC, and the Strategic National Stockpile.
So we're going to have 1,200. And on a weekly basis, we're making a lot more. They go very fast. They're very accurate tests. And other countries are wanting them. So, at the right time, we'll be able to do that. But right now, we're getting them to all of ours.
So we've done 1,670,000 tests. Think of that: 1,670,000 tests. And we have a great system now. We're working with the states in almost all instances, but we have a great system.
And the other thing that we bought a tremendous amount of is the hydroxychloroquine -- hydroxychloroquine -- which I think -- as you know, it's a great malaria drug. It's worked unbelievably. It's this powerful drug on malaria. And there are signs that it works on this. Some very strong signs. And, in the meantime, it's been around a long time. It also works very powerfully on lupus. Lupus.
So there are some very strong, powerful signs, and we'll have to see. Because again, it's being tested now. This is a new thing that just happened to us -- the ""invisible enemy,"" we call it.
. But as a combination, I think they're going to be -- I think they're two things that should be looked at very strongly.
Now, we have purchased and we have stockpiled 29 million pills of the hydroxychloroquine -- 29 million. A lot of drugstores have them by prescription, and also -- and they're not expensive. Also, we're sending them to various labs, our military. We're sending them to the hospitals. We're sending them all over.
I just think it's something -- you know the expression, I've used it for certain reasons: ""What do you have to lose?"" What do you have to lose? And a lot of people are saying that when -- and are taking it -- if you're a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good. But what do you have to lose? They say, ""Take it.""
I'm not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. But we have some very good signs. So that's hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
And, again, you have to go through your medical people, get the approval. But I've seen things that I sort of like. So what do I know? I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. But I have common sense. The FDA feels good about it. They've -- as you know, they've approved it. They gave it a rapid approval. And the reason: because it's been out there for a long time and they know the side effects and they also know the potential. So, based on that, we have sent it throughout the country and we have it stockpiled -- about 29 million doses. Twenty-nine million doses. We have a lot of it. We hope it works.
Driven by the goal of the brightest minds in science -- we have the brightest minds in science, but we're driven by the goal of getting rid of this plague, getting rid of this scourge, getting rid of this virus. These brilliant minds are working on the most effective antiviral therapies and vaccines. We are working very, very hard. I have met many of the doctors that are doing it. These are doctors that are working so hard on vanquishing the virus.
They're staying -- we strongly recommend staying at home, practicing vigorous hygiene, and maintaining social distance, so you're -- you're just not going to catch it. It's the most effective weapon in this war.
And I will tell you, the -- we are committing to the -- to you. We're committing to the people of our country like few administrations, few people, few professionals have ever committed before. They are -- they are working so hard. I see them. I see them before my eyes, exhausted -- people that I'm dealing with every day, exhausted. They haven't left their offices. They haven't left their hospitals. We meet with them. We see them.
And tremendous strides have been made. I think the vaccines -- we'll have a report on that. But the vaccines -- we're working together with other countries. We're also working with other countries -- many other countries. And we all want everyone else to be first. We're very happy. But we are very far down the line on vaccines. We'll see how that all works. Johnson & Johnson is doing a great job, working very hard. A vaccine would be great. Therapy -- a therapy and therapeutics would be great. We'll see what happens. In the meantime, you may listen to what I said about the two drugs mentioned.
My administration is rapidly implementing the largest emergency economic relief package in American history. You've seen what's been happening. Billions of dollars in small- business loans have already been processed through Paycheck Protection Programs.
So we went out on Friday and, literally, it's become so popular. It's been worked with the banks. They get it to the small business. It's all about employment. It's all about jobs. We want you to keep your jobs. It gives small business funding to keep the workers on the payroll. And we're sending direct cash payments to millions of Americans and rushing aid to the hardest-hit industries. We're saving industries. We will be -- you'll be seeing it. And if we do more, we're going to do more, and we're going to try and get directly to people that are hit so hard.
But we're going to take care of our workers. We're going to take care of our citizens. We're going to take care of our small businesses. We're going to take care of our large businesses: the airplane industry, the -- the airline industry. A lot of great industries that we have that are in trouble because of what took place over the last short period of time.
These are industries that were doing better -- for the most part, doing better than ever. The airlines were doing great. Oil was doing great -- oil and gas. And the energy industry was doing phenomenally well, and it got hit like nobody has ever been hit before. Just about like no industry has ever been hit before. There's never been anything like this.
But we see light at the end of the tunnel. Things are happening. Things are happening. We're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. And hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we'll be very proud of the job we all did. We can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we're going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum -- the least it could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus.
In closing, I also want to note today is Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week for Christians in America and all around the world. While we may be apart from one another, as you can see from our great churches, our great pastors and ministers are out there working very hard. But we may be apart -- we can use this time to turn to reflection and prayer and our own personal relationship with God.
I would ask that all Americans pray for the heroic doctors and nurses, for the truck drivers and grocery store workers, and for everyone fighting this battle. I had mentioned yesterday, where I see the nurses rushing into hospitals, and they're putting on their outfits, and they're putting on their masks and goggles, in some cases. They're rushing into war. They're rushing into war.
And I see people from apartment houses screaming and shouting and singing their praises. It's an incredible thing. They're warriors -- these doctors and nurses. They're running into buildings, and they're literally putting it on as the doors are opening. They're putting all their stuff and running inside. And they're running inside to tremendous danger. Tremendous danger.
But, most of all, I'd like to ask for your prayers for the families who have lost loved ones. Ask God to comfort them in their hour of grief. It's a great hour of grief for our nation, for the world.
This morning -- I was talking 151. For four days, I said 151. A hundred and fifty-one countries. This morning, it's 182 countries. It jumped up a lot. So, as of this morning, it's 182 countries are under attack from this monster.
With the faith of our families and the spirit of our people, and the grace of our God, we will endure, we will overcome, we will prevail. We have learned so much. We will be stronger than ever.
And I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank the incredible professionals on the task force also. We had a big meeting today. We -- were calls all day long to so many different people. And I think our package to get everyone working when we're ready is really turning out to be successful. We may have to make it larger because it's been really successful. But all of that comes back to this country. We want to get them back. We want to get our people back to work. Everybody wants to be back. We want to open up our country as soon as possible.
So, with that, I'm going to ask Dr. Birx to say a few words, and she's got some charts to show you. And thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Admiral? Please.
Hydroxy.
Great job. Thank you very much, Admiral. Mike, please.
Oh, good.
Good.
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you.
Mike?
Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you.
Go ahead. Yeah.
They do get orders for a lot more than sometimes we think an area needs. Generally speaking, we like to either negotiate that down or give it to them as they want.
So we've had a lot of orders that we think are high, but we generally like, if we have it -- if we have, for instance, with the medicines and with other things, we like to give it to them.
Every day, we're building up and building it up very rapidly, and deploying it. But we do get orders from some of the states where we don't think they need it. We try and get it for them what they want anyway.
Okay? Go ahead.
Yes.
I didn't speak to him, no. I did get a call from the ambassador. And, hey, it's a big -- it's a big move, going to the hospital. That's a big thing.
He's a great gentleman, so I -- you know, I just hope he's okay.
Yes.
Well, we're talking about it, and we're talking about doing something for them. But we're really looking at the conclusion. We want to just -- we don't want to focus on that now. They're incredible. There's -- they're not saying, ""We're not doing it."" They go in with good equipment, with great equipment, and with stuff that's not so good. And sometimes they catch it wearing the best stuff you can buy -- brand new, the best stuff.
This is a very tough enemy. But these are amazing people. No, we are talking about something, but we're really thinking about, let's get it finished first before we do that.
Please.
A tough -- tough week.
I don't think they're so different. I think we all know that we have to reach a certain point, and that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death. But it's also a point at which things are going to start changing.
We're getting very close to that level right now. And the next week and a half, two weeks are going to be -- I think they're going to be very difficult.
At the same time, we understand what they represent and what that time represents, and hopefully we can get this over with because this is a very horrible thing for the world. Hey, look, we're one country out of 182 now that have -- 182 countries.
I have a friend of mine -- said he didn't know we had so many countries in the world. A hundred and eighty-two countries are now affected by this. So we want to get it over with. Okay?
Please.
Yes.
Well, we hope we can stay under those numbers. Those are numbers of death. And we hope we can stay under those numbers. That would be terrific. And as far under those numbers as possible.
Now, if we did nothing, you know that number too. But the American people really stepped up; so did the professionals. They just really stepped up. So we're hoping to stay under those numbers.
And that means the minimum and the maximum, but we're hoping to stay under the minimum number. You know what that number was.
I would say the answer is ""yes,"" but I would also say that we're not going to know really in terms of a final toll until we get out to the end. And we're probably, possibly, not so far away. We're getting closer. But it's our goal to stay as far under that minimum number -- the minimum number as possible. Okay? That's what we want to do.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Because I want people to live and I'm seeing people dying. And I see people that are going to die without it. And you know the expression. When that's happening, they should do it. What really do we have to lose?
We also have -- this medicine has been tested for many years for malaria and for lupus, so it's been out there. So it's a very strong, powerful medicine, but it doesn't kill people. We have some very good results and some very good tests. You've seen the same test that I have.
In France, they had a very good test; they're continuing. But we don't have time to go and say, ""Gee, let's take a couple of years and test it out. And let's go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories."" We don't have time. I'd love to do that. But we have people dying today. As we speak, there are people dying. If it works, that would be great. If it doesn't work -- we know, for many years, malaria, it -- it's incredible what it's done for malaria; it's incredible what it's done for lupus. But it doesn't kill people.
That's one of the things with a vaccine. When we have a vaccine, we have to do tests because when you inject that vaccine, when they take whatever ever it is they have to take, we have to make sure it doesn't have a horrible impact, destroy somebody. Good? So we have to test it for a long period of time. This one, not so much because it's been out there.
Now, I'm not acting as a doctor. I'm saying, ""Do what you want, but there are some good signs."" You've read the signs, I've read the signs. With the other one, there's some very good signs also. Different -- going together works very well. But there may be an indication that if you have a problem with your heart, you shouldn't take what we call the Z-Pak. You shouldn't take it, and that's okay.
But I would love to go to a laboratory and spend a couple of years testing something. We don't have time. We don't have two hours, because there are people dying right now. If it does help, great. If it doesn't help, we gave it a shot. We gave it a shot. That's the way I feel.
You know, we passed something -- yeah, I would -- I would be very serious about taking it.
We passed something that I'm very proud of. It's called Right to Try. For 45, 50 years, they've been trying. It makes so much sense. We have the greatest doctors and labs and lab technicians, the greatest medicines, the greatest minds in the world. Everybody admits it. And when we're close to having something, or when we have something that tests incredibly well, you couldn't use it for years because they would take years and years to test.
So with the help of also Democrats -- I got it bipartisan, but they've been trying to get this passed for -- for decades. You know that. It's called Right to Try. So a person would be diagnosed terminally ill from something. And in the old days, meaning before a year ago, they would say, ""Do you think I could try this -- this pill, this whatever, this medicine that's testing so well?"" ""No, you can't do that. You can't do that under no circumstances."" They'd leave for Asia, they'd leave for Europe, they'd leave for -- if they had money. If they had no money, they'd go home and die with no hope.
We got a thing called Right to Try. If somebody is very ill, terminally ill, they're going to die. They -- and it was very complex. It wasn't as easy as it sounds because there were huge liability problems. The drug companies didn't want to do it because they didn't want it on test results -- because these are very sick people, so they didn't want to bring down their test results. The insurance companies had tremendous problems.
I got everybody in the room, I said, ""Look, we'll sign a waiver."" The person taking it will say, ""We're not going to sue."" The family is not going to sue the drug company, not going to sue the insurance company, not going to sue the state, the city, or the federal government. Okay? It's called ""exculpation."" And we got it done. It's a very simple agreement. I don't know why nobody ever thought of it, but they never thought of it. I did. And we got it done.
Now we have Right to Try, which is actually, in my opinion, much more difficult than what we're talking about here. But if there's a medicine or something, a possible cure, or something that's looking good and somebody has something that's going -- they're going to die or they're very sick, they take it. And, you know, we've had some unbelievable results. Unbelievable results. And it also gives the people hope.
Yes, please.
That's true. And many of them do.
Sure.
Sure.
They should be finished in about a year.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just saying --
-- very simply. I'm not at all. I'm not.
Look, you know what I'm trying to do? I'm trying to save lives.
I want them to try it. And it may work, and it may not work. But if it doesn't work, it's nothing lost by doing it. Nothing.
Because we know -- long term, what I want, I want to save lives. And I don't want it to be in a lab for the next year and a half as people are dying all over the place.
That's right.
All I'm doing is saying -- well, I'll tell you what I accomplish. We bought massive amounts of it -- 29 million doses of it. We have it coming from all of the labs. We're actually now doing it here, because in case it does work, we want to have it. And we've given it to drugstores, we're -- we're sending it all over. FEMA is doing it. FEMA is doing it. We're doing it through different channels, many different channels, including the companies that make it.
It's a very special thing. Now, it may not work, in which case, hey, it didn't work. And it may work, in which case, it's going to save a lot of lives. Now, a lot of people say, if the people walking in prior to getting it, if they take it, it has a profound effect. Well, maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.
I don't want to wait a year and a half to find out.
And only CNN would ask that question. Fake news.
Go ahead.
A bunch of fakers.
I also think that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx are very impressed with the American people. And I'm not going to put words in anybody's mouth -- I would never do that -- but I am, and I will say that they are doing maybe a better job than we all thought even possible.
When you look at streets in New York where there's nobody in the street, no cars, no nothing -- I see it. You know, I've seen those streets for a long time and they're packed all the time. And now you see there's nobody. You look at other places; you look at what's going on in California where they're doing a fantastic job. They really are. The governor is doing great. I'm proud of them. I'm proud of a lot of people -- proud of a lot of people on the other side. You know, of a lot of people.
Really -- I'm really delighted to work with people that, frankly, on other issues, I didn't get along so well with. We disagree on this or that; we don't have to go into that now. But we're getting along with a lot of people. And they're happy with us. We're happy with them.
But I really believe that the American people are doing a better job than anybody would have thought even possible, and that's one of the reasons we can even be talking about the kind of number that we hopefully will be talking about, which is at the minimum level instead of the maximum or beyond. It's not even the maximum -- it's much beyond a maximum level, which would be horrific.
Yes, please.
Please.
Well, it was voluntary, as I saw it yesterday. And certainly, if they'd want to, I would -- I would encourage it. I would have absolutely no problem with that if they wanted.
We had a long meeting today. There's good separation. But the task force meets and I would certainly have absolutely no problem if they wanted to. I think, frankly, it's something, at least for a period of time, where it might be advisable. And you know, it's advisory. And we'll see what happens.
Yes, please.
Not here. No, not here. No, no, no --
Well, no, you've seen in Spain and you've seen in different -- they're not sending faulty things to us.
No, we test it. We look at it. We check it out.
Please.
And we're also sending it to other -- from other locations.
And when it comes to the ventilators, which are very complex, we are now building -- we have now, under construction, literally thousands of ventilators. So -- but so far, I think our projections on ventilators have been right. They've been correct.
Did you have something? For who?
Well, it's turning out that we need less hospital beds.
That's what you're talking about. And that's what we -- well, we may have models, but we've been sort of saying that. In New York, we were saying we think you're going to need less. Now, let's hope that continues. But right now -- I heard Governor Cuomo this morning, and he was saying less hospital beds, also less death. That was a very big thing.
First time -- less death today than yesterday, right? That's a big thing. But also less hospital beds. That means less patients because basically it's less patients. And we were saying that. And it also means less ventilators. So there's a lot of -- a lot of very positive things happening.
Okay. Please.
Yes.
We have -- we have this tiny platform and I'd love it to be wider. You're staying away from each other.
Mike, you were tested?
Okay. Like recently. So was I, a couple of days ago.
We are. We are. We are. You know, here we are on this platform. And -- but I get next to him, I don't breathe. I'm only kidding. We are -- we are sometimes forced into positions that I'd rather -- I'd rather be away, but it's -- you know, you're all looking for questions. Mike is a very big part of this; I am. It's very difficult maintaining like, this distance on this little area.
Well, if the oil price stays the way it is because of people that really want to see it go up -- when I say get -- we want to save a great industry. We built a great industry in this country. If they don't get along, I would do that. Yeah, I would do tariffs, very substantial tariffs. Because we're independent now; we have our own oil.
And if I did the tariffs, we essentially would be saying,
We don't want foreign oil. We don't want any foreign oil. We're just going to use our oil. And that would help to save an industry. And, you know, it's become a tremendous job producer. And it's great to be independent. We're independent. Our energy is now independent. We produce more oil than -- oil and gas than anybody else, than any other country. And that all took place over the very recent time.
Now, in the meantime, I'm seeing 91 dollars -- 91 cents a gallon out on the road. Okay? A lot of people are happy. I see very inexpensive jet fuel. We're trying to save the airline industry. But I want to save our great energy industry and that's what we're doing.
Yeah. So I would -- I would absolutely do that. And what we'll do -- the price will still be very low -- but what we'll do is we'll save -- and, very importantly, we'll save tens of thousands of jobs.
One of the other things we're doing is having oil shipped to our strategic oil reserves. Okay? And, you know, we're buying it for the right price and we're shipping it. In some cases, we're storing it for nothing. They're there. We're filling up our reserves with this very inexpensive oil. Nobody thought they'd ever see a price -- this is like from the 1950s, where they had big dollars, okay?
So, no, I would use tariffs if I had to. I don't think I'm going to have to because Russia doesn't benefit by having this and Saudi Arabia doesn't benefit by having it. They -- you know, oil and gas are their major sources of income. So it's obviously very bad for them.
But we have to -- we have an industry that's a very important industry and it's really formed beautifully. It was the virus that killed it because what happened is it's down 40 percent from the day this happened -- 40 percent. Otherwise, it would be doing phenomenally well. So that's it.
Yeah.
No, but I like the concept of it. I think it's good. We're talking about a different way of doing it, but I like the concept.
I like the concept of infrastructure. Our country has to be rebuilt. They spent all this money in the Middle East -- $8 trillion. We're up to now $8 trillion in the Middle East. We got to rebuild our country. Okay? We have to rebuild our roads, and our schools, our bridges. We have to rebuild our country. So, I like an infrastructure bill.
I also like money going directly to people. It's not their fault that this happened.
And I do think this -- especially the faster we can get it open, our country -- can you believe we're talking about our country, getting our country open? The faster we get it open, the bigger the boom, the bigger the rocket ship going up. I think it has a chance to go really quickly, relatively quickly. I'd like to see very quickly, but we'll see.
But part of the stimulus and part of what we're doing, that will help it. And the nice part is we're paying practically zero interest rates. You know we're paying very little. It's one of the reasons I like the infrastructure bill, because we're borrowing -- we have a strong dollar. And the advantage to a strong dollar is everybody wants to invest in this country. They all want to buy our dollar.
I think so. Yeah, from what I'm hearing that's --
Yeah, a couple of weeks. That's what I'm hearing. Yeah.
Please.
Yeah, we -- we discussed it with the staff. We discussed it with FDA. Well, the FDA approved it. So, you know -- which is another point. I mean it's been approved by FDA, which is very important. If it wasn't approved by FDA, then I couldn't do this. But FDA has approved it, the hydroxy.
Well, we'll see if it works. No, it's not going to -- it's not going to hurt people. It can help them, but it's not going to hurt them. That's the beauty of it, you see. It can help them, but it's not going to hurt them. What do you have to lose?
Okay, a question? Yeah, in the back, please.
Right.
Well, we're going to have to -- we'll answer that question later. All I can say is that right now things are looking now things are looking really good and opening up with a bang will be a great thing. And there's nobody going to be happier than me.
Please, go ahead.
Yeah.
Thirty-two thousand will be what?
In addition to the ones that we've already sent?
Don't forget, we have almost 10,000 -- a little more 9,000 right now. And those are ready to rock should we need them.
And we had to keep it. You understand that: flexibility. So that if we need them in New York -- which we might not -- if we need them. But they're ready to move. We have -- we're all ready. Military -- it's a military operation. We are ready to move. They'll be moved immediately into whatever section of the country we need.
Would you like to answer that by the way?
Yes.
No, but they're not going to be long. They've started. GM, Ford, we have many -- we have 11 companies -- approximately 11 companies -- building them. And we're going to have a stockpile for future -- hopefully, we never have to use them. They should have -- the hospitals, the states should have bought a stockpile. They didn't do that. So we've made up for it.
But if we have extras -- other countries need them. I mean, you see UK needs them badly, France needs a badly, Italy needs them badly. They need them. So, it's complicated. It's a big piece of equipment. It's expensive. And we'll be able to help other countries after we take care of our needs.
Yes, please. Go ahead.
I actually choose you, but that's okay.
I'll let him go. That's all right. Go ahead.
No, I know. And because they don't do construction techniques that work and that are better. I mean, I see a highway and that's -- which is what I do. I do construction -- what I did.
I see highway that's good but it's got a bad top, and it's got a big base -- concrete base underneath. And I'll see them come in -- I don't want to say where, but I could tell you; I could give you plenty of examples -- and they rip the hell out of it. They take out the base. They take out everything. Now they pour a new base that isn't as good, isn't as deep, isn't as thick. The concrete base was fantastic -- the footing. It takes forever.
Wait a minute. It takes forever. And instead of scraping out the asphalt, or whatever may be the top -- scraping it off and putting the new asphalt down, putting the new median in. They could have done it.
And then they open the highway and it starts to crack. The reason is because it hasn't been set. And they spend 10, 15, 20 times more money than they have to. I never believe, when I watch these people doing highways and doing roadways and doing work, how they take the most expensive solution. And the bottom line: The job itself is far worse.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, but hopefully they're not going to be staying at home for long. Hopefully, this will be out and we're not going to have that kind of time. If we have that kind of time, we made a big mistake.
Please, go ahead.
Who has that information?
Go ahead, Mike.
Tuesday they go out.
Some have gone out, by the way, but the big bulk of them go out on Tuesday.
Yeah, please.
No, there's not a change, but we're supposed to be the backup. But like in Illinois, the governor couldn't do his job so we had to help him. We're sending 600 ventilators. We're building a hospital in McCormick Place. We're doing it.
So we have some people that were not able to do. We have other people that needed a little help. We had -- in New York, we had to give a lot of help, but we've worked very well with Governor Cuomo and with Mayor de Blasio.
But, no, we are meant to be the backup, but we've taken on a much bigger role than that, and that's okay. I have no objection to it.
Now, in some cases, it's worked so well, where they're actually now seeing -- they think they're over -- over the big problem. And they're actually calling us and they're saying, ""You can take your equipment back now."" But we're really deployed as a backup, but I feel we're much more than that. They've done a much better job.
I will say this: I don't think that the people that have represented this country, the federal government -- whether it's the Admiral and the generals and all of the people that we call to the fore -- I just -- they're heroes for what they've done. What they've been able to do in a short period of time -- they took a system that was broken, just like we did the military. Our military was broken. Our military was depleted and it was broken, and we've rebuilt our military. We've rebuilt this whole system too.
And I -- in a way, Kelly, I appreciate your question because, you know, you're hearing all of the things that we're -- the millions of masks, the hundreds of thousands of gowns. And they're surgical -- you know, they're protective gowns at the highest level. We're getting it to the various states. And most of the governors are very happy.
Now, a lot of times, you know, it's politics. Maybe I do the same thing, I don't know. But they'll try and act not so happy.
I will tell you, when I speak to them or when the Vice President speaks to them, they're singing the praises of all of these people. So I always take umbrage when -- when somebody says something about what we've done.
Now, to do this -- to do this should have taken --
To do what we've been able to do and to build it to a level, it should have taken a year. It should've taken two years. They did it in a matter of weeks. And we're helping states.
No, it's them. As an example, New York had the right to buy 16,000 ventilators. They could have bought them. They didn't. I understand why they didn't. It was a very expensive purchase. You know, a very expensive -- and that's a lot: 16,000. And they chose to do something else with their money. I understand that. The problem is when something like this comes along, which you don't expect.
Look, 1917 -- that's a long time ago -- perhaps 100 million people died. That's a long time ago. So people don't think it's going to happen. I would have, frankly -- I mean, did anybody in this room think a thing like this could happen? But it happened. And we built up a force. This is a military operation, as it turned out -- it really is -- with FEMA, with the Army Corps of Engineers.
I mean, Army Corps of -- and you were very gracious on that point. The Army Corps of Engineers is building 2,500 units of beds and everything else now. And then Governor Cuomo called and he wanted it to go COVID, meaning, for the problem. And we said, ""Well, it wasn't supposed to be that way, but we want to get it done."" And we've moved military personnel, so now military personnel are operating it.
And I'll tell you what's -- what's good. It hasn't been very full. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. It hasn't been. Now, maybe over the next week, something will happen, but it hasn't been.
But we have -- because it's better than the other alternative where we run out. But they built actually 2,900 beds. And we have -- also, we built four medical centers in New York. We've built four hospitals, four medical centers, and a lot more than that.
It's such an honor to have done it. But the people that did it are amazing and they have to be appreciated by the states, not me. They don't have appreciate me at all. I don't care about me. They have to appreciate the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses.
I mean, we're bringing now 3,000 people in that are medical professionals that are coming from all over the country to help New York City, help New York State, and help many other places.
I just think it's incredible what they've done, and I don't think that they've been appreciated. Me, you can forget about. Me, you can forget --
Yeah. Yeah, I rea- -- I actually mean it. They have to be appreciated.
Go in the back, please.
I do. I do.
I see light at the end of the tunnel.
If I didn't, I would not be -- I would not be very thrilled with what we've done. No, I see light at the end of the tunnel. I think indications are some of the numbers coming out today. I think, you know, we had a very good meeting today. We're seeing things that we don't even report because we think it's too early to report.
No, I think, you know, we're seeing things happen that are very good. And we also know -- all of us, including the medical professionals -- that we have to open our country up. We have to get go- -- we have to open our country up. No country was designed for this, where you close it. We're in the midst of the greatest economic boom in history for any country. Our country had the greatest economic boom in history. We had the most people working that we've ever had, almost 160 million people. And then from 160 million, they want nobody to leave the house.
You know, you could use the term ""cold turkey."" Right? That's called ""cold turkey."" Countries are not designed -- this country is not designed for that. We have to get our country back. And I think it's going to come back, and I hope it's going to come back very quickly.
Yeah, please. Go ahead.
That's good.
No, she feels that way.
She feels that -- I -- I would wear one. I mean, I just -- generally, I'm not in a -- like, I should -- would you like me to wear one right now and answer your question? That would be a little awkward, I guess.
But, no, I mean -- again, I would wear one if it was -- if I thought it was important.
She -- she thinks -- she likes the idea of wearing it, yeah. She does. A lot of people do. Again, it's a recommendation, and I understand that recommendation and I'm okay with it.
Wouldn't be surprised.
Sure. What would you like to know?
Sure. Doctor?
. I mean, you know --
He's called ""an American who loves our country.""
Yeah.
And we've made great progress with the antibody testing. Fantastic progress.
Do you know how many times you've answered that question?
Maybe 15. Fifteen times. You don't have to ask the question.
He's answered that question 15 times.
Good.
That's a very -- a very good answer. All right, I think that really could be it. That was a very -- I love that answer, especially on the facemask. I thought it was very good.
Go ahead.
Oh, stop it.
Who are you with? By the way, who are you with?
Who you with?
Are you ready? Are you ready? Let me just
answer your question because I know exactly -- you know, the same question you ask all the time. Ready?
They have done an unbelievable job in delivering --
For the Associated Press, which is, you know, not so great, not like it used to be.
The people that you're looking at -- FEMA, the military -- what they've done is a miracle. What they've done is a miracle in getting all of this stuff. What they've done for states is incredible. And you should be thanking them for what they've done, not always asking wise-guy questions.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
",Press Conference: Donald Trump Holds the Daily Coronavirus Pandemic Briefing,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-coronavirus-briefing-april-5-2020
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2018-05-16,"Hello everyone! Thank you!
I’m very happy to be here with you today
Thank you for that kind introduction, Niobe.
Andrew, it’s wonderful to see you again. I am so grateful for the honour you and NYU have given me today.
You know, Andrew is an honourary Canadian and British Columbian because, like me, he studied at UBC back in the day.
It makes me proud that Canada was part of Andrew’s formation, just as NYU has helped form so many amazing Canadians, including two members of my own staff. 
I’m told 180 of the NYU class of 2018 are Canadians. Hello! Well done!
I have to say, to be here now, speaking with all of you – in Yankee Stadium: one of the greatest places in one of the greatest cities on Earth – is more than a little humbling.
My friends, you are now NYU graduates – the best and the brightest.
You have great potential and possibilities. And therefore, you have enormous responsibility, too.
So today, I’d like to talk about the nature of both those things.
And I’d like to offer you a challenge.
One I think is essential for your future success as individuals, and as the leaders you are becoming.
Among the many things I admire about NYU, is that about a fifth of the students are international. And a similar proportion are the first in their families to go to college.
This group is truly diverse in every possible way.
I think that is extraordinarily valuable and important.
When I graduated in the early 1990s, I went on a trip around the world with a few good friends – and who remain good friends to this day, which is sort of a miracle.
We trekked, mostly overland, from Europe, to Africa, to Asia. That remains one of the great formative experiences of my life. It was an amazing adventure.
But it was also enormously important to my continued, broader education. Because it forced me, really for the first time as an adult, to meet, engage with and befriend people whose views and experiences, ideas, and values, were very different from my own.
When a kid from Montréal meets a Korean fisherman living in Mauritania, befriends a Russian veteran of their Afghan war, or a shopkeeper and his family in Danang, interesting conversations happen.
Now, maybe some of you have talked of doing something like that after graduation.
And I’d be willing to bet one of the first things you heard was a warning: “You can’t do that in this day and age. It’s not safe!”
But here’s my question: Is it really just the issue of physical safety that makes our loved ones so anxious?
Or is it the threat that if we look past the frames of our own lives, of our own community’s structured values and belief systems, to truly engage with people who believe fundamentally different things, we could be transformed into someone new and unfamiliar?
There’s no question that the world today is more complex than it was in the mid 1990s. There are serious and important problems that we are grappling with and will continue to grapple with.
But we are not going to arrive at mutual respect, which is where we solve common problems, if we cocoon ourselves in an ideological, social, or intellectual bubble.
There’s a peculiar fascination with dystopia in our culture today – you see it on TV and in film.
But the truth is that, on balance, we have the good fortune to live in a time of tremendous possibilities and potential; a time when we have it within our grasp to eliminate extreme poverty, end terrible diseases like TB and malaria, and offer a real chance at an education to all.
But for us to keep moving forward, we have to do it together. All together.
Humanity has to fight our tribal mindset. We go to the same church? Cool, you’re in my tribe.
You speak my language? You’re in my tribe.
You play Pokemon Go? You’re a vegetarian? You like the Yankees? You go to the gun range? You’re pro-choice?
Tribe.
But of course, it's not the ‘belonging’ part that’s the problem, it’s the corollary:
You are part of my tribe, and they are not.
Whether it’s race, gender, language, sexual orientation, religious or ethnic origin, or our beliefs and values themselves – diversity doesn’t have to be a weakness.
It can be our greatest strength.
Sometimes people talk about striving for tolerance. Now, don’t get me wrong: there are places in this world where a little more tolerance would go a long way, but if we’re being honest right now, right here, I think we should aim a little higher.
Think about it: Saying “I tolerate you” actually means something like “Ok, I grudgingly admit that you have a right to exist, but just don’t get up in my face about it. Or date my sister.”
There’s not a religion in the world that asks you to Tolerate thy neighbour.
So let’s try for something a little more like acceptance, respect, friendship, and yes, even love.
Why does this matter? Because, in our aspiration to relevance; in our love of our families; in our desire to make this world a better place, despite our differences, we are all the same.
When you meet and befriend someone from another culture or country who speaks a different language or who worships differently, you quickly realize this.
And here’s my main point, and the challenge I’m offering you today.
Our celebration of difference needs to extend to differences of values and belief, too.
Diversity includes political and cultural diversity. It includes a diversity of perspectives and approaches to solving problems.
It’s far too easy, with social media shaping our interactions, to engage only with people with whom we already agree. Members of our tribe.
This world is bigger than that.
So here is my request: As you go forward from this place, I would like you to make a point of reaching out to people whose beliefs and values differ from your own. I would like you to listen to them, to truly listen, and try to understand them, and find that common ground.
You have a world of opportunity at your fingertips.
But as you go forward from here, understand that just around the corner, a whole different order of learning awaits, in which your teachers will come from every station in life, every level of education, every belief system, every lifestyle.
I hope you will embrace that.
You have been students, you will continue to learn all your life, but now it is time to become leaders.
In every generation, leaders emerge because they one day awake to the realization that it’s not up to someone else to fix this problem, or take up that cause – it’s up to them.
Now is the time for you to lead.
Leaders.
I’m sure that’s a word that’s been tossed around you and at you quite a bit over the past few days, weeks, and years. Leaders of tomorrow. Leaders of today.
Well, I think you need to be brave. Really brave.
And I know, when you think of courageous leaders, you think of those folks who stood implacably and fearlessly, anchored in their sense of rightness, willing to pit their ideals against all comers, against the slings and arrows aimed their way.
Well, I don’t think that’s brave enough. I don’t think that’s good enough for what our shared future will ask of you. I actually don’t think it’s ever been.
He was raised and educated as a proud, Catholic French-Canadian, an exemplary representative of one side of the two identities that had come together to found Canada just a few decades before.
It was impressed upon Wilfrid by his teachers and elders that he must stand up unflinchingly for the values and identity of his heritage, those beliefs and approaches that were his birthright, and would be his legacy.
That THAT was leadership.
But Wilfrid grew to believe otherwise. He realized that it’s actually easy to stand rooted in the conviction that you are right, and either wait for others to come to you, or wait for your chance to impose that rightness on others. It is actually harder to seek compromise.
To dig in deep into yourself, your ideas and convictions, honestly and rigorously, to see where you can give, and where you do need to stand, while opening yourself up to the other point of view, to seek out and find that common ground.
And that remains Wilfrid Laurier’s political legacy, more than 100 years later.
To let yourself be vulnerable to another point of view. That’s what takes true courage.
To open yourself to another’s convictions, and risk being convinced, a little, or a lot, of the validity of their perspective.
Now that’s scary: discovering that someone you vehemently disagree with might have a point. Might even be right.
But it shouldn’t be scary, or threatening. Particularly to all of you, who have worked so hard these past years to pursue truth, to learn, to grow.
Being open to others is what has gradually led Canadians to the understanding that differences can and should be a source of strength, not of weakness.
We’re not perfect, of course, but that sense of openness, respect for other points of view, and acceptance of each other really does underpin our approach as we try to solve the great problems of our time.
And that’s how we come back to you, and the leaders the world needs you to be.
Leadership has always been about getting people to act in common cause. “We’re going to build a new country! We’re going to war! We’re going to the moon!”
It usually required convincing, or coercing, a specific group to follow you.
And the easiest way to do that has always been through tribal contrasts: “They believe in a different God! They speak a different language! They don’t want the same things as we do.”
But the leadership we need most today, and in the years to come, is leadership that brings people together.
That brings diversity to a common cause.
This is the antithesis of the polarization, the aggressive nationalism, the identity politics that have grown so common of late.
It’s harder, of course. Always been easier to divide than unite.
But mostly, it requires true courage.
Because if you want to bring people around to your way of thinking, you need to first show them that you are open to theirs.
That you are willing to enter into a conversation that might change your mind.
Show respect for their point of view, and you have a better chance of having them actually listen to yours.
And regardless of what happens, you will have had a genuine exchange that focused on understanding, not on winning a debate or scoring points.
And you will both be improved for it.
Let me be very clear: this is not an endorsement of moral relativism, or a declaration that all points of view are valid.
Female genital mutilation is wrong, no matter how many generations have practiced it.
Anthropogenic climate change is real, no matter how much some folks want to deny it.
But here’s the question: do you want to win an argument and feel good about how superior you are? Or do you want to actually change behaviours and beliefs?
It’s been pointed out that one of the many differences between Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis was that Davis preferred to win a debate, while Lincoln would rather win the war.
And that’s the question: Do you want to win an argument, or do you want to change the world?
With malice toward none, and charity toward all. Let those greatest words of this country’s greatest president guide your ambitions, your hopes for yourselves, your families, your country, your planet.
There is no shortage of cynicism and selfishness in the world. Be their answer, their antidote. I am abundantly optimistic about the future because of you. It is yours to make and mold and shape.
The world eagerly awaits, indeed requires, your ideas. Your initiative. Your enterprise. Your energy. Your passion and compassion. Your idealism. Your ambition.
But remember that true courage is the essential ingredient in all your efforts.
Congratulations Class of 2018. Go change the world.
Thank you!

Donald Trump,United States of America,2015-07-18,"Thank you, thank you. Beautiful, look at that.
Hello.
Both.
I think both.
A great question. Common core has to be ended. It is a disaster. It's a way of... I am sure some of you may be due.
I will, I will. Because people want to hear the truth, Frank. I watch you all the time; they want to hear the truth. We are so politically correct that we cannot move anymore. And Frank, and Frank...
We have to be able to express ourselves.
Too far?
You're using the word again? Oh, no, not at all. No, I've happy.
Let me tell you, not at all. No, not at all. I am so proud of the fact that I got to dialogue started on illegal immigration.
And people in the media, in all fairness, they were very rough on me in that first week, and now then many of them have apologized to me. And almost everybody -- because it has turned out I was right. Beautiful Kate in San Francisco was shot by in illegal who was here five times and they couldn't do anything about it, and believe me, Mexico kept pushing him back, because they didn't want him. Believe me, that's true.
And now, everybody is saying that trump was right. But I tell you, I took a lot of abuse. I had disloyal people like Macy's, and like others, oh, Donald, you're a little controversial, we're going to have to drop you, we're going to have to -- I said, I don't care, the ties, what do they mean to me? He's wearing one of my ties, by the way, it's very nice. Very nice.
Excuse me, excuse me...
You have to let me speak, Frank, because you interrupt me all the time. No, I know him too well, that's the problem. Let's take John McCain. I'm in Phoenix.
We have a meeting that is going to have 500 people at the Biltmore Hotel. We get a call from the hotel, it's turmoil. Thousands and thousands of people are showing up three, four days before -- they're pitching tents on the hotel grass. The hotel says, we cannot handle this, because it will destroy the hotel.
We move it to the Convention Center. We have 15,000 people -- the biggest one ever. Bigger than Bernie Sanders, bigger than -- 15,000 people showed up to hear me speak. Bigger than anybody, and everybody knows it.
A beautiful day with incredible people that were wonderful, great Americans. I will tell you. John McCain goes, oh, boy, Trump makes my life difficult. He had 15,000 crazies show up.
Crazies, he called them all crazy. I said, they were not crazy. They were great Americans. These people, if you were to see these people -- I know what a crazy is.
I know all about crazies. These weren't crazy. So he insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. I said, somebody should run against John McCain who has been, in my opinion, not so hot.
And I supported him. I supported him for president. I raised $1 million for him. That's a lot of money.
I supported him. He lost, he let us down. But, you know, he lost. So I have never liked him as much after that, because I don't like losers.
He hit me -- he's not a war hero.
He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK? I hate to tell you. And I believe -- perhaps he is a war hero, but right now, he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him, that these people aren't crazy.
And very importantly, and I speak the truth, he graduated last in his class at Annapolis. So I said, nobody knows that. I said, he graduated last -- or second to last, he graduated last in his class at Annapolis. And he was upset, I said, for what? For telling the truth? See, you're not you're supposed to say that somebody graduated last, or second to last in their class, because you're supposed to be like Frank says, very nice.
Folks, I want to make America great again. We want to get down to brass tacks. We do want to listen to his stuff with being politically correct and everything has -- we have a lot of work to do. Frank, the other day, Hillary Clinton got up and she said I didn't like Mr.
Trump's tone. We have people, Christians being -- having their heads cut off in the Middle East. We have people dying all over the border, that is where I was right, 100 percent right. We have all of this, like, medieval times.
And she said, I didn't like his tone. You know who else said that? Jeb Bush. I didn't like his tone. What does it have to do with tone? We want results. This group wants results. We don't want tone.
That is a tough question. I don't think in terms of -- I have -- I am a religious person. Shockingly -- because people are so shocked when they find this out, I'm Protestant, I'm Presbyterian, and I go to church, and I love God, and I love my church. And Norman Vincent Peale -- the great Norman Vincent Peale was my pastor, the power of positive thinking.
Everybody has heard of Norman Vincent Peale. He was so great. He would give the sermon, and you never want to leave. Sometimes we had sermons and every once in while we think about leaving a little early, right, even though we're Christian.
. Norman Vincent Peale, Frank, would give a sermon, and I am telling you, I still remember his sermons. It was unbelievable. And what he would do is bring real life situations, modern-day situations into the sermon.
And you could listen to him all day long. When you left the church, you were disappointed that it was over. He was the greatest guy. Then he passed the way, but he was great -- he wrote The Power of Positive Thinking
I am not sure I have, I just go and try to do a better job from there. I don't think so. I think, if I do something wrong, I think I just try to make it right. I don't bring God into that picture.
I don't. Now, when I take -- you know, when we go in church and when I drink my little wine, which is about the only wine I drink, and have my little cracker, I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness. And I do that as often as possible, because I feel cleansed, OK? But, you know, to me, that is important, I do that. In terms of officially -- see, I could tell you absolutely, and everybody -- I don't think in terms of that. I think in terms of, let's go on and let's make it right.
Yes, sir?
Right.
No. No. I won't go on record as saying that. Look...
I want this country -- this country has great potential. But soon it's not going to have that potential, because we are being drained by incompetent leaders, by horrible people. As an example, with the Iran deal, which is a total disaster, we didn't get our four hostages back. That's just one aspect of it.
And just this morning -- and yesterday, Kerry, Secretary Kerry, who is the worst, worst negotiator, I mean, he didn't read The Art of the Deal We want our hostages back, how is that complicating the deal, right? We gave them money, we did -- so he didn't want to talk about the money, he didn't want to talk about the hostages. It was just announced that Iran got one of their leading nuclear scientists back as part of the deal. Just came out this morning. So Iran, in addition to making an unbelievable deal that is going to make them one of the great powers, perhaps more powerful than the United States, because today it is about the weapons, not about the number of soldiers you have.
They're going to be immensely wealthy -- we are giving them billions of billions that we shouldn't give them. We didn't get a hostages back which is terrible, because they didn't want to complicate. We didn't want to come to get the negotiations. And when Obama was asked about that question the other day by major -- he was asked a very simple question.
The anger in his face at being asked that question, he said, we didn't want to complicate it. How is that complicating it? Except for one problem: Iran just got their big scientists back and we just found out about it this morning. I think we are run by a group of incompetent people and they are destroying our country. Just one other think.
Nobody deals with politicians more than I do. I contributed to everybody, they did what ever I said -- everybody. And you know what, I was a businessman, why wouldn't I? I didn't have to agree with them.
I know this, like with my wedding, I said Hillary, Bill, be at my wedding. They were at my wedding, it was a nice, OK. Because I contributed. Wait, Frank, it's important...
My last wedding. The last one. But -- but -- you have to do -- as a businessman, you have other things, and you have other things to do. So, I'm very proud of a record -- no politician, in my opinion -- I know them all, I watch them, they talk about the moon and the sun, the sun will rise, the mood will set.
I watch them. People want jobs. No politician is going to get this country back. I'm sort of a politician because I been dealing with politicians all my life.
If you can't win and make a lot of money with politicians, you are not very good. Believe me. I have been dealing with them all my life, and I don't think anybody has dealt with them any better. I know them and I know it from the other side.
All the people -- like when you see Bush has $100 million, and you see Hillary has $50 million that they got, they just announced, those people are controlled by those people that gave them money: their lobbyists, their special interests and their donors. And I will tell you -- I will tell you that they are totally controlled, and when Bush has to make a decision , and can you imagine this guy negotiating against China? We have no chance, okay? Who would you rather have negotiating against China? Trump or Bush? You tell me.
I know, I know.
It's really had a big influence. I have five wonderful children and I knock on wood, I hope that's wood, but I -- I get maybe almost more than any question, I get questions similar to that because my children have done well. You know Ivanka, she's a great girl, she's a great person. But Ivanka, and Don and Eric, you know my kids have -- my three oldest children has done well.
They've gone into business and they're solid and, you know, they haven't been in trouble, and all of this. And more than any other question I get from people is How did you raise your kids?"" Because And the other important element was I would from the time they're two years old say No drugs But I would constantly, because I've seen so many children grow up and they get under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and their parents are brilliant people, they're successful people, the kid is brilliant, they have no chance, they have no chance. Once they're under the influence of drugs or the alcohol, life is too tough. They're not gonna make it.
So, I was very strong with my children. No drugs, no alcohol, and I threw in cigarettes. And they...
Yes.
I would have dinner with my kids almost always, and I'm always available to my children. I can be in the middle of the biggest, most important deal. For instance, if Ivanka called me right now, I would say, Bye bye
Maybe not, maybe I'd say wait ten minutes. But -- but I was always available to my children and, you know, frankly, I have said it -- I was actually a great father. I was a better father than I was a husband, and the reason is I was a worker. And I had, you know, you mentioned the -- the relationships.
They were very good women, but I was always working. I was working. I was creating jobs, I was building jobs, I was doing everything and legitimate stuff. I was working and it was very hard for a woman -- and I blame myself, I don't blame anybody else, but it was a work thing.
It wasn't a bad thing, and it's -- it was very hard for anybody to compete against the work, and that was not good. I have learned that.
That's a great question. The -- the thing that I have learned -- I know all of the very successful people in the world, I mean most of them, I know, you know, they buy apartments from me. I sold an apartment recently for $55 million a Chinese person, and then they said I don't like China. I love china, I just don't like the fact that the Chinese leaders are so much smarter than our leaders and they rip us off all over the place.
But, say, by the way, Frank, same with Mexico. Love Mexico, respect Mexico, love the Mexican people, thousands of them work for me, they're incredible -- I just don't like that the Mexican leaders are ripping off our country because they're smarter and more cunning than our leaders and our negotiators. you know, between the trade and the border, they're killing us. So, it's one of those, but...
Well, I'm -- I'm trying to get out the points, Frank. You know, I mean...
I -- I was going to say. I found that the happiest people, let's get down to the happiest people, are the people that have good families. I -- I know the richest people in the world, I know the toughest people in the world, I know these people, they're brutal. You wouldn't like them and they probably wouldn't like you very much.
These are brutal people, great negotiators, great business people, but not nice people, they're not the happiest people. They are very rich, they are very smart. I would use them to negotiate against Japan. I would get one of them, bing, you're here, you're here, you're here like checkers, like -- like chess.
But I will tell you, they're not the happiest people. The happiest people I see are the people that have great families. It's, you know, whatever it is, I mean I don't know. And -- and just to take -- just to take that a step further, and I tell this to people all the time, they say, How do I get rich So, I don't know, it's -- it's a great thins.
Religion is a very big factor, too. I have seen people that are -- have a great family and they have God and they have church and they love their church. I -- I have friends that love to go to their church and help their church. They're happy people.
Well, I pray, I go to church, I -- do I do things that are wrong? I guess so. You know, I'm a business person, I really do well at business, I -- I -- I've done great. I've made some of the great deals. I own some -- I own some of the greatest properties in the world, and my totally...
... I -- I think God helped me. Personally, I think God helped m. I think, you know -- look, God helped my by giving me a certain brain, whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.
You know, I -- I went through phenomenal school, the Wharton School of Finance, which is said to be the greatest business school in the world. I did really well there. I was a great student. So, I mean, I was born with a certain intellect that is good for this.
And -- and essentially Frank, look, when you boil it down, we need a president that's gonna be able to make deals, great deals, because we're getting killed. We're losing -- our gross national product went down, our GDP, if you look at it, growth domestic, went down in the first quarter. It became negative. When China goes up seven or eight percent -- I saw the other day, China's went up seven percent, it was like in China they're going crazy, how could it only go up -- we had a negative.
Think of it. We had a negative number. It's unheard of. GDP goes down fairly substantially, and it think it's gonna continue to go down.
That means we're getting smaller, and yet we have more people, many of which pour across the border, by the way, but we have more -- we need somebody that can take our jobs back from china, Frank. We need somebody that can take our jobs back from Mexico. We need somebody that can take our jobs back, Frank, because we're going to hell, our country's going to hell, and Frank doesn't like the word hell. But we're going to hell and we need somebody that's gonna be able to bring our jobs back.
You could do both, frank. It doesn't have to be one without the other. It doesn't have to be one without the other. Look, if I'm elected president -- I know everybody, they can't create jobs like me, nobody's gonna be close.
They can't negotiate with China like I can negotiate and take -- and -- and by the way, and every single other country in the world, we don't make good deals anymore. If I could make the country strong financially, it's a lot easier for the country morally. I mean, our country -- you -- you look at what's going on. We are in serious trouble.
Our military is -- we sent weapons over to our so-called allies and one shot is fired and we lose 2,300 Humvees, armor-plated. I mean, we don't know what we're doing, we truly don't know what we're doing. If I can make our country really strong, I would focus on the military. I'll tell what, I'd focus on the vets, I love the vets.
The vets are treated like fourth-class citizens in our country..... and that's part of the morality. These guys went out, these people went out and they fought for us and they're great people, the best people, and they're treated so badly.
I've gone -- I've been with vets where they say, they go to a doctor's office in -- in one of the places, and they'll wait four to five days before they -- in a reception area before they can even can see a doctor. That's morality too, and that's really bad morally. I would -- I -- I think your question is very good, but I think they have to go hand-in-hand because our country is a better nation -- we are in serious trouble, and we've got to make us, I know it sounds a little bit rough, we've gotta make our country rich again, we have to make our country great again. We can't let other parts of the world steal our country, steal our jobs, steal our manufacturing.
With that being said, the morality of this country, with the right president -- President Obama, I never thought he'd be a good president, but -- because I didn't think he was qualified. But I thought one thing that he would do, he'd be a great cheerleader for the country. He's has been horrible.
I don't know if he loves America. I -- I hope he loves America. I don't want to get into that, I hope so.
I have no idea. You know what, Frank? You're asking me questions. Ask his wife, OK? I don't want to -- I don't know. But -- but...
... but you know what, I -- I was hoping and I thought the one thing I thought about him -- I saw him speaking in Germany, I saw him speaking -- I thought he'd be a good cheerleader for the country. He's been horrible, he's been divisive, he's been horrible. He hasn't even called Kate Steinle's family, who got killed in -- he hasn't called.
He calls other people, but he hasn't called the family of Kate Steinle. Why wouldn't he call her? And this was a man that came over, was pushed over from Mexico -- five different -- he shouldn't have been here, an illegal immigrant killed -- and nobody's even called her family. OK? I think morality and I success go hand in hand. You don't have to have one without the other.
Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I get a standing ovation, other people don't.
Thank you.
","Speech: Donald Trump Participates in a Town Hall in Ames, IA",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-ames-ia-july-18-2015
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-10-16,"Well, thank you very much. It’s a great honor to have the President of Italy with us. He is a man of great distinction. He’s highly respected in this country. And it’s nice to have you at the White House. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We’ve had a great relationship with Italy for a long time.
I don’t think it’s ever been closer than it is now. We have won a $7.5 billion award from, as you know -- I guess it’s been pretty big news. And I know that this is against the European Union and World Trade -- good ole World Trade. For a long time, they’ve been taking advantage of the United States.
And I know Turkey is going to talk to us about their share of it because they feel they shouldn’t have to pay so much. And if you look at what’s going on, Italy is complaining about it. Turkey is com- -- everybody is complaining about it. Turkey is complaining about a lot of things, and we’re handling Turkey very nicely.
But we have many countries complaining about the different awards that we’ve been winning lately from the courts. And the reason we’re winning is we’re properly represented. We’re winning, in the case of the European Union, $7.5 billion. And Italy has a percentage of that to pay. And, in the -- in other cases, we’ve won.
And we have a lot of money coming into the United States for the first time ever. Tremendous amounts of money in many different forms, including tariffs. Our farmers now have been taken care of well. China has already started their purchases. There was some misreporting, which does not -- frankly, I’m not at all surprised -- but there’s been some misreporting that China will start purchasing when the deal is signed.
The deal is being papered right now. Bob Lighthizer is with us. Mike Pompeo is with us. And they’re going to be joining us for the discussion. But there have been some reports that China is not buying until the deal is signed. No, China has started buying already from the farmers.
It’s a great deal for the farmers. I think the farmers will come out -- along with many other industries in the United States -- will come out as one of the big beneficiaries of the trade deal with China. But they have already started purchasing; in fact, they started purchasing three weeks ago. You can see the numbers for yourself.
It’s great for our country. It’s great for -- I think it’s great for China, too. But it’s something that’s already taken effect, even though the deal won’t be signed probably until I meet with President Xi in Chile, where we have a summit. So that’ll be good. But the World Trade -- as you know, we won $7.5 billion, and that is being distributed among various countries in the European Union.
Italy is one of those countries. And I know that the President of Italy wants to discuss that, and it’s one of the discussions. And the other thing, of course, is trade and numerous elements of the military, and terrorism, and security. So, we’ll be discussing everything. Please. We thought it was 50. Somebody reported 50. It was actually down to 28. They were removed a while ago.
All American soldiers are away from the site. Syria and Turkey may fight. Syria is friendly with the Kurds. The Kurds are very well protected; plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they’re no angels, but they were with us. They are no angels. But they are fighting. We are largely out of that area.
We’re very well set. We have quite a contingent, right nearby, of soldiers and of the finest equipment in the world. I don’t think we’ll have to use it. So, Syria is either negotiating with or talking to Turkey. We’re also talking to Turkey. We’ve put massive sanctions on Turkey. Sanctions work, frankly, better than fighting.
Certainly when you’re down to 28 people, we’re not going to be fighting. We didn’t want to fight anyway. I don’t think there’s any reason to, from the United States’ standpoint. Now, as to Syria wanting to take back their land, that’s a whole different story. If Syria wants to fight for their land, that’s up to Turkey and Syria, as it has been for hundreds of years, they’ve been fighting.
And the Kurds have been fighting for hundreds of years -- that whole mess. It’s been going along for a long time. Syria may have some help with Russia, and that’s fine. It’s a lot of sand. They’ve got a lot of sand over there. So there’s a lot of sand that they can play with. But we were supposed to be there for 30 days; we stayed for 10 years.
And it’s time for us to come home. We’re not a policing agent, and it’s time for us to come home. But we’re working with Turkey. We’re working with talking to everybody in the area -- whatever we can to do keep it stable or stabilize it as much as possible, knowing that it’s possibly never going to be very stable.
And we are -- I think we’re in a very good position in the Middle East. I think we’re very, very strong in the Middle East. Iran is going to hell; their economy is in deep trouble. Their GDP went down 20 percent, which nobody ever even heard of before. Probably 25 percent. We’ll be talking to Iran also.
They want very much to talk. The sanctions with Iran -- all of the things that we’ve done, including some tariffs and different things having to do with countries that are dealing with them that we put on -- all of the economic sanctions are working very well. So, Iran will be an interesting case, but we’ll see.
They want to talk. We’ll see whether or not they talk. If they talk, good. And if they don’t talk, that’s okay, too. But I think we’re doing a very good job in the sense of, strategically, we have Syria talking about their land. It’s not our land. Turkey has gone on to Syria. And, if Turkey goes into Syria, that’s between Turkey and Syria; it’s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like us to -- would like you to believe.
And I watched, last night -- a couple of people understood. Actually, a couple of the Democrats -- I won’t say which ones -- but a couple of the more competent Democrats actually understood what I was doing and what the plan is. But, really, the plan is to get out of endless wars, to bring our soldiers back home, to not be policing agents all over the world.
If you look at other countries -- Russia, China -- they don’t have countries to take care of. We have -- we’re close to 90 countries, in one form or another. We’re in 90 countries all over the world, policing and -- frankly, many of those countries, they don’t respect what we’re doing, they don’t even like what we’re doing, and they don’t like us. So, we’re looking all over the world.
There’s tremendous amounts of money, manpower, lives that we save by doing it much differently. If people aren’t respecting what we’re going to be doing, that’s too bad. You read where we’re sending some troops to Saudi Arabia. That’s true. Because we want to help Saudi Arabia. They have been a very good ally.
They’ve agreed to pay for the cost of those troops. They’ve agreed to pay fully for the cost of everything we’re doing over there. That’s something you have never heard before, I think, as long as you’ve been standing out there. I think you -- the media has never heard that before. But Saudi Arabia has graciously agreed to pay for the full cost of everything we’re doing for them.
We’re sending some tremendous missiles over. We’re sending some great power over to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is paying for 100 percent of the cost, including the cost of our soldiers. And that negotiation took a very short time -- like, maybe, about 35 seconds. And I would like now to introduce the President of Italy to say a few words.
And I’m sure you’re going to have many questions for him. Thank you.
I think the bonds between Italy and the United States have never been more solid. I have so many Italian friends. I can't tell you how many Italian friends. And we have a lot also in your government. We have a lot of great friends in your government. I think the WTO award has been testament to a lot of good work by the Trump administration.
We never won with the WTO, or essentially never won. Very seldom did we win. And now we're winning a lot. We're winning a lot because they know if we're not treated fairly, we're leaving. Because we were a piggybank that every other country was robbing. And China became rich because of the WTO. That's when China really ascended.
That's when China went up. That's when they made their great rise. They were flat lining, and then, all of a sudden, around the year 2000, 2001, when they got involved with the WTO, it became a whole different story. And China was taking $500 billion a year out of the United States, plus intellectual property theft and many other things.
And it was -- I give China a lot of credit. I give the people that ran our country no credit. I give them discredit for what they allowed to happen. But the WTO -- that's the World Trade Organization -- has been very unfair to the United States. They know I feel that way, and I think since they know I feel that way, all of a sudden, we're starting to win very big awards.
The $7.5 billion that we won is going to be discussed. The percentage -- a percentage of that is to be paid by Italy. And Italy thinks that we're charging them too much, and we will certainly take that under consideration. And we will discuss that today. We're also discussing some very big trade deals. Actually, Italy is a very major trade partner with us. We do a lot of trade together.
And they make incredible product. We buy and they buy. And we have a very good relationship -- sometimes stymied by the European Union, which is, frankly, very tough to deal with and very tough negotiators, very unfair negotiators. They know I feel that way. And we'll see what happens, ultimately, with the European Union.
But they have been very unfair to the United States. Italy, on the other hand, they've been a great partner. Please.
He didn't say that at all. He's meeting. And he's meeting today with some of our representatives. Mike Pence is leaving today, as you know. We needed to take an extra day for security reasons. But Mike is leaving. Mike Pompeo will be meeting also, who is here right now with us. And he is going to be joining the meeting.
We have a lot of great people over there. We'll see. In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way -- as they shouldn't be -- as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us. And the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight. And, as I said, they're not angels.
They're not angels, if you take a look. You have to go back and take a look. But they fought with us. We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us, and that's okay. They did well when they fought with us; they didn't do so well when they didn't fight with us. When I refused to allow the Americans, a year and a half ago, to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, I said, ""Wait a minute, this country, stupidly, just spent a fortune on fighting for, with, around Iraq."" Nobody knows how they spent it. But they spent -- actually, we're in the Middle East now for $8 trillion, if you can believe that stupidity.
But, in Iraq, we're in for probably $5.5 trillion. So they're telling me, ""Wait a minute, we just spent $5.5 trillion fighting in Iraq and with Iraq. And now we're supposed to spend money to fight with the Kurds against Iraq."" I said, ""No, thank you."" So what happens is, when I said we're not going to fight with the Kurds, the Kurds left.
They didn't want to fight against Iraq, which right now isn't the greatest fighting force in the world. That happened twice. The Kurds, actually, are pulling back substantially from Turkey. And Syria is pulling in. Syria probably will have a partner of Russia -- whoever they may have. I wish them all a lot of luck.
You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan. Used to be called the Soviet Union. Now it's called Russia for a reason, because they lost so much money in Afghanistan, that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing. So, if Russia wants to get involved with the -- with Syria, that's really up to them. They have a problem with Turkey, they have a problem at a border.
It's not our border. We shouldn't be losing lives over it. But again, we only had 28 soldiers. It was 26, 28. I got all different numbers. It ends up being 28 -- between the 26, 28. Two people, and they're fully accounted for. So, that's the story. It's very simple. And we're watching and we're negotiating, and we're trying to get Turkey to do the right thing, because we'd like to stop wars regardless.
Whether Americans are in or whether they're not in, we want to see wars stopped. That's a very important thing. On a humanitarian basis, we want to see that happen. Steve?
Why don’t you go and dictate?
Yes, please.
I'll let you go.
So I view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant. Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe. They've got to work it out. Maybe they can do it without fighting. Syria is protecting the Kurds. That’s good. We are -- and, by the way, every player hates ISIS. Everybody we're talking about.
Syria more than us. Russia more than us. They've done a big number on Russia. And we're over there fighting ISIS, but they're over there fighting ISIS, too. They can handle it, and they should handle it. We can fight our own battles on our own territories. But you have a lot of countries over there that hate ISIS as much as we do; in some cases, probably more.
So they can take care of ISIS. We have them captured. The United States captured them. Some were released just for effect -- to make us look a little bit like, ""Oh, gee, we've got to get right back in there."" But you have a lot of countries over there that have power and that hate ISIS very much, as much as we do. So I think we're in a very strategically good position.
I know the fake news doesn’t make it look that way, but we have -- we've removed all of our, as we said, 50 soldiers, but much less than 50 soldiers. They're now in a very -- very safe location, heading into an even safer location. And we will help negotiate. We have tremendously powerful sanctions. Our country has become economically much more powerful than, frankly, it ever was.
We've picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in worth. The market was up big yesterday. It's going to be up big today, it looks like. The trade deal with China, just having to do with what we've done with the financial services, with banks, with the farmers, has been incredible -- far greater than anyone ever thought.
I agree, it hasn’t been papered yet, but it's being papered. But, in the meantime, as you know and as we've said many times, China has already started buying. They want to buy. They want to make a deal. They really have to make a deal. Their economy has been hurt very badly by what we've done and by the tariffs that we've charged.
And we've taken in tremendous amounts of tariffs. A small portion of them we've given to the farmer, which -- the farmers -- which has more than made up for what they've lost. Go ahead.
And, right now, they're not even close. And if we're smart, they never will get close. But it depends on who sits in this chair. But the United States has tremendous economic power. Far more power than playing around with having a few soldiers shooting each other at the border. I mean, you have a few soldiers back and forth, killing each other at the border.
The power we have with sanctions and tariffs is far greater than what we're talking about. With that being said, our military has been completely rebuilt. Much of the equipment has already been delivered. We spent two and a half trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years. And our military power is at the highest level, and our economic power is at the highest level.
But I'd always rather use economic power before I use military power, because people aren’t getting killed with economic power. Okay?
Well, in theory, there can’t be retaliation because this was an award that we got because of the fact that the European Union took advantage of past Presidents, and this was an award that we got for the unfair treatment given to the United States by the European Union. So there should be no retaliation.
This was getting us even because $7.5 billion worth of things happened -- bad things happened, unfair things happened -- to the United States by the European Union. So this was just getting us back to even. And nobody else but me would’ve gotten that $7.5 billion back for the taxpayers of the United States.
Look, John Bolton -- I got along well with him. Some people didn’t; some people didn’t like John Bolton. I actually got along with him pretty well. It just didn’t work out. I don’t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani. Rudy Giuliani was seeking out corruption, and what happens mostly in the 2016 election, because there was tremendous corruption in the 2016 election.
I think even you would admit that. The election was -- it was disgraceful what happened, and what happened to me, and what happened to the Republicans. And that continues with Nancy Pelosi and with Schiff. Adam Schiff got caught making up statements that he said I said, that I didn’t say -- which is fraud.
I mean, it's purely fraudulent. So it continues. So, Rudy was a great prosecutor. He was the best mayor in the history of the city of New York, as far as I can see. I think he's pretty much acknowledged -- what he did for crime and everything else. And when he saw what was going on with our election of 2016 -- the election I won, but the election that was absolutely corrupted by things that took place in government.
Now, we'll see what happens. The IG report is going to come out soon, and we'll see what happens. I think people -- I know nothing about it, in terms of the report. I'm waiting for the report like everybody else. But I predict you will see things that you don’t even believe, the level of corruption -- whether it's Comey; whether it's Strzok and his lover, Page; whether it's so many other people -- McCabe; whether it's President Obama himself.
Let's see whether or not it's President Obama. Let's see whether or not they put that in.
Wait a minute. Let's see whether or not. So, Rudy saw that. And I can tell you, Rudy Giuliani -- because was very, very incensed at the horrible things that he saw, as are many people, okay? And many Republicans. And the Republicans have been treated very unfairly by the Democrats. I'll say this: Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena.
I don’t say right or wrong. He wouldn’t do it. He had too much respect for our country. Nancy Pelosi hands them out like cookies. Everybody -- I don’t even know these people. And for the most part, people like that are test- -- I don’t even know who they are. I never even heard of some of them, most of them.
But I have all these people testifying. And then they leak out. They don’t say the goods parts; they only say the bad parts. We're not allowed to representation. We're not allowed to lawyers. We're not allowed to have anything. The Democrats are treating the Republicans very, very badly. Fortunately, we have a lot of good, strong, smart Republicans.
But they never dealt, Jon, with the Democrats the way the Democrats deal. And the Republicans won't forget it because what they're doing, what the Democrats are doing to this nation is a disgrace. What they have done -- the disrespect that they've shown to the presidency -- and it'll happen to them. Because if the Republicans have the House, which I think they will -- because of impeachment, I think -- because of this nonsense impeachment.
It's based on a perfect phone conversation -- an absolutely perfect phone conversation with the President of Ukraine. A friend of mine, who's a top lawyer, read it. He said, ""This is perfect. You didn’t say…"" Did you know this was going to happen? I actually thought it was going to happen. There were many people listening to that conversation, because when I speak to a leader -- like, if I speak to the President of Italy, if I speak to anybody -- I know that there are many intelligence people on the line.
I know that, I mean, with my understanding and knowledge. I don’t know exactly who, but I assume there are many people. Fortunately, they had transcribers, stenographers -- people that do this for a living -- on the line because we have an exact copy of the report, of the call. So the call was put out immediately when I started hearing about the whistleblower.
Well, the whistleblower's report was totally wrong. The whistleblower didn’t know what he was talking about, or was given false information, or it was even worse than that. Now, all of a sudden, Schiff doesn’t want to talk to the whistleblower. Now, all of a sudden, quid pro quo doesn’t matter because now they see, in the call, there was no quid pro quo.
So, with Rudy, Rudy was seeking out corruption. And I think there's nothing wrong seeking out corruption. Did you have -- Steve?
I don’t know what he did. I -- I don’t know. That’s up to him.
That, you have to ask -- excuse me, no. You have to ask Rudy those questions. Don’t ask me. But Rudy was one of many people that was incensed at the corruption that took place during that election. Pure corruption. For instance, I still ask the FBI: Where is the server? How come the FBI never got the server from the DNC? Where is the server?
I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server. I think it's very important for this country to see the server. Nobody wants to see it. The media never wants to see it. But I'll tell you, Republicans want to see it. So, Republicans aren’t treated well.
And here's the problem: I think we're going to take the House, based on what's happening with the impeachment stuff. And the Republicans can do the same thing in reverse if they ever have -- and I hope it's going to be a long time, because nobody has done a better job with the economy, with our military, with -- I've rebuilt the military.
Our economy is the best it's ever been. We have numbers that just came out where, not including taxes, the median household income for the average American has increased $5,000 in a very short time since I've been President. Nobody has ever heard of numbers like that. So, people want to find out: Why was it so corrupt during that election?
And I want to find out more than anybody else. Steve, go ahead.
We're confident, and we have a great -- a great air base there, a very powerful air base. That air base alone can take any place. It's a large, powerful air base. And, you know, Turkey -- just so people remember -- Turkey is a NATO member. We're supposed to get along with our NATO members, and Turkey is a NATO member.
Do people want us to start shooting at a NATO member? That would be a first. And that's all involved having to do with NATO. Yeah.
Well, I'd say this: I think that she's done this country a tremendous disservice. She's created a phony witch hunt -- another one. The first one failed. They're all failing. This one is just absolutely crazy. All you have to do is read the transcript of the call. Read the transcript. This is a open and shut, simple case.
They're desperate because they know they're going to lose the election. They're desperate to do something because they know they're going to lose the election. This administration has created the strongest economy in the history of our country. We have the greatest stock market. We had -- over 100 times, we broke the record for stock market.
. Record stock markets. And don’t forget, stock market is not just rich people; it's all people. Because all people own in the stock markets.
The New York Stock Exchange, all of them -- they're at record highs. Nobody has ever done what we've done. So, they're playing games. They figure they can't win the election, so maybe we can find some ground. ""We'll get somebody that Trump never met, and maybe they'll say something bad about Trump. And if they do really bad, maybe it can stick a little bit."" I don’t think it's going to work.
They've treated the Republican Party with great disrespect. Okay, thank you very much.
My meeting with the family was really -- it was beautiful, in a certain way. They did not want to meet with the person in question. But we had a very good meeting. They're very nice people. And we met with the full group. It was four people, actually, as you -- you know how it's all broken up. And the meeting took place right here at about 6 o'clock last night, and it was very sad, to be honest.
She lost, and they lost, their son. I believe it was going down the wrong way, because that happens in Europe. You go to Europe and the roads are opposite. And it's very tough. If you're from the United States, you do make that decision to make a right turn where you're supposed to make a left turn. The roads are opposite.
And she said that's what happened. That happens to a lot of people, by the way. But she said that's what happened. She was in the room right out there. We met right here, in these -- this area. And I offered to bring the person in question in, and they weren’t ready for it. But I did offer. I spoke with Boris.
He asked me if I'd do that, and I did it. Unfortunately, they wanted to meet with her, and unfortunately when we had everybody together, they decided not to meet. Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time. I don't know exactly. I know the people were lovely. They were very nice. And they were, you know, desperately sad.
I thought they were. Based on what I saw, they wanted to meet. But now they say they only want to meet if they're in the UK. And that'll be up to them. But I did meet the family, and I expressed condolences on behalf of our country. Thank you very much, everybody.
Wait, there's a great question I'm being asked. This is maybe the greatest question I've been asked in a long time. Please put those mics over here. Go ahead.
We are looking at Italy very strongly. And, as you know, the seven and a half is to be divided the way we say. We've divided it up. Italy has got a problem with the way we've divided it up because they said they had much less to do with it, and Germany had more to do with it, and France had more to do with it, as an example.
So we are going to look at that very strongly. Ambassador Lighthizer is here. We're going to look at it very strongly. Okay? Thank you. Good question. I love that question. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
Yeah, I'll bring you in, right? I'll bring you in. They're doing a bad thing. I'll talk to you. I'll talk to you. Thank you very much, everybody. Steve, please treat them nicely. Treat Italy nicely, please.
Huh?
Yeah. That doesn’t always happen. Thank you.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilaterial Meeting With Sergio Mattarella of Italy,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-italy-mattarella-october-16-2019
Donald Trump,United States of America,2004-11-24,"I don't know what happened, Larry. It's been a lot of fun. I'm having a good time, but I'm not exactly sure what's happened. It's been wild. The Apprentice has been a tremendous success. The real estate in New York has never been better. I've never been -- I've never done as well as I've done. I'm the largest developer by far in New York. And I'm just having a good time.
Well, Atlantic City's doing well. I mean, yes, I put a lot of debt on the property years ago, and now I made a deal that's really terrific. It's less than 1 percent of my net worth, so it doesn't mean a lot from that standpoint. But I think Atlantic City is actually going to be a substantial part of my net worth in the future. As you know, I worked all that out with bondholders, and they were terrific, and I was terrific, and I think Atlantic City is going to be a very big factor and, frankly, the gaming industry in the future. But, right now, it's really just less than 1 percent of my net worth. Frankly, without The Apprentice
Well, you can't lose faith. I mean, you always have good times and bad times, and you really can't lose faith. I don't want to lose faith in myself.
If I did, I wouldn't be talking to you right now, I guess. It's been just very good. I've had a great life.
I've enjoyed my life. I've had a lot of fun. I've had some downs, but, you know, I've had friends that went out of business, you'll never see them again.
I never went bankrupt. I never any of the things that so many people had to do over the years. And, you know, my company today is much bigger and stronger than it ever was in the past by far.
You know, they used to talk about me as an '80s guy because I had a hot company in the '80s. But my company is many times bigger than it was in the '80s. So I'm just having a lot of fun.
And then, on top of it, we have the hottest show on television, and it's been just great. The Apprentice has been a lot of fun. Working with Mark Burnett and his whole staff has really been a lot of fun for me.
Well, that's a mindset, Larry. It's really just -- really in the truest sense of the word, it's a mindset. You have to think like a winner, and most billionaires are winners, although I could see that Mr.
Branson or Mr. Cuban have been sort of losers lately. They got clobbered in the ratings.
And I know in the case of Cuban, his show was taken off the air, and I think Branson will soon follow. He had almost nobody watching the other night. But, you know, generally speaking, you have to think like a winner. You have to enjoy what you do. If you don't enjoy what you do, it's never going to work, and maybe almost as importantly as that, if there's a wall in front of you, you have to go through it. You can never, ever give up.
Well, I enjoy winning. I love winning. I love beating people and especially when they get a little bit nasty.
I mean, Cuban started getting a little cute with me and a little nasty to get some publicity for his show and it failed, and I enjoy, you know, rubbing it in his face when he does fail. And the same thing with Branson. I mean, Branson was going around saying how great I was, and then, all of a sudden, a week before his show goes on, he gives me negative stuff.
Oh, he doesn't want to shake anybody's hand. Of course, that's sort of an intelligent thing to do. And I do shake people's hands. But, you know, I'm not a man of the people, right? He is. But the fact is that, you know, as far as Branson's concerned, I doubt -- I personally don't see how he could be a billionaire. He's in the airline business. Who's a billionaire in the airline business? So, you know, he's got a show called The Rebel Billionaire. It had terrible.
I watched the first 15 minutes of it, and, after that, it was virtually unwatchable.
Well, you know, he tried to copy The Apprentice. but I have real people. I have great people And it was a bad copy of me, and I think it was a bad copy of other shows, frankly, other reality shows. He probably tried to put it all -- but the one he was attacking was me, and The Apprentice So, you know, I don't need to be attacked for that. I should be complimented. And, actually, he started out complimenting me, but some wise person said about a week before he went on that you should really not compliment Trump, you have to go after him to get a little publicity. And he did, and he got a little publicity, and he failed.
Well, I think it's a lot of things. I think that, you know, we have a nice cast, but I'm not sure that that's the answer. I think Mark Burnett has done an amazing job, and I think I've done an amazing job. It just works.
Well, I would have never thought that those words would have become -- if I walk down the street, hundreds and hundreds -- and even thousands in some cases -- of people shout out You're fired I went into a stadium the other day, and the entire stadium was screaming You're fired. So who would have known The Apprentice was going to be a ratings juggernaut and just this great phenomenon?
Well, I have said it, but I've said to people that stole. I mean, generally speaking, you don't say it, Larry, because it's too harsh. In fact, I fired somebody yesterday and I took 20 minutes to explain to him why he can do better outside of my company. I do it nice and easy. Of course, they wake up the next morning, they hate you anyway because they realize, hey, I just got fired. But there's something very beautiful about the words, and when we started...
Well, there is. It's very succinct, there's no question about it, and it certainly plays very well, and it's become an amazing phrase.
Larry, you're fired.
No. I don't like firing people. I'm not Leona.
I'm not other people. I don't really enjoy firing people. But I have certainly a good time on the show.
It just works for the show so well, and, you know, it's not like, oh, gee, please, give me another chance. It doesn't work that way. It's so succinct. It's so beautiful in its finiteness. And it's just -- it's over. It's just over. And, you know, this happened on the first show of The Apprentice I was going to say, Hey And I heard them just screaming. And they were probably 50 yards away. And I said, What's going on? I didn't even know what happened. And they loved it so much. So this was something that I came up with during my first boardroom scene and I used it. I've used it since.
Elizabeth, all of your people that you were leading are saying you were terrible.
What the hell's missing with you? Let me ask you: Would you pick two people or three people to come back to the boardroom?
Honestly, Elizabeth, I just don't think it's necessary. You're fired.
Well, should I fire Yvonna right now?
Kevin, who would you fire?
There's more spark right now in the final minutes before execution than there was for two days, and I can't believe you led the team so badly. And, Chris, you're fired.
They've done unbelievably well. If you look at Nick and Amy and Omarosa -- I mean, Omarosa -- people couldn't stand her, and she's making a fortune. They've all done really well. And the new crop are absolutely equal at least, are just making a fortune after they get fired. So they have done -- they have hit paydirt. Somebody was telling me that Troy goes out and makes speeches for $20,000, $25,000 a speech. So they're all very happy, and, you know, Larry...
Bill Ransick is doing fantastic. He's probably making less money than anybody else. But Bill Ransick is absolutely a winner. He's been a fantastic guy and a fantastic asset to me. And, as you know, we're starting a $900 million building in Chicago. We just started construction of it, and Bill's involved, and he really couldn't -- somebody asked me the other day, would you have done Bill again, would you have hired him again, and the answer is absolutely yes. He's been even better than I anticipated.
Well, of course it's awkward, but a lot of things don't work out and you get by it. But Bill has worked out and he just couldn't be a better guy. And he's learning. He's an apprentice.
Well, Troy is fantastic. But I also understood that when I did it, I wasn't being that generous. I really would love to do it. But Troy's probably 32, 33 years old. He's got a family and children, a fantastic guy, and I think it's going to be hard for him to go back to college, OK. So, when I said I'll pay for your education, how do you go back to college at that age with that family? But I think that if he does go back -- and I hope he goes back in a certain way, but, in another way, he's got to take care of a family. So I'm not sure it's going to be easy. But I certainly will pay for his education.
I don't think so. I respect them. I like them. I guess I like them even more because the show has become so successful, and, you know, they've become legendary people in their own right. So there's a certain, you know, family spirit there. But emotionally involved? No.
Well, I've never seen a successful person without an ego. Never. I have never -- I've watched over the years, and I look for it, and I try and be as non-egotistical as possible and all of that stuff, Larry. But I've never seen a person who was successful who didn't have an ego or, maybe to put it in your terms, who didn't have confidence.
Well, you know, I do a good job, Larry. I'm the biggest developer in the city. I do a great job in real estate. I do a good job at what I do. And, frankly, you know, you might as well say it.
No, that was a joke. I said -- in fact, Mohammad al Fayed owns it. He's a friend of mine. And I said I think I'll buy the Ritz and give it to Melania, and every -- it became a front-page story. It was just a joke.
Well, I'm just starting in Vegas. We have a great building going up. A friend of mine -- a great friend of mine is Phil Roughin who owns the Frontier, and we're doing a 64-story Trump International Hotel and Tower, and it's going to be beautiful. We should start it within a few months, and it's just going to be an amazing building. It's a condominium. And when it's completed, I think it will be just absolutely one of the top buildings anywhere.
Well, I may do that second. I mean, I wanted to get there with my real estate business first because the real estate is so good in terms of what I do, and I do it so well, and I may very well end up doing that. You know, the gaming company that I have is a very -- has become, with the advent of the deal I just cut, a very, very strong and powerful company, and maybe I'll take that there afterwards. But, right now, I'm building a residential and hotel tower, and it will be, I think, a tremendous success. It's a condominium.
Well, I think the politicians and the casino control commission and everybody -- they all work together. They've really made it a tremendous place. It's tremendous esprit de Corp, spirit.
There's just a great feeling going on in Las Vegas, and I like it. I love going there. I've had a great relationship with many of the people out there.
Steve Winn is a good friend of mine. I mean, so many different people I have out there, and, you know, you look at the great job that Terry Lanny's done and Kirk Kerkorian and all of the people at MGM and so many other companies -- they really have done a great job. But the government has led them down a very correct path. Now maybe they influenced the government, and that's a positive thing. But Vegas has just been a great phenomenon, very much like The Apprentice has been a phenomenon. You don't know why sometimes.
Oh, sure I respect. And, you know, I like a lot of people that I respect. Oftentimes, you don't like people that you also respect, but the people I mentioned, I like them all very much.
. You're a brilliant guy, great education, and I have no doubt that you're going to be a big success. But, for right now, Bill, you're hired.
Well, I think I was known, Larry. I think I was known all over the place, but...
... I guess nothing like this. Look, when you have, you know, a super hit show on television, you probably are known better, but, you know, somebody was saying, oh, you're on the cover of all these magazines in the last six months and year, and I said but I was on the cover of all these magazines before, other than perhaps TV Guide and a couple of them. You know, I was on the cover of TIME And it was sort of interesting looking at that clip. When I said Bill
... but it doesn't have the beauty of So-and-so
Well, I hate the fact that she's doing the prison time because I think it really nullifies the appeal. I think it's hard for an appeals court judge -- and I know a lot of the appeals court judges, and they're brilliant people and they're terrific people, but how do they -- it's very hard for them to now all of a sudden overturn something when she's in there. It's like -- and this is psychological.
This isn't law. This is psychologically it's awfully tough for them to say, OK, let her out, she's OK, the trial -- let's do a mistrial, let's do something. And I really tried to encourage her not to go.
And now she also wants to get out -- you know, she wants to get on with her life. So, from that standpoint, I can see it. From the appeals standpoint, I think she did a terrible thing. And I saw the other day where she wants the $4 million legal fees to be paid by her company, and I'm saying to myself she had such bad lawyers. I mean, they did a terrible job for her. Can you imagine being charged $4 million? And she's sitting behind bars right now. She's a great friend of mine. She's a great woman. She took a very, very heavy hit. But I think she'll come back.
No, I'm saying that I don't think the lawyers should be paid. That's what I'm saying. I thought I made that clear. I mean, you know, they got $4 million and look where she is, right? Give me a break.
Well, I think it's terrific. Look, you know, you had two good guys running. You have very -- you know, actually, you have to give President Bush a lot of credit. He really ran a great campaign. He won by four million votes, which is a lot. Now the electoral college, which I think they should do away with, is, you know, a little bit closer. But the fact is he won by four million votes, and that's a pretty good mandate in an election that was supposed to be so much closer than that.
I do. I like him. I like both of them, Larry. I like both of them very much. And they're both very different, but they were very talented and very everything. The fact is that President Bush won. He ran a great campaign. I think his tax policy is fantastic. It's going to get the nation going. I really believe that it's going to kick in. Maybe it's starting to right now. All of a sudden, the job reports are coming out great and a lot of other things. So I really believe in his economic policies toward this country, and, ultimately, we'll get out of Iraq, I hope, and...
... we'll do...
I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out. Now I do think we have other problems. I think you have to do something with the nuclear weapons that are obviously being built in Iran and the nuclear weapons being built in North Korea where they're -- that's not even obvious.
I mean, they're saying they're building nuclear weapons, and we're bogged down in Iraq. Now Iraq can solve the problem with Iran because you happen to be right next door, and, all of a sudden, Iraq maybe turns out to be a good transaction, so to speak. The fact is that Iran is building nuclear weapons and North Korea is building nuclear weapons, and that's the big quinella, and I hope President Bush can do something about that and quickly.
Boy, it's such hatred, so many years and years and even centuries of hatred, that it just seems inconceivable that they come together.
I would do that in a heartbeat. I mean, what's more important? They're killing each other. It's leading to beyond even them. I mean, it's leading to problems like nobody would believe long beyond them. But if he would ask me to do that, yes, I would do that.
. You lashed out at your project manager, which was completely out of line. Wes, you lost control of Maria, and you failed as a leader. You both did a horrible job.
Maria, you're fired. And I just have to do this. I have no choice. Wes, you're fired, also.
We all have problems. I don't like excuses. Omarosa has to go. You're fired.
Well I don't like excuses. And frankly, Omarosa had a lot of excuses, to put it mildly. But she's doing very well right now. That was one of the most popular firings. I mean, I had thousands and thousands of letters saying, thank you, Mr. Trump. But she was really -- I'll be honest, she seems like a very nice person on a personal basis. But she had some real problems with what she was doing.
Well I think it is. And I think it always has been. And it always will be. I mean, it's wonderful to say, gee, it's not part of it. The fact is it really has been. And if you look at President Bush and how well he did, a lot of that was from the very religious people. They really believed in him. And they believed in him strongly. It turned out to be a very powerful group. And I think there's nothing wrong with voting for somebody that you think believes the same way that you believe.
I was in my apartment, watching an interview of Jack Welch. And it was just an amazing tragedy, just the most horrible thing, the worst attack ever in this country. People talk about Pearl Harbor, but at least that was a sneak attack on soldiers. This was a sneak attack on civilians. There's never been anything like it.
Yes, I was. Actually, I built a specific window in my building that looks directly at the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center. And I saw the second plane hit. I saw everything. I got a very big view of that tragedy of what happened.
Well I think what everyone else did. We all watched. We all waited. We wanted to see where everything was going. And ultimately, I will tell you it's a great testament to New York, that New York City can be hotter than it ever has been before, ever. It's never been this hot before. That New York City with the greatest tragedy in American history, that a few years later, this city is hotter than it ever was before, is a tremendous testament to the people of New York.
Well, I think we just took a hit for the rest of the free world. I mean, this could happen in any other city. This can happen in any other country and it does. It constantly happens in other countries. And we took a real hit for the rest of the free world. And I'll tell you, I've never seen people respect New Yorkers more than they have over the last couple of years, because of the way that we took the hit. And the way we bounced back.
Well, I just want to give people a little bit of incentive and hope and other things. Because they can become -- and it doesn't have to be a billionaire, it doesn't have to be a millionaire. But they can become really, really successful by reading the book and using some of the principles I've used in the book.
One of them is positive thinking. But beyond everything else, just enjoy what you do. Really enjoy.
I've had so many friends that are talented but they're doing the wrong thing. They don't enjoy it. They're never, ever successful. So I wrote the book Think Like a Billionaire because I understand how billionaires think. And they think in a certain fashion. And that really can pertain to a lot of other people.
So I use it. And it's a catchy title. But the fact is that it's just been terrific. I'm so happy with the book, because I just wrote one why How to Get Rich. Then
I think a billionaire probably thinks differently. I have my thought process and it seems to work in terms of business. It so far hasn't worked that well socially, but these are minor details. But it works certainly in terms of business and money. I don't do things for the money, I do things because I enjoy doing them and I make a lot of the money because I enjoy and it they work out well. But I think a billionaire certainly thinks a little bit differently. And maybe in some cases a lot differently.
In my case, I really live to enjoy things. And enjoy what I do. It's my canvas. And money really -- it's an expression, I guess I have heard, but money would be a by-product, I think that's true, Larry.
Yes, finally after all these years.
Well, I say that, and we have fun with it. But the fact is, most of the people I know that are successful really don't take vacations. Their business is their vacation. I rarely leave. You know that. You and I are friends. How often do you see me going away? I never go away. I love it. Now, I'll go down to Mira Largo in Palm Beach, Florida. But I own Mira Largo, it's a very successful club, and I'll work. I go crazy when I have to go away for a couple of days on a vacation. So, if you really love what you're doing, you never take vacations. You know, when I go away I end up buying something in the community that I go away to. So, I'm always sort of working.
No, I think it's an asset to a certain extent. You want a little bit of a short span so you get things done. I know people, they agonize over details for weeks and months and nothing ever happens. So having a shorter span is not so bad. And you know, most of the people that you know, I mean, sadly, because I'm not saying asset or liability. But most of the successful people you know tend to have a shorter attention span.
Come on lets go. Come here.
OK. Will you please inform the public.
Don't mess it up to much.
It's really not that much of a comb-over. But I get killed on this hair.
Well, it's been lucky. I've never had any problems with it. You know, it's -- I will say, I am just abused. I mean, somebody said the other day, one of the critics that actually loved my show and hated the Branson Show My hair's not so bad.
I do get abused by my hair.
She likes it. So, she's smart. If I like it she likes it. So, she's a smart woman.
We're probably going to do it January 22nd at Mira Largo. I built a new ballroom at Mira Largo, that's really crying for a major event like this. And it's going to be terrific.
OK, you're invited.
It will be a terrific wedding. And hopefully it's going to be -- you know, my parents were married 63 years. And my father says, I greatly admire your success in your business, but I beat you in the marriage department. And he really did. It was 63 years. I said, but you had the advantage of having my mother.
That's right, in Brooklyn. I learned a lot from my father. He's a terrific developer.
Well, what happened is because of a lot of different things, and in all fairness even prior to The Apprentice
Well, I always say that there's no such thing as overexposure. So we'll see. I mean, you know, because in theory, look, I'm on television every week. Everybody's watching the show. It's a big monster, all that stuff. I don't know, it doesn't seem to be having any impact. But, you know, at some point, it will calm down. My attitude is, take advantage of it while you can.
I approve everything. I have wonderful people...
I approve it. I worked very hard with Estee Lauder and the top people at Estee Lauder, including Leonard and William. And you know, I've worked very hard on making sure it was the right bottling and the right scent and the right..
And I love it. I was never a fragrance person, Larry. And all of a sudden, they came up.
I'll be honest with you, I don't know too much about it. I said, give me some -- I don't know what I'm -- I said, I want you people to give me something that's fabulous, that's going to work, something great. And I like the thing they did. And you know what I tell people, if you're a man and you use the Trump fragrance, you're guaranteed to get any woman or man or whatever the hell you're looking for. Guaranteed.
Gays can absolutely use it. I'm sure they'll love it.
Well, I wasn't thrilled with what he did to be honest with you. And he got a free ring for promoting the jewelry company. And who knows if the jewelry company is even any good. But he got... But you know, from a business standpoint, I guess it's sort of cute, but I didn't like it. I certainly don't like it with respect to a wedding ring.
I talked to him. He's a very smart guy. He went to the Wharton School of Finance.
He's a good kid. He's doing a terrific job. And he thought it was, OK.
He had no idea this would get publicity like this. I mean, he ends up being on the front page of the Post and other papers. And I said, you have a big obligation, you have a name that's hot as a pistol, you have to be very careful with things like this. And you know, if you can make a good deal, hey I bought a ring, I got it from Graff, you negotiated hard. And I said you're going to get a lot of publicity and I want a great price, blah, blah, blah. But I don't do a big stunt over it. So, I think he learned a great lesson. He's a good kid. He's a smart kid. And I think he learned a great lesson. And he's marrying a terrific girl.
She's really -- first of all, she's terrific.
She's beautiful.
Well. She's a great girl. I think she's -- I think they're going to have a terrific marriage. I mean, off to an interesting start with this publicity, but that's all right. He was trying to be a businessman, and maybe from a business standpoint. You know, there are a couple of people who thought it was great. They said, hey, he's pretty smart. And he is.
Are they big?
He could have done without Bailey Banks, in my opinion.
I think of myself as a great builder. I'm the biggest, as I said, the biggest developer in the city by far, and I build great product. I'm building on 59th and Park at the old Delmonico Hotel.
As you remember, Ed Sullivan used to live there and a lot of your other friends. But I'm building a building that's phenomenal. I just finished a building opposite the United Nations, 90 stories, Trump World Towers.
I'm very proud of it. I'm building the biggest job ever approved by the New York City Planning Commission in Manhattan, on the west side of Manhattan, from 72nd to 59th Street. And what I am is a great builder. And then sort of interesting, you build a great building, it works. You work so hard, with the unions and labor and all the problems and construction. Then it works and they say, Trump's such a great promoter. I'm a builder. And I don't necessarily even consider myself a great promoter. I'm a great builder.
I think it's terrific. Woody Johnson's a friend of mine.
I think it's terrific. You know, people forget the Jets left New York, everybody was devastated. And now they're coming back and people are fighting it. I think Woody Johnson will get it done, and it will be a tremendous success. And we should have it in New York.
No, because it's Sunday. Most games are on Sunday. You have to understand, this isn't baseball where you play 165 or whatever it is games. This is football. And you're going to have about eight home games, not including the playoffs, and they're mostly on a Sunday. And that section of Manhattan is not all busy on a Sunday. I think it's a great thing for New York.
Well, look, Woody knows I'm the best builder, so he'll probably have me build it. But I haven't discussed -- I spoke to him yesterday, actually, about something unrelated. He's going down to Mira Largo, he loves the Mira Largo Club. He's a member of all my clubs. But he's a terrific guy and I think he's going to get it built.
. I want you, Houston, and Ellen to go out on the corner, the sidewalks of New York, the mean streets, and create a wonderful hot dog business. I want you to sell hotdogs. At the end of the day, you're going to come back to see me and I'll see how much you made in the sale of hotdogs.
It was. Katie's terrific. And that whole Today Show group is fantastic. I love them. You know
Well, I'm lucky. And I guess I got this from my parents. But I sleep very little, 3 or 4 hours a night. And that's what I need. And I have friends that need 12 hours' sleep. I say, 12 hours? What are you going to do? So how does somebody that's sleeping 12 and 14 hours a day compete with somebody that's sleeping 3 or 4 ? It doesn't work that way. So if you can -- now, part of sleeping not so much is enjoying your life. If you don't enjoy your life, I know other people when they're doing well and things are good, they sleep 5 hours. When things aren't going so well they're in bed all week long. But the fact is that sleep as little -- you're going to be sleeping for a long time someday.
Well, I am a great believer in computers and everything else. But honestly, I see kids coming out of school that if you say, how much is two and two, they can't add it up without going to their computer. So I think it's gotten too much. But hey look, I'm one of the great believers in technology. But maybe it's going overboard now.
Well it always is. And I've known many people over the years who are underestimated and they've done probably better than anybody else. And if you can create -- I see these sharpies come in with the beautiful suits and the handkerchiefs and the whole deal. And you sort of have your guard up. On the other hand, you have guys come in, you sort of take it easy, and they fleece you, Larry. They fleece you. You don't know what happened. You say, what happened?
Always true. I mean, if you can have the great family, if you have really terrific family, there's nothing better than that. You know that. You know what you're going through now compared to what you went through in the past.
The kids are fantastic, especially when they're the great kids. I've known some pretty bad kids. I've known some very bad sons and daughters to parents. But you get the right kids, there's nothing like it.
I have wonderful children. I have smart, wonderful children. I have four children. They're all fantastic.
I have Ivana with three, I have Marla with one, Tiffany. And they just -- I don't know. It's combination of everything. They're all different. I have wonderful children.
That's what I'm hearing. That's going to be next. You know what, I hope she does well. She's terrific. I hope she does well.
Well I mean, you know, you treat lovers when you get the love, I guess you're doing OK. You want to treat each decision very, very importantly, very gently. And make the right decision.
I've never met a successful person that wasn't curious. I mean, oftentimes I go out with somebody who's very successful, they spend the whole night asking me questions. And then I go out with people that aren't so successful and they're telling me things the whole night. So, being curious is a great thing.
Well, that's true.
You do a lot of talking.
Nobody does it better. It's been fun to be with you.
Well, I think I'm not going to do any more books. I've done six. Every one of them has gone to be a No.
1 best seller, every single one of them. And I think this is it. I've gotten -- unless I learn a lot over the next 10 years, I think I won't be doing any more books, Larry.
I'm really happy with the last one. I think the billionaire book might be my best book. Maybe even better than The Art of the Deal which was the biggest selling business book of all time But I think the last book could be my best book. And I've had it. I'm not going to do any more. I hate book signings. It's very, very difficult to sit down, and you have 4,000, 5,000 people waiting in a line, and you feel so guilty. And you sign 400 books and you leave and you feel guilty. I don't want to do that any more.
Thank you, Larry. You too.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-18,"Good morning, everyone.
I want to start today by confirming that Canada and the United States have agreed to extend by another 30 days the border measures that are currently in place.
This is an important decision, and one that will keep people on both sides of the border safe. It’s another example of the excellent collaboration between our two countries, and I want to thank Minister Bill Blair for leading the discussions with the United States.
We’re all here today, but it is the weekend.
And usually, a Saturday morning in April means getting outside to enjoy the sunshine, having a friend over for coffee, or just taking the kids to the park.
But these aren’t normal times.
We’re living through an unprecedented public health emergency, and we need to keep responding accordingly. So even as the weather gets nicer, and even in the weeks to come as we start seeing hopeful news—we can’t let up.
Because if we do, we could lose the progress that we’ve made.
Later today, you may see some new ads with people you know, like Hayley Wickenheiser, Chris Hadfield, Dr. Tam, Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, David Saint-Jacques and Dr. Mona Nemer, our Chief Science Advisor.
And they’ll remind you to “stay home and save lives.” That’s how we keep each other safe.
So stay at home. Limit your trips to the grocery store to less than once a week. If you do go out, keep two metres distance from each other. And as you do your part, know that we’re here to support you.
Over the past few weeks, we announced historic measures to help you get through this crisis.
With the Emergency Benefit, the Wage Subsidy and loans to small businesses, we support millions of families and workers across the country.
But we still have work to do. 
We still have people to help. So today, I am announcing further targeted support measures.
This morning, I am very happy to announce that the government will allocate more than $306 million to give Indigenous businesses the support they need.
This funding will be provided through Aboriginal Financial Institutions and administered by the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association. It will allow Indigenous businesses to access short-term, interest-free loans and non-repayable contributions so they are better positioned to make it through and rebound after this crisis.
Today’s investment will help thousands of businesses bridge to better times, including many that are owned and run by Indigenous women. These businesses employ people right across the country—in small communities and big cities alike.
So when we support them, we’re supporting families and workers, too. 
And this is just a first step—we’ll have more to say soon on what else we’ll do to help Indigenous businesses, and the people who rely on them. Small business owners are at the heart of so many communities.
And this is a tough time, whether you own a store, a restaurant, or are part of the hospitality sector.
So we’re going to be there for you.
With this new investment and with measures like the Canada Emergency Business Account, the wage subsidy, and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit—we’re focused on helping you. It will get easier.
But until it does, we need to be prepared to persevere.
And that includes ensuring that our frontline workers have the equipment and tools they need to do their jobs and stay safe.
Canada is continuing to receive shipments of personal protective equipment.
Yesterday, two planes full of N95 masks and coveralls arrived in Canada.
More shipments will be coming in this weekend and into next week, with additional medical supplies.
I can also announce that we will begin receiving deliveries of face shields from Toronto Stamp very soon.
They’ve shifted from their usual production of rubber stamps and ID badges, and will be providing millions of face shields over the next two months.
We all look forward to the time when this will be all over.
We all look forward to future Saturdays when we can see our friends or take our kids to a birthday party.
That day will come, but only if everyone keeps doing their part. So this weekend, stay home.
Continue to follow the experts’ guidelines.
And we will all get through this together.
Thank you.
",Prime Minister’s remarks on support for Indigenous businesses,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/04/18/prime-ministers-remarks-support-indigenous-businesses
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-08-20,"Hi, Sean. Those are two very familiar voices to me, and two great voices.
Well, it's true. And they are now telling -- and everybody is very proud of us. We're energy independent. Biden is -- and it's not Biden. I don't think Biden knows what it even represents, but Bernie and everybody else -- and Biden has totally accepted it -- they're anti-fracking. They're anti-everything.
They're anti-fossil fuel. And our nation would go into a massive depression if that ever happened. And when you talk about Pennsylvania and Ohio and Texas, by the way, and Oklahoma, they're anti-fracking. They don't want to do any fracking. And they can end it very quickly, and they will.
I have watched some, not that much, but I have watched some. A lot of hate.
Yes, I would say so.
Well, it's socialized medicine. That's what they're really -- socialized health care. They're talking about something that's so expensive the country can't afford it. And even if it could, it's no good. It's no good. It's socialized medicine. You're not going to have your doctor. You're not going to have your plan, which you didn't have when Obama promised you.
And 28 different times, he said that. So, no, they're talking about exactly that. And it's a ridiculous situation. They're also not talking about law enforcement and our great police. They're not talking about that. They don't want to talk about it. And they see Portland. And you see New York, with a 358 percent increase in crime, some number that's just crazy.
And you see what's going on in Chicago. But look at Portland. They're anarchists. They don't want to talk about police, because it's a losing subject for them. They want to defund the police. And they want to -- they want to abolish police. I mean, they're actually trying to do it in Seattle. The Democrat-run cities are a disaster.
That's right.
We could do it so quickly. Like, when you look at Portland -- and I just watched the young man on the screen, on your screen. And what they did with him last -- the other night was just horrible, when you look at it, horrible. And they're just thugs. And they're not being properly protected, because the police don't want to do that, and because the police aren't allowed to do their thing.
They're all good police, but they're not allowed to do their thing. They don't want to lose their pension, don't want to lose their job, although their job, they're feeling -- frankly, a lot of them are leaving, because they are just -- it's a shame, what's happened. You know, we were just supported by New York City's finest.
We -- Pat Lynch came over and gave us the endorsement of the New York police, and -- which is a great honor for me, because they're phenomenal. But they're not allowed to do their job. And we have the endorsements in Ohio and Texas and Pennsylvania and Florida. We just got the sheriffs, all of the sheriffs in Florida, at a ceremony.
And I don't know. I can't imagine they're ever going to endorse anybody who's going to endorse Biden, because they really have a very unsafe policy for our country. And you talk about suburbia. You know, we're all saying about suburban women. The fact is, they're going to really want to support me, because we're for law and order.
We're for safety and security. And Biden is not. It's just incredible. They have talked him into things that nobody would have thought possible. And he's not in a position to fight back.
Right.
Well, they don't want the police to use pepper spray or tear gas, which is, frankly...
... not so nice, but it's very standard for crowd control. If you don't use it, you can't protect. You saw where all of the police associations got together. And they said, in Wisconsin, we're not going to be able to do this. And, frankly, it didn't matter, because Biden didn't want to leave his home state.
He never leaves his home state. He hasn't answered a question since July 17 and -- July 17 or 27. I mean, for a long time, he hasn't answered a reporter's question. And he hasn't answered a real question from before that. So, I don't know what's going on. Something is going on. And I assume we will be able to find out sooner, rather than later, I hope.
But something is going on. It's very strange.
Well, you know, I don't want to get into that. Pretty obvious what's going on. I will say this. When you deal with President Xi of China, which I do all the time, and with President Putin, and with President Erdogan, and you're dealing with all of these people, Kim Jong-un -- of course, Obama never spoke to him.
I said, did you ever speak to him before going to war? He said, I never spoke to him. So, you know, you're dealing with these people. I can tell you one thing, they're very sharp. They're at the top of their game. And if you're not at the top of your game, it's not going to be a pretty picture. It's like chess masters, and if you're not a great chess master, you're going to have a problem.
And that we don't think he is. So, I don't know. You know, one thing you left off your list, that was, he wants to takeaway, they will take away without question your Second Amendment. That's like, without question. I've been fighting that successfully, very successfully. It's not going anywhere with me here and we have some good people.
Kevin McCarthy is great. And we really have some great people fighting for us. But the Second Amendment is gone. You can forget about the Second Amendment if we lose this election, and your taxes will be doubled, tripled, and quadrupled. Your jobs will be gone. I mean, you're going to have a depression if that happens.
And it's the biggest headwind. You know, we just set a new record in the stock market. And believe it or not, the biggest headwind, it would have been much higher. But the biggest headwind -- and that's during the pandemic, which I hope is nearing the final turn. But the biggest single headwind is if he got in.
If they didn't think, if we were just like last time, we won it and it went up like a rocket ship right after the election. The same thing would happen now. So, those 401ks will go up 25 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, but they will go down 40 percent or 50 percent if he gets in. All of this stuff that you're talking about is going to kill our country and kill the economy.
Right, record setting.
I think we're going to have a third quarter, a great fourth quarter, but we're going to have an incredible next year. And you look at -- you know, you're talking about the employment numbers and you look at the numbers that just came for the quarter, and they're record-setting, over 9 million jobs. And that's really with a minimum of stimulus, because as you know, the Democrats don't want to approve stimulus for people.
So, people, all they want to do is get bail out money for their governors who have done so badly in states like New York and Illinois. He's done a traditional job in Illinois. Pritzker is terrible. He doesn't know what he's doing. And, you know, they are having a hard time in California, as you know, although he's treated me very nicely, therefore I'm going to treat him very nicely.
But, you know, they are having a hard time. But they want bail out money in other Democrat-run states also. Republicans are doing very well. Republican states are doing great. You look at what's happening, they're doing great. But these Democrats -- and this is long-term. This isn't just over the last few years.
This is for many, many years. And they want -- they think they can use COVID-19 or they could use the China plague as we call it to get bail out money. And, you know, we don't want to do that.
No, without them, I would never -- you know, when I talk about them, I'm talking about without Biden and Obama, I wouldn't be president. I wouldn't have run. They were so bad. People don't remember the hatred and division. There was tremendous division, probably a little more quiet, but it was tremendous hatred and division that we had for eight years.
And, you know, people don't like to talk about that, but you remember it well. He was a terrible president. He was a very divisive person, a very divisive president. We had the slowest recovery in the history of our country from 1929, let's say, I guess they say, from 1929, the Great Depression, this was the slowest recovery we've ever had under him.
And then when I got in, it was a rocket ship. We gained. And now, incredibly, the stock market is -- I mean, Nasdaq is actually higher than it was at any time and the rest of it looks like it's going to be higher, just almost the same. And who would have thought that's possible? This is while we're going through this problem caused by China.
Well, it's a disaster and it's going to be, no matter how you look at it. They are sending out 51 million ballots to people that didn't ask for them. Now, absentee ballots are great. I used one for Florida. And a lot of people use absentee -- a lot of people in Florida use them. But that's when you go through a process.
You ask for it, they send it to you, and it's very secure. There is nothing like going to the voter's booth, by the way, but -- it's -- and we should have voter ID, which the Democrats don't want for obvious reasons, with your picture on it. But absentee is good. But they want to send what's called mail-in, universal mail-in ballots.
Fifty-one million ballots sent to who knows who? I mean, you know, where are they going? This is going to be the greatest scam in history. This will be the most fraudulent election in history. Fifty-one million ballots being sent to people. Many of them will have been dead. Many of them will get more than one.
But it's going to be a really horrible thing. It's just a horrible, horrible thing. And it's impossible to police. You had Carolyn Maloney, a congresswoman who's not a very good one, on the East Side of Manhattan. I mean, that thing was so messed up for weeks and weeks, and they just declared her a winner, but they have no idea where the votes are, where the ballots are.
It's gone. New Jersey, a disaster, it's been a disaster in New Jersey, a horrible disaster. And Virginia has been -- and we're talking about things that just took place, and small elections relatively. But now, they are talking about sending 51 million ballots out to anybody that -- you know, nobody knows who's going to get them.
It's a horrible thing. It's a fraudulent election. Everybody knows it. You don't even have to know politics to know it -- 51 million ballots are going to indiscriminately sent out to people that didn't even ask for them, people that say, hey, I just got a ballot. That's great. Let me vote. And it's a -- it's a terrible thing.
They're trying to steal the election.
We're going to have everything. We're going to have sheriffs and we're going to have law enforcement and we're going to have hopefully, U.S. attorneys, and we're going to have everybody, and attorney generals. But it's very hard. I mean, you have some of these states sending them out like Nevada where they don't even have to check the signatures so anybody can sign it.
New Jersey just sent it where the governor, as I understand, has just signed an executive order, didn't even go through the legislature to get it done. And nobody has ever heard of anything like this. So, they're going to be sending out 51 million ballots to people they have no idea why it's coming, who it's going to.
Unfortunately, they may have a very good idea the people sending them. They may send them to all Democrat areas and not to Republican areas, as an example. It could be the other way too, but I doubt it.
So, it's a very -- it's a very serious problem. And, you know, the other thing, a lot of times, you don't even have to send it back until after the election. So, on November 3rd, the evening, like we used to sit at home and hearing, ""Trump won the election, what a great thing"". And you saw how happy Hillary's people were.
They were thrilled when I won. You saw that. That's one of the all-time classic --
Do you remember during the debate -- the debate when she -- do you remember during the debate when she asked me very strongly, well, will you support the decision of the voters? And I'm looking at her and she didn't support it. She still doesn't get it. She's walking around saying, what happened?
Well, there is no trouble with the Postal Service. The Postal Service is going to do a good job. You know, it's not the Postal Service. It's what happens to these ballots when they are sent. Who are they being sent to? Who are these 51 million ballots being sent to? Where are they going? Who determines where they are sent to?
And you are talking about massive numbers. They couldn't Carolyn Maloney, who shouldn't be able to accept that position, by the way. I mean, they gave -- they declared her a winner over a guy that is right now looking around saying, what happened? He thought he won. They declared her a winner. They do that election over again in Manhattan.
It's a disgrace, that election. But that was mail-in votes. Now that's one small election. That was for a congressional seat in New York. What about -- you know, when you're sending them all over the country, 51 million, it's going to be about 51 million they estimate, and they're going to send them to every -- whoever sends those ballots is a very powerful person.
And on the assumption that the person is honest, it's still going to be fraught with error, even if somebody was going to be honest about it, because people die and then other people see it and they grab it and they sign it and they send it back. No, you're not going to have -- you can't have it -- it's impossible to have a fair election like this.
I will.
I'll watch. I will.
I mean, I'll watch...
But I might be watching -- I watched a lot of hate last night and the...
... night before.
Tremendous hate.
Yes, I think we're going to have more of it as live than what they did. I think it's pretty boring when you do tapes. I'm going to go live and do mine live. And Michelle Obama, as you know, taped it, and obviously long before because she had no idea who the vice-presidential nominee was, didn't get scolded for that at all.
They said, oh, wasn't that wonderful? So, I mean, she couldn't even tape it near, you know, the date. And then she had certain numbers wrong, certain very interesting numbers were way off. And so, she taped it obviously a long time before the evening it was aired. But and then they said, wasn't it wonderful?
You know, wonderful, she had a lot of hate. She had a lot of anger. But they did because, look, they thought they would win an election and they didn't. I've gotten to a point by the end of this term I'll have appointed 300 federal judges and two Supreme Court judges. And nobody has ever done that before.
And so, they're very, very upset, very, very upset. They thought it was going to be a victory. And places like Wisconsin that they always win, the Democrats, they ended up not winning. And Michigan they ended up not winning. And Pennsylvania they ended up not winning. And North Carolina they ended up not winning.
And Florida other places. It was quite an evening.
Well, he hasn't answered a question since mid-July, is what they reported tonight. And I am just saying, you know, I am answering questions all day long. Every time I pass reporters, I'll stop and say, go ahead, what do you want to know? I'll go give it. And you know...
The other thing is they're so nice to him. I mean, these reporters are so nice, they'll ask him the simplest questions. I've never seen anything like it. And some of the answers he reads off a teleprompter. That means he knows what the question is. And he reads an answer off the teleprompter. So, there is something going on.
And it's not fair to our country.
Well, I put a ban on people coming in from China who were heavily infected. I mean, they -- it was a very -- Wuhan, very, very infected area of the world. And I put a ban. And people were against that. And Dr. Fauci actually said that I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. And I also put a ban on Europe, when I looked at Italy and I looked at France and Spain, in particular.
I said, wait a minute, we have to ban. So, I put a ban. So, we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But we also saved millions of lives by closing up. We had the greatest economy in history of any country. Blowing away China, blowing away everybody. And I had to make a decision. And we closed it. We saved millions of lives, Sean.
When you see the number of 170 as opposed to, let's say, 2 million or 2.5 million lives, can you imagine if it would be that? But it would be 10, 15, or 20 times more if we didn't close it. So, we closed it. We learned about it. We learned that the elderly we have to protect, especially the elderly that have problems with heart or diabetes or anything.
And we've saved ultimately millions of lives by making that decision. And now we want to open up and the Democrats have to open up their states and cities and they have to open up the schools and let's play football.
I would. I would have no problem with it. I will tell you that we are very close. We are in the Phase 3 trials. And that's, you know, years ahead of schedule. I mean, normally that would be years before you would be there. And we have vaccine, we have therapeutics. We are going to do very well. And I think we are going to have some very good news very quickly.
They are doing fantastically. And even without that, doing great in Texas now, doing really good in Arizona, Florida. This country has done a fantastic job. We have done a fantastic job. The people have been incredible.
Right.
I think if I had said it I think I probably wouldn't be here right now. I can tell you that. And the White House, you have a picture of it up there right now. It's a beautiful place. It's a great place. It's so important, what it represents. How -- the greatness it represents. But no, we need somebody that is going to do the job.
We've brought back trade. We have incredible trade deals. We had the worst trade deals made by any country in history. And we've made them into great deals. We are doing well. We're doing well. We got hit by this China plague. But other than that. I mean, we were rocking. And now we're going to be rocking again very, very soon.
That's right.
Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.

Barack Obama,United States of America,2016-02-03,"Well, good afternoon. And, Sabah, thank you for the wonderful introduction and for your example -- your devotion to your faith and your education, and your service to others. You’re an inspiration. You’re going to be a fantastic doctor. And I suspect, Sabah, your parents are here because they wanted to see you so -- where are Sabah’s parents? There you go. Good job, Mom. She did great, didn’t she? She was terrific.
To everyone here at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, thank you for welcoming me here today. I want to thank Muslim Americans leaders from across this city and this state, and some who traveled even from out of state to be here. I want to recognize Congressman John Sarbanes, who is here. As well as two other great leaders in Congress -- and proud Muslim Americans -- Congressman Keith Ellison from the great state of Minnesota -- and Congressman Andre Carson from the great state of Indiana.
This mosque, like so many in our country, is an all-American story. You’ve been part of this city for nearly half a century. You serve thousands of families -- some who’ve lived here for decades as well as immigrants from many countries who’ve worked to become proud American citizens.
Now, a lot of Americans have never visited a mosque. To the folks watching this today who haven’t -- think of your own church, or synagogue, or temple, and a mosque like this will be very familiar. This is where families come to worship and express their love for God and each other. There’s a school where teachers open young minds. Kids play baseball and football and basketball -- boys and girls -- I hear they’re pretty good. Cub Scouts, Girl Scouts meet, recite the Pledge of Allegiance here.
With interfaith dialogue, you build bridges of understanding with other faith communities -- Christians and Jews. There’s a health clinic that serves the needy, regardless of their faith. And members of this community are out in the broader community, working for social justice and urban development. As voters, you come here to meet candidates. As one of your members said, “just look at the way we live...we are true Americans.""
So the first thing I want to say is two words that Muslim Americans don’t hear often enough -- and that is, thank you. Thank you for serving your community. Thank you for lifting up the lives of your neighbors, and for helping keep us strong and united as one American family. We are grateful for that.
Now, this brings me to the other reason I wanted to come here today. I know that in Muslim communities across our country, this is a time of concern and, frankly, a time of some fear. Like all Americans, you’re worried about the threat of terrorism. But on top of that, as Muslim Americans, you also have another concern -- and that is your entire community so often is targeted or blamed for the violent acts of the very few.
The Muslim American community remains relatively small --several million people in this country. And as a result, most Americans don’t necessarily know -- or at least don't know that they know -- a Muslim personally. And as a result, many only hear about Muslims and Islam from the news after an act of terrorism, or in distorted media portrayals in TV or film, all of which gives this hugely distorted impression.
And since 9/11, but more recently, since the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, you’ve seen too often people conflating the horrific acts of terrorism with the beliefs of an entire faith. And of course, recently, we’ve heard inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim Americans that has no place in our country.
No surprise, then, that threats and harassment of Muslim Americans have surged. Here at this mosque, twice last year, threats were made against your children. Around the country, women wearing the hijab -- just like Sabah -- have been targeted. We’ve seen children bullied. We’ve seen mosques vandalized. Sikh Americans and others who are perceived to be Muslims have been targeted, as well.
I just had a chance to meet with some extraordinary Muslim Americans from across the country who are doing all sorts of work. Some of them are doctors; some of them are community leaders; religious leaders. All of them were doing extraordinary work not just in the Muslim community but in the American community. And they’re proud of their work in business and education, and on behalf of social justice and the environment and education. I should point out they were all much younger than me -- which is happening more frequently these days. And you couldn’t help but be inspired, hearing about the extraordinary work that they’re doing. But you also could not help but be heartbroken to hear their worries and their anxieties.
Some of them are parents, and they talked about how their children were asking, are we going to be forced out of the country, or, are we going to be rounded up? Why do people treat us like that? Conversations that you shouldn’t have to have with children -- not in this country. Not at this moment.
And that’s an anxiety echoed in letters I get from Muslim Americans around the country. I’ve had people write to me and say, I feel like I’m a second-class citizen. I’ve had mothers write and say, “my heart cries every night,"" thinking about how her daughter might be treated at school. A girl from Ohio, 13 years old, told me, “I’m scared."" A girl from Texas signed her letter “a confused 14-year-old trying to find her place in the world.""
These are children just like mine. And the notion that they would be filled with doubt and questioning their places in this great country of ours at a time when they’ve got enough to worry about -- it’s hard being a teenager already -- that’s not who we are.
We’re one American family. And when any part of our family starts to feel separate or second-class or targeted, it tears at the very fabric of our nation.
It’s a challenge to our values -- and that means we have much work to do. We’ve got to tackle this head on. We have to be honest and clear about it. And we have to speak out. This is a moment when, as Americans, we have to truly listen to each other and learn from each other. And I believe it has to begin with a common understanding of some basic facts. And I express these facts, although they’d be obvious to many of the people in this place, because, unfortunately, it’s not facts that are communicated on a regular basis through our media.
The world’s 1.6 billion Muslims are as diverse as humanity itself. They are Arabs and Africans. They're from Latin America to Southeast Asia; Brazilians, Nigerians, Bangladeshis, Indonesians. They are white and brown and black. There’s a large African American Muslim community. That diversity is represented here today. A 14-year-old boy in Texas who’s Muslim spoke for many when he wrote to me and said, “We just want to live in peace.""
Back then, Muslims were often called Mahometans. And Thomas Jefferson explained that the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom he wrote was designed to protect all faiths -- and I’m quoting Thomas Jefferson now -- “the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and the Mahometan.""
Jefferson and John Adams had their own copies of the Quran. Benjamin Franklin wrote that “even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach to us, he would find a pulpit at his service."" So this is not a new thing.
Generations of Muslim Americans helped to build our nation. They were part of the flow of immigrants who became farmers and merchants. They built America’s first mosque, surprisingly enough, in North Dakota.  America’s oldest surviving mosque is in Iowa. The first Islamic center in New York City was built in the 1890s. Muslim Americans worked on Henry Ford’s assembly line, cranking out cars. AMuslim American designed the skyscrapers of Chicago.
In 1957, when dedicating theIslamic center in Washington, D.C., President Eisenhower said, “I should like to assure you, my Islamic friends, that under the American Constitution...and in American hearts...this place of worship, is just as welcome...as any other religion.""
And perhaps the most pertinent fact, Muslim Americans enrich our lives today in every way. They’re our neighbors, the teachers who inspire our children, the doctors who trust us with our health -- future doctors like Sabah. They’re scientists who win Nobel Prizes, young entrepreneurs who are creating new technologies that we use all the time. They’re the sports heroes we cheer for -— like Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon. And by the way, when Team USA marches into the next Olympics, one of the Americans waving the red, white and blue -- will a fencing champion, wearing her hijab, Ibtihaj Muhammad, who is here today. Stand up. I told her to bring home the gold. Not to put any pressure on you.
Muslim Americans keep us safe. They’re our police and our firefighters. They're in homeland security, in our intelligence community. They serve honorably in our armed forces -- meaning they fight and bleed and die for our freedom. Some rest in Arlington National Cemetery.
So Muslim Americans are some of the most resilient and patriotic Americans you’ll ever meet. We’re honored to have some of our proud Muslim American servicemembers here today. Please stand if you're here, so we can thank you for your service.
So part of the reason I want to lay out these facts is because, in the discussions that I was having with these incredibly accomplished young people, they were pointing that so often they felt invisible. And part of what we have to do is to lift up the contributions of the Muslim American community not when there’s a problem, but all the time.
Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security -- because -- it’s not that hard to do. There was a time when there were no black people on television. And you can tell good stories while still representing the reality of our communities.
Now, we do have another fact that we have to acknowledge. Even as the overwhelming majority -- and I repeat, the overwhelming majority -- of the world’s Muslims embrace Islam as a source of peace, it is undeniable that a small fraction of Muslims propagate a perverted interpretation of Islam. This is the truth.
Groups like al Qaeda and ISIL, they’re not the first extremists in history to misuse God’s name. We’ve seen it before, across faiths. But right now, there is a organized extremist element that draws selectively from Islamic texts, twists them in an attempt to justify their killing and their terror. They combine it with false claims that America and the West are at war with Islam. And this warped thinking that has found adherents around the world -- including, as we saw, tragically, in Boston and Chattanooga and San Bernardino -- is real. It’s there. And it creates tensions and pressure that disproportionately burden the overwhelming majority of law-abiding Muslim citizens.
And the question then is, how do we move forward together? How do we keep our country strong and united? How do we defend ourselves against organizations that are bent on killing innocents? And it can’t be the work of any one faith alone. It can’t be just a burden on the Muslim community -- although the Muslim community has to play a role. We all have responsibilities. So with the time I have left, I just want to suggest a few principles that I believe can guide us.
And so often, we focus on our outward differences and we forget how much we share. Christians, Jews, Muslims -- we’re all, under our faiths, descendants of Abraham. So mere tolerance of different religions is not enough. Our faiths summon us to embrace our common humanity. “O mankind,"" the Quran teaches, we have “made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another."" So all of us have the task of expressing our religious faith in a way that seeks to build bridges rather than to divide.
Second, as Americans, we have to stay true to our core values, and that includes freedom of religion for all faiths. I already mentioned our Founders, like Jefferson, knew that religious liberty is essential not only to protect religion but because religion helps strengthen our nation -- if it is free, if it is not an extension of the state. Part of what’s happened in the Middle East and North Africa and other places where we see sectarian violence is religion being a tool for another agenda -- for power, for control. Freedom of religion helps prevent that, both ways -- protects religious faiths, protects the state from -- or those who want to take over the state from using religious animosity as a tool for their own ends.
That doesn’t mean that those of us with religious faith should not be involved. We have to be active citizenry. But we have to respect the fact that we have freedom of religion.
Remember, many preachers and pastors fought to abolish the evil of slavery. People of faith advocated to improve conditions for workers and ban child labor. Dr. King was joined by people of many faiths, challenging us to live up to our ideals. And that civil activism, that civic participation that’s the essence of our democracy, it is enhanced by freedom of religion.
Now, we have to acknowledge that there have been times where we have fallen short of our ideals. By the way, Thomas Jefferson’s opponents tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim -- so I was not the first -- No, it’s true, it’s true. Look it up.  I’m in good company.
But it hasn’t just been attacks of that sort that have been used. Mormon communities have been attacked throughout our history. Catholics, including, most prominently, JFK -- John F. Kennedy -- when he ran for President, was accused of being disloyal. There was a suggestion that he would be taking orders from the Pope as opposed to upholding his constitutional duties. Anti-Semitism in this country has a sad and long history, and Jews were exclude routinely from colleges and professions and from public office.
And so if we’re serious about freedom of religion -- and I’m speaking now to my fellow Christians who remain the majority in this country -- we have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths. And when any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up. And we have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias, and targets people because of religion.
We’ve got to make sure that hate crimes are punished, and that the civil rights of all Americans are upheld. And just as faith leaders, including Muslims, must speak out when Christians are persecuted around the world -- or when anti-Semitism is on the rise -- because the fact is, is that there are Christians who are targeted now in the Middle East, despite having been there for centuries, and there are Jews who’ve lived in places like France for centuries who now feel obliged to leave because they feel themselves under assault --sometimes by Muslims. We have to be consistent in condemning hateful rhetoric and violence against everyone. And that includes against Muslims here in the United States of America.
So none of us can be silent. We can’t be bystanders to bigotry. And together, we’ve got to show that America truly protects all faiths.
Groups like ISIL are desperate for legitimacy. They try to portray themselves as religious leaders and holy warriors who speak for Islam. I refuse to give them legitimacy. We must never give them that legitimacy.They’re not defending Islam. They’re not defending Muslims. The vast majority of the people they kill are innocent Muslim men, women and children.
And, by the way, the notion that America is at war with Islam ignores the fact that the world’s religions are a part of who we are. We can’t be at war with any other religion because the world’s religions are a part of the very fabric of the United States, our national character.
So the best way for us to fight terrorism is to deny these organizations legitimacy and to show that here in the United States of America, we do not suppress Islam; we celebrate and lift up the success of Muslim Americans. That’s how we show the lie that they’re trying to propagate. We shouldn’t play into terrorist propaganda. And we can’t suggest that Islam itself is at the root of the problem. That betrays our values. It alienates Muslim Americans. It’s hurtful to those kids who are trying to go to school and are members of the Boy Scouts, and are thinking about joining our military.
That kind of mindset helps our enemies. It helps our enemies recruit. It makes us all less safe. So let’s be clear about that.
Now, finally, just as all Americans have a responsibility to reject discrimination -- I’ve said this before -- Muslims around the world have a responsibility to reject extremist ideologies that are trying to penetrate within Muslim communities.
Here at this mosque, and across our country and around the world, Muslim leaders are roundly and repeatedly and consistently condemning terrorism. And around the globe, Muslims who’ve dared to speak out have often been targeted and even killed. So those voices are there; we just have to amplify them more.
And it was interesting, in the discussion I had before I came out, some people said, why is there always a burden on us? When a young man in Charleston shoots African Americans in a church, there’s not an expectation that every white person in America suddenly is explaining that they’re not racist. They can Everybody is assumed to be horrified by that act. And I recognize that sometimes that doesn't feel fair.
But part of the answer is to make sure that the Muslim community in all of its variety, in all the good works that it’s doing, in all the talent that's on display, that it’s out there visible on a consistent basis -- not just at a certain moment.
But what is also true is, is that there is a battle of hearts and minds that takes place -- that is taking place right now, and American Muslims are better positioned than anybody to show that it is possible to be faithful to Islam and to be part of a pluralistic society, and to be on the cutting-edge of science, and to believe in democracy.
And so I would urge all of you not to see this as a burden, but as a great opportunity and a great privilege to show who you are. To use a little Christian expression -- let your light shine. Because when you do you’ll make clear that this is not a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam. This is a struggle between the peace-loving, overwhelming majority of Muslims around the world and a radical, tiny minority. And ultimately, I’m confident that the overwhelming majority will win that battle. Muslims will decide the future of your faith. And I’m confident in the direction that it will go.
But across the Islamic world, influential voices should consistently speak out with an affirmative vision of their faith. And it’s happening. These are the voices of Muslim clerics who teach that Islam prohibits terrorism, for the Quran says whoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind. These are the voices of Muslim scholars, some of whom join us today, who know Islam has a tradition of respect for other faiths; and Muslim teachers who point out that the first word revealed in the Quran -- igra -- means “read"" -- to seek knowledge, to question assumptions.
Muslim political leaders have to push back on the lie that the West oppresses Muslims, and against conspiracy theories that says America is the cause of every ill in the Middle East. Now, that doesn't mean that Muslim Americans aren’t free to criticize American -- U.S. foreign policy. That's part of being an American. I promise you, as the President of the United States, I’m mindful that that is a healthy tradition that is alive and well in America.  But like leaders everywhere, these leaders have been offering, and need to continue to offer, a positive vision for progress, and that includes political and economic progress.
And we have to acknowledge that much of the violence in places like the Middle East is now turning into fights between sects -- Shia, Sunni and others -- where differences are often exploited to serve political agendas, as I said earlier. And this bloodshed is destroying Muslim families and communities, and there has to be global pressure to have the vision and the courage to end this kind of thinking and this approach to organizing political power.
It’s not historically unique. It’s happened in every part of the world -- from Northern Ireland to Africa, to Asia, to right here in the United States -- in the past. But it is something that we have to fight against.
And we know it’s possible. Across the history of Islam, different sects traditionally have lived and thrived together peacefully. And in many parts of the world they do today, including here in the United States.
Like people of all religions, Muslims living their faith in a modern, pluralistic world are called upon to uphold human rights, to make sure that everyone has opportunity. That includes the aspirations of women and youth and all people. If we expect our own dignity to be respected, so must we respect the dignity of others.
So let me conclude by saying that as Muslim communities stand up for the future that you believe in, that you exhibit in your daily lives, as you teach your children, America will be your partner. We will -- I will -- do everything I can to lift up the multiplicity of Muslim voices that promote pluralism and peace. We will continue to reach out to young Muslims around the world, empowering them with science and technology and entrepreneurship, so they can pursue their God-given potential, and help build up their communities and provide opportunity. It’s why we will continue to partner with Muslim American communities -- not just to help you protect against extremist threats, but to expand health care and education and opportunity -- because that’s the best way to build strong, resilient communities.
Our values must guide us in this work. Engagement with Muslim American communities must never be a cover for surveillance. We can’t give in to profiling entire groups of people. There’s no one single profile of terrorists. We can’t securitize our entire relationship with Muslim Americans. We can’t deal with you solely through the prism of law enforcement. We’ve got to build trust and mutual respect. That’s how we’ll keep our communities strong and our communities united.
As I was in discussion with the young people before I came in here, I said this will be a process. Law enforcement has a tough job. Some of these groups are specifically trying to target Muslim youth. We’re going to have to be partners in this process. There will be times where the relationship is clumsy or mishandled. But I want you to know that from the President to the FBI Director, to everybody in law enforcement, my directive and their understanding is, is that this is something we have to do together. And if we don’t do it well, then we’re actually not making ourselves safer; we’re making ourselves less safe.
Don’t grow cynical. Don’t respond to ignorance by embracing a world view that suggests you must choose between your faith and your patriotism. Don’t believe that you have to choose between your best impulses and somehow embrace a world view that pits us against each other -- or, even worse, glorifies violence. Understand your power to bring about change. Stay engaged in your community. Help move our country forward -- your country forward.
We are blessed to live in a nation where even if we sometimes stumble, even if we sometimes fall short, we never stop striving for our ideals. We keep moving closer to that more perfect union. We’re a country where, if you work hard and if you play by the rules, you can ultimately make it, no matter who you are or how you pray. It may not always start off even in the race, but here, more than any place else, there’s the opportunity to run that race.
And as we go forward, I want every Muslim American to remember you are not alone. Your fellow Americans stand with you -- just as Sabah described her friends after she decided that she was going to start wearing a hijab. That’s not unusual. Because just as so often we only hear about Muslims after a terrorist attack, so often we only hear about Americans’ response to Muslims after a hate crime has happened, we don’t always hear about the extraordinary respect and love and community that so many Americans feel.
I’m thinking about the seven-year-old boy in Texas who emptied his piggy bank to help a mosque that had been vandalized. Or all the faith communities that rallied around Muslim Americans after the tragedy in Chapel Hill. The churches and the synagogues standing shoulder-to-shoulder with their local mosques, including the woman carrying a sign saying “We love our Muslim neighbors."" Think of our men and women in uniform who, when they heard that a little girl was afraid because she’s a Muslim, sent her a message -- “I Will Protect You.""
I want every American to remember how Muslim communities are standing up for others, as well. Because right now, as we speak, there are Muslims in Kenya who saved Christians from terrorists, and Muslims who just met in Morocco to protect religious minorities, including Christians and Jews. The good people of this mosque helped this city move forward after the turmoil of last year. Muslim Americans across the country helped African American churches rebuild after arson.
Remember the Muslim Americans in Boston who reached out to victims of the Marathon bombing; the Muslim Americans across the country who raised money for the families of San Bernardino; the Muslim Americans in Chattanooga who honored our fallen servicemembers, one of them saying, “in the name of God, the God of Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, God bless our fallen heroes.""
We are one American family. We will rise and fall together. It won’t always be easy. There will be times where our worst impulses are given voice. But I believe that ultimately, our best voices will win out. And that gives me confidence and faith in the future.
After more than 200 years, our blended heritage, the patchwork quilt which is America, that is not a weakness, that is one of our greatest strengths. It’s what makes us a beacon to the world. It’s what led that mother who wrote to me -- the one who worries about her young daughter -- it led her to end her letter with hope, despite her fears. She said, “I still believe in one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""
May God's peace be upon you.
May God bless the United States of America.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
",Islamic Society of Baltimore Address,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamaislamicsocietybaltimore.htm
Colin Shepherd,United Kingdom,2019-05-24,"I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh Office, for coming to the House to take part in a debate on a very important subject for our part of the country. I am delighted to see in their places my hon. The fact that my hon. Friend the Minister of State also has the River Wye going through his constituency and therefore knows it very well gives me confidence that this subject will receive the attention that it deserves.
There is a poignant point that I want to make at this juncture. I received a letter from my late hon. I know how deeply he felt about this matter because the headwaters of the River Wye ran through his constituency.
Those who enjoy the competitive sport of rafting point with some hard-earned pride to the £50,000, plus, that they raise for so many deserving charities. Those who promote canoeing holidays on the Wye can point to the benefits accruing to the community by the development of the tourist trade. My hon. Friend the Minister of State knows very well that the Wye valley is world renowned in this respect. In addition, the community has an additional interest in the financial aspects of the Wye, in that the declining levels of fish caught, for whatever reasons, are leading to successful appeals against rateable values by fishery owners. It is not unlikely that within a short time ​ there will be a drop in rate income of about 50 per cent, which will leave another £80,000 to be borne by other ratepayers.
I heard nothing further until after I wrote again in January 1983, when I was told that counsel’s opinion was being sought and that progress was slow. However, I was assured by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary that he was pursuing the matter further with his officials.
I heard nothing further until I wrote again in March this year, when I was informed that in the light of counsel’s opinion the Welsh water authority was having to reconsider its application and decide what action it might need to take. I was also told that the Welsh water authority had commissioned the Middlesex polytechnic to report upon the uses of the River Wye by various recreational groups, and that it had decided to defer making any final decisions until it had considered that report.
What could have been described in 1981 as a routine evolutionary problem has, since last year, erupted into a major and potentially revolutionary problem. I refer to the advent of hovercrafting as a recreational activity on the River Wye. In 1984 six craft were launched from Hohne Lacey and travelled up and down the river from Ross-on-Wye to north of Hereford.
I have no doubt that from the hovercrafters’ point of view, it is an attractive place to exercise an excitingly new, advanced, technological recreation. Indeed, in the magazine of the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain it was described in glowing terms. For those who have hitherto utilised the river with quiet enjoyment, this has caused consternation. It became clear to them that the craft were extremely noisy—their drivers wear ear muffs—that they disturb the river and its banks, and I have heard reports that salmon fry have been washed up and left high and dry on the banks. The craft are a serious potential danger to other river users.
It has been observed that, when operating at low speed, the wash is substantial and does not appear to lessen at all until speeds of 20 knots are reached. I dread to think of the hazard to a wading angler or a novice canoeist. The anglers point out that there is frequently a drastic reduction of the swan population where there is an abundance of noisy, powered craft, and they stress that the healthy population of swans on the Wye is, in all probability, due to the absence of powered craft along great stretches of it.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds points out that the Wye carries a number of important breeding colonies of kingfishers, dippers and, as my hon. Friend is probably aware, in recent years we have been privileged to see the return of peregrine falcons breeding at Symonds Yat, not a mile from my home. All of those would not lake kindly to an abundance of hovercraft. In addition, farmers ​ and fishermen alike are concerned about the prospect of oil pollution—something not so far experienced on the Wye, one of the cleanest rivers in the country.
Almost more alarming than anything else was the unco-operative attitude of hovercraft drivers on their first run, who were reported by anglers of the Hereford and District Anglers Association to have had complete disregard for anglers and their tackle. A grain of encouragement can be drawn from the revised stance of the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain, which has indicated that in the light of the present consternation it will not now be organising the proposed weekend expeditions on the Wye this year, and that it does not wish to be seen to operate in such a manner as to be a danger to other users of the river or, indeed, its members.
I welcome that wholeheartedly, but I must reflect with some caution that the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain is but a proprietors’ club, interested in promoting hovercrafting. It has no regulatory controls over hovercrafting or over its members or non-members.
We therefore must come to terms with this new situation that has arisen in respect of the River Wye. The door to hovercrafting on the Wye has been shown to be wide open, and it is an activity that is fundamentally inimical to the River Wye as a site of special scientific interest, as an area of outstanding natural beauty and as a recreational asset to so many activities based, as I have said before, on quiet enjoyment. We need to know the precise position concerning navigation on the Wye. I have grave disquiet about the referral of the problem by the Welsh water authority to the Middlesex polytechnic. It has all the hallmarks of a delaying tactic — a kicking for touch, a playing for time. I do not think that that time exists.
Despite the assurances of the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain, the threat of hovercrafting will not go away by itself. Regardless of what the Middlesex polytechnic reports, progress towards resolution of today’s problems will have to be based upon the present legal situation. A clear exposition of that position may well give rise to the kind of lateral thought necessary to achieve a satisfactory and fair reconciliation of conflicting interests, and allay the reasonable concerns of many people and organisations.
Finally, I should like a reassurance that there will be an opportunity to enable all interested parties to put their points of view openly before any change is made, as was promised to me in 1981. I think that we owe this to all the interests on the River Wye. If this can be done, I know that it will be appreciated. I think that it will be helpful for the longer term evolution of the quiet enjoyment of the River Wye for many people.
",1985 Speech on the River Wye,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/colin-shepherd-1985-speech-on-the-river-wye/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-08-22,"What a crowd. And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you. A lot of people in here, a lot of people pouring right now. They can get them in. Whatever you can do, fire marshals, we'll appreciate it.
And I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, for the introduction. As well as my friend Dr. Ben Carson. And thank you to a very, very special man, Franklin Graham, Reverend Franklin Graham, for leading us in prayer. And thank you too Alveda King, the niece of the great Dr. Martin Luther King.
It really shows you that America is indeed a nation of faith, we know that. Well, I'm thrilled to be back in Phoenix, in the great state of Arizona. With so many thousands of hard-working American patriots.
You know I'd love it if the cameras could show this crowd, because it is rather incredible. It is incredible. It is incredible. As everybody here remembers, this was the scene of my first rally speech, right?
The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there's something special happening here. And we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates. We love those debates.
But we went to center stage and we never left, right? All of us, we did it together. You were there at the start. You've been there every single day since, and I will never forget.
Believe me, Arizona, I will never forget. And I'm here tonight to send a message: We are fully and totally committed to fighting for our agenda, and we will not stop until the job is done. This evening, joined together with friends, we reaffirm our shared customs, traditions and values.
We love our country. We celebrate our troops. We embrace our freedom. We respect our flag. We are proud of our history. We cherish our Constitution, including, by the way, the Second Amendment. We believe in law and order. And we support the incredible men and of law enforcement.
And we pledge our allegiance to one nation under God. You always understood what Washington, D.C. did not. Our movement is a movement built on love. It's love for fellow citizens. It's love for struggling Americans who've been left behind, and love for every American child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true.
From the inner cities to the rural outposts, from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt, from east to west and north to south, our movement is built on the conviction that every American from every background is entitled to a government that puts their needs first.
It is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great American workers deserve, and that's what we're doing.
After our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women -- remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election? Guess what? They're not forgotten... anymore, right? Anymore.
No, they're not forgotten anymore folks. In fact, they're trying to figure you out. They're saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us? I don't think that's going to happen any time soon. We believe that every American has the right to live with dignity.
Respect for America demands respect for all of its people. Loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, We all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future. A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.
You saw last night. You saw last night. Did anybody watch last night? Yes. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one American suffers an injustice, all of America suffers together. We're all together.
It's time for us to follow the example of our brave American soldiers. And I was with a lot of them last night, Fort Myers. No matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team.
That's what we are. We're a team. As a nation, we're a team. They're all united by their devotion to our country and to their mission. It's time for all of us to remember that we are all on the same team. We are all Americans, and we all believe right now in America first.
And it's happening, and it's happening fast. I see all those red hats and white hats. It's all happening very fast. It's called ""Make America Great Again."" You see what's going on. It's coming back, very fast. We want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling American to have a chance for a better life.
What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America. And tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence. But the very dishonest media, those people right up there with all the cameras.
So the -- and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories. They have no sources in many cases. They say ""a source says"" -- there is no such thing.
But they don't report the facts. Just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the White Supremacists, and the KKK. I openly called for unity, healing and love, and they know it because they were all there.
So what I did -- So what I did is I thought, I'd take just a second, and I'm really doing this more than anything else, because you know where my heart is, OK? I'm really doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.
So here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville -- and I have a home in Charlottesville, a lot of people don't know. Here's the first -- can't believe they haven't figured that one out yet.
Now they know. Now they finally know. But I -- I just -- I don't want to bore you with this, but I -- it shows you how dishonest they are. And most of you know this anyway. So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday: ""We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia"" -- this is me speaking.
We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence."" That's me speaking on Saturday. Right after the event. So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, ""egregious display,"" ""hatred, bigotry and violence."" OK, I think I can't do much better, right? OK. But they didn't want to put this on.
They had it on initially, but then one day he talked -- he didn't say it fast enough. He didn't do it on time. Why did it take a day? He must be a racist.
It took a day. So here is -- here is me -- I hope they're showing how many people are in this room, but they won't.
They don't even do that. The only time they show the crowds is when there's a disrupter or an anarchist in the room. I call them anarchists.
Because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists. They don't want to talk about the anarchists. So this is me -- ""it has no place in America."" I'm talking about hatred, bigotry and violence.
It has no place in America. What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives. No citizen should ever fear for their safety, security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time. This is me speaking.
Here's further. This is on Saturday, the first one. I did this three times. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for the nation and true affection, really"" -- and I say this so strongly -- ""true affection for each other."" I didn't say true affection for you and you. I said for each other, all of us. All of us.
All of us. But they don't report it. They don't -- they just let it go. ""Above all else, we must remember this truth, no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first. We love our country, we love our God, and we love our flag.
And then I went on, this is my first statement, and they said, remember they said, well, he wasn't specific enough. Why wasn't he more specific? So in my second statement, I got really specific, and they said, why didn't he do it faster? The -- I'm telling you folks, look, look, I know these people probably better than anybody.
And a lot of people have a problem with it, because look, what happens with them, if they're doing a story about me, I know if it's honest or false. If you're reading a story about somebody, you don't know. You assume it's honest, because it's like the failing New York Times, which is like so bad.
It's so bad. Or CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.
But all the networks -- I mean, CNN is really bad, but ABC this morning -- I don't watch it much, but I'm watching in the morning, and they have little George Stephanopoulos talking to Nikki Haley, right? Little George. And -- and he talks about the speech I made last night, which believe it or not, got great reviews, right?
They had a hard time. They were having a hard time because it was with soldiers, we were somber, we were truthful, we were doing -- we were saying things -- and it really did.
So, he talked about it for like that much, then he goes, ""Let's get back to Charlottesville."" Charlottesville. And Nikki was great. She's doing a great job, by the way.
So now, I say we have to heal our wounds and the wounds of our country. I love the people of our country, the people, all of the people. It says I love all of the people of our country.
I didn't say I love you because you're black, or I love you because you're white, or I love you because you're from Japan, or you're from China, or you're from Kenya, or you're from Scotland or Sweden. I love all the people of our country. So, I said here's my -- this is -- by the way folks, this is my exact words: ""I love all the people of our country.
We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make it great for all of the people of the United States of America."" And then they say, is he a racist? Is he a racist? Then, I did a second one. So then I did a second one. Don't bother, it's only a single voice.
And not a very powerful voice. How did he get in here? He's supposed to be with the few people outside. How about -- how about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside.
Where are they? Well, it's hot out. It is hot. I think it's too warm.
You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything -- Antifa! So on August the 14th -- so that was it, and I said all people, I love all people, everything, right?
Now I figure I'm going to do it again. I'll be even more specific. So I said, based on the events that took place over the last weekend in Charlottesville, I'd like to provide the nation with an update.
Because that was right after the event, the first one, right? An update on ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everybody. To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable, justice will be delivered. That's what I said.
Listen to that, I said that, but they don't show that. They don't show it. They take -- they'll take one thing, like, seriously, he was late was the best thing.
He was late. So I said, to anyone who acted criminally in this weekends racists violence. OK, then I go, we must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.
We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans, right? Then I said, racism is evil. Do they report that I said that racism is evil? You know why? Because they are very dishonest people. So I said, racism is evil.
Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am.
But, I mean do you ever see anything -- and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings. Because they're putting like seven people all negative on Trump.
And they fired Jeffrey Lord, poor Jeffrey. Jeffrey Lord. I guess he was getting a little fed up, and he was probably fighting back a little bit too hard.
They said, we've better get out of here; we can't have that. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as Americans.
Now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness? And you know I mention that, but to the best of my knowledge when there was a big problem, Barack Obama never said it took place because of radical Islamic terrorists, he never said that, right.
He doesn't have to say... Because they have a double standard. Because the media is totally dishonest, and they have a double standard.
You never heard them say that. And in fact, if you use the term you'd get criticized. But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it.
And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on. ""Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike the very core of America."" These are my words. This was on Monday, August 14th.
So you had Saturday; you had Monday. You know, I was going to do one of these every week, but you would never get it right. ""In times such as these, America has always shown its true character.
Responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice."" And then I finished, I said, ""We will defend or protect the sacred rights of all Americans."" All is capitalized times five. Not just you.
And we will work together so that every citizen -- every citizen is free to follow their dreams and their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls. OK now, I mean -- so they were having a hard time with that one, because I said everything.
I hit him with neo-Nazi. I hit them with everything. I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi.
I got them all in there, let's say. KKK, we have KKK. I got them all.
So they're having a hard time. So what are they say, right? It should have been sooner. He's a racist.
It should have been sooner, OK. So it should have been -- so then the last one, on Tuesday -- Tuesday I did another one: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.
It has no place in America."" But they also said that he must be a racist because he never mentioned the driver of the car, who is a terrible person, drove the car and he killed Heather, and it's a terrible thing.
But they said I didn't mention, so these are my words. ""The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing."" They said I didn't mention it. And then they asked me, just to finish it, they asked me, what about race relations in the United States? Now I have to say they were pretty bad under Barack Obama, that I can tell you.
But, they asked me the question. And I said, well, I think jobs can have a very big and positive impact. I think if we continue to create jobs like I've done -- over one million since I've been in office...
Way over one million. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. I do.
I do. And the other thing -- very important -- I believe wages will start going up, because we now have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in 17 years, so you're going to see wages go up, right? They haven't gone up for a long time.
I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up, and I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.
So that was my words. Now, you know, I was a good student. I always hear about the elite.
You know, the elite. They're elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were.
I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great. I think -- you know what? I think we're the elites. They're not the elites.
So the point is -- and I didn't want to bore you, because you understand where I'm coming from. You people understand. But the point is, that those were three different -- there were two statements and one news conference.
The words were perfect. They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don't put on those words.
And they don't put on me saying those words. The media can attack me. But where I draw the line is when they attack you, which is what they do.
When they attack the decency of our supporters. You are honest, hard-working, taxpaying -- and by the way, you're overtaxed, but we're going to get your taxes down. You're taxpaying Americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people.
It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions, and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions. And yes, by the way -- and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage. You see that. We're all, like, we have a certain sense. We're smart people.
These are truly dishonest people. And not all of them. Not all of them.
You have some very good reporters. You have some very fair journalists. But for the most part, honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people.
And I really think they don't like our country. I really believe that. And I don't believe they're going to change, and that's why I do this.
If they would change, I would never say it. The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news. Oh, that's so funny.
Look back there, the live red lights. They're turning those suckers off fast out there. They're turning those lights off fast.
Like CNN. CNN does not want its falling viewership to watch what I'm saying tonight, I can tell you. I mean, the advantage I have -- the advantage I have is that we do have a big voice.
And you know, they're always saying, like Twitter or social media -- if I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be able to get the word out. I probably wouldn't be standing here, right? I probably wouldn't be standing here right now. If I don't have social media, I probably would not be standing.
And do you ever notice, when I go on and I'll put, like, out a tweet or a couple of tweets, ""He's in a Twitter-storm again!"" I -- I don't do Twitter-storms. You know, you'll put out a little tweet: ""I'm going to be with the veterans today."" They'll say, ""Donald Trump is in a Twitter-storm.""
These are sick people. You know the thing I don't understand? You would think -- you would think they'd want to make our country great again, and I honestly believe they don't.
I honestly believe it. If you want to discover the source of the division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth. I mean, the New York Times has written some stories.
How about this? The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did. They say, well, it wasn't really that much of an apology.
Because they were losing so many people, because they were misled. And I figured, this is great. And for about two weeks I got good coverage.
Then they reverted back into worse than ever before. You know, it's like one of those things. The Washington Post is terrible.
But these are dishonest -- but let me tell you, you have some great, honest papers. You have some great networks. I must tell you, Fox has treated me fairly.
Fox treated me fairly. They've treated me fairly. Hey, I'll let you know.
You know what? Some day they might not treat me fairly, and I'll tell you about it, OK? But they've treated me fairly, and I don't mean all good. I get plenty of bad on Fox, too. But at least it's within reason.
And Hannity? How good is that? How good is Hannity? And he's a great guy, and he's an honest guy. And ""Fox and Friends in the Morning"" is the best show, and it's the absolute, most honest show, and it's the show I watch. Not only does -- oh boy, those cameras are going off.
Oh, wow. Why don't you just fold them up and take them home? Oh, those cameras are going off. Wow.
That's the one thing, they're very nervous to have me on live television, because this can happen. Now, you know what? I'm a person that wants to tell the truth. I'm an honest person, and what I'm saying, you know is exactly right.
Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should've never been allowed to be politicians.
And the unaccountable hostility against our incredible police, who work so hard at such a dangerous job. My administration is committed to the idea that all Americans have the right to live in safety, security and peace.
We believe in the rule of law, because we know that freedom cannot exist if our people are not safe. And how safe are you at a Trump rally? Remember at the beginning, remember when this already started? When this started at the beginning, they used to send in thugs. They had -- our people are tougher than them, so it wasn't always very good for them.
But they'd send in thugs, and our people would protect themselves, and then you'd go home and you'd watch this violence. Let me tell you, see this room? You've got people outside, but not very many. But see this room? You're safe in this room.
You're very safe in this room. It's a big room. The most sacred duty of government is to protect the lives of its citizens, and that includes securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws.
By the way, I'm just curious. Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe? So, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? That's why... He should have had a jury, but you know what? I'll make a prediction.
I think he's going to be just fine, OK? But -- but I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy. Is that OK? All right? But Sheriff Joe can feel good. The people of Arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration, the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking.
MS-13 -- we're throwing them out so fast, they never got thrown out of anything like this. We are liberating towns out on Long Island. We're liberating.
Can you imagine, in this day and age -- in this day and age in this country, we are liberating towns. This is like from a different age. We are taking these people.
They don't shoot people, because it's too fast and not painful. They cut them up into little pieces. These are animals.
We are getting them out of here. We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country. We're liberating our towns.
You're seen it. You've lived it, and you elected me to put a stop to it. And we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it.
That I can tell you. After years of defending other countries borders -- can you believe we fight for other countries; we want to defend their borders -- we're finally defending our own borders. And we're showing compassion for these struggling American workers who are now starting to see the light because plants are coming pouring back into our country.
And by the way, we're doing a lot of good work on that, but a lot of people are coming back in. We have Foxconn, they make the iPhones, as you know, for Apple, and so many companies are building now in our country. Including the auto companies who are coming back.
Years of uncontrolled immigration have placed enormous pressure on the jobs and wages of working families, and they've put great burdens on local schools and hospitals.
While this may be good for a handful of special interests, it's unfair to working people of all backgrounds all throughout our country. We want every American community to succeed, including our immigrant communities, but they can't do that if we don't control our borders.
Earlier today, I visited with the incredible men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol during a visit to Yuma Sector. I was over at the Yuma Sector. It was hot.
It was like 115 degrees. I'm out signing autographs for an hour. I was there.
That was a hot day. You learn if you're in shape if you can do that, believe me. And they actually told me -- actually, sir, it's relatively cool today.
Can you believe that. And I met with the Border Patrol and I met with ICE, and these are incredible people; the job they do. And in fact, General Kelly, who was in charge of Homeland Security, where people coming in down 78 and almost 80 percent.
He did so good, I made him my chief of staff, right? That made sense. John, where's John? Where is he? Where's General Kelly? Get him out here. He's great.
He's doing a great job. But we did a lot before anything happened, we did a lot. We respect and cherish our ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents, and we respect and cherish our police officers, and our firemen, and all of our uniform services.
But during that visit, I heard first hand from the frontline agents about the security threats they confront each and every day, and I pledged my continued resolve to them, and all of you, to keep our country safe.
All around the nation, I have spent time with the wonderful Americans whose children were killed for the simple reason that our government failed to enforce our immigration laws, already existing laws. And I promised these families, the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain.
I promised them. I know so many of them. One by one we are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people.
We are throwing them out of the country or we're putting the hell, fast in jail. We are cracking down on these sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens, finally. And we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary.
Build that wall. Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it. But believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.
Let me be very clear to Democrats in Congress who oppose a border wall and stand in the way of border security: You are putting all of America's safety at risk. You're doing that. You're doing that.
Again, the Border Patrol today, I said, how important is the wall to some of the folks? I met with a lot of them. And they looked at me, they said, it's vital. It's vital.
It's so vital. And you know, we have walls. I don't know if you know, we're already starting to fix a lot of the walls we already have, because we don't have to rebuild them.
And we want walls that you can see through in a sense. You want to see what's on the other side. But we're starting to fix a lot of the walls.
We've done a lot of work. But I said to them, how are we doing and how important are the walls? And they said, Mr. President, you have no idea.
It is desperately needed. We're going to have our wall. We're going to get our wall.
And that wall is also going to help us, very importantly, with the drug problem, and the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring across the southern border. My administration will never back down in demanding immigration control. The American people voted for immigration control.
That's one of the reasons I'm here, and that is what the American people deserve, and they're going to get it. So you put pressure, but believe me, one way or the other, we're going to get that wall. Immigration security is also a matter, remember this, of national security.
That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places. Nope.
We're really vetting. We're tough.
That's what it has to be. So I have a message for Congress tonight: You're job is to represent American families, American people, American workers. That's your job.
You need to represent them on the border, on taxes, on healthcare -- one vote -- and on every other issue that affects their lives. And for our friends in the Senate, oh boy -- the Senate, remember this -- look, the Senate, we have to get rid of what's called the filibuster rule; we have to. And if we don't, the Republicans will never get anything passed.
You're wasting your time. We have to get rid of the filibuster rule. Right now, we need 60 votes and we have 52 Republicans.
That means that eight Democrats are controlling all of this legislation. We have over 200 bills.
And I want to tell you, we have some great, great Republican senators. We really do, and they fought like hell to get that thing approved. They fought.
They really did. They really fought. Now, even on healthcare, because of reconciliation, which, if you don't know, it doesn't matter.
It's a trick. We needed 51 votes. But when you need 51, and you have 52, and we include the vice president, who always votes with us.
He's the greatest. But you have no margin. But some of the best things in healthcare require 60 votes.
So even when you say we're voting on healthcare, like across state lines, purchase across state lines. One of the most important things, I've been talking about it for two years during debates. It gives competition.
Insurance companies come in, your prices go way down. Arizona is a disaster in terms of the price increase of your insurance, 116 percent interest. You got to get rid of the filibuster rule.
You've got to go to a majority. You've got to go to 51 votes, and if they don't do that they're -- they're just wasting time. All of the Democrats in Congress, that's the only thing they do well.
They do one thing well. You know what it's called? They have no ideas. They have no policies.
They obstruct. That's all they do. They're word is, we resist.
They don't resist; they obstruct. It's all they're good at. It's all they're good at.
That's all they do. On healthcare, they have 48 Democrats. We got no votes.
We got no votes. And it would have been great healthcare. And by the way, would have been great healthcare for Arizona.
Would have been great. So the Democrats have no ideas, no policy, no vision for the country other than total socialism and maybe, frankly, a step beyond socialism from what I'm seeing.
Under they're plan for America, your taxes will double or triple, your service will diminish and your borders will be left wide open for everybody to come in and enjoy our country.
Obamacare is a disaster and think -- think, we were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming repeal and replace. One vote away. One vote away.
We were one vote away. Think of it, seven years the Republicans -- and again, you have some great senators, but we were one vote away from repealing it.
President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr. President don't mention any names. So I won't.
I won't. No I won't vote -- one vote away, I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isn't' it? Very presidential.
And nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who's weak on borders, weak on crime, so I won't talk about him. Nobody knows who the hell he is.
And now -- see, I haven't' mentioned any names. So now, everybody's happy. But we are going to get rid of Obamacare.
I will never stop -- one vote -- I will never stop. We're going to get rid of Obamacare. Every day we're keeping our promises, and that includes our promises to our great, great veterans.
Who's a veteran here? It's getting better, getting really good. Nobody's fixed it -- nobody's been able to do it. And remember, I'm only here for less than eight months, you know.
When they talk about Obamacare, it was years. When they talk Hillary Clinton spent eight years trying to get... It's pretty obvious. And we won it by a lot. And I hear we're winning it by even more right now.
But if you think about it, Clinton, they spent eight years that they weren't able to get health care. Other administrations spent all of their time, they weren't able to get it. Obama, what he did to get it.
What he did to get it, including the guy, Gruber. Did you see Gruber got fired yesterday? He got fired because he defrauded somebody or something. Something very bad happened.
Check it out. Something happened. Gruber, who lied about Obamacare, who called everybody fools for believing it.
Obamacare is gone. It's a disaster. It's gone.
Premiums in other states are going up in numbers that are even higher than the state of Arizona. Insurance companies are fleeing, and it's gone. So we're going to -- I really believe that the Republicans -- and maybe we'll get a couple of senators that think they're going to lose their race on the Democratic side, maybe, but we'll get it fixed.
One vote -- speak to your Senator, please. Speak to your Senator. We're reforming the V.A.
to ensure our veterans have the care they so richly deserve, including choice -- choice -- choice. In other words, if you've got to wait for seven days and you're not feeling well, you go see a doctor and we pay for your doctor. Isn't that good? And we've got legislation approved that everybody said was impossible.
It's called V.A. Accountability. If somebody treats our veterans badly, we can fire them.
We say you're fired; get out of here. Everybody said -- everybody said you couldn't get that -- they've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. We got great legislation.
You ever hear of these liars back there, where they say, but Trump hasn't gotten -- I think we've gotten more in a short period of time, in this seven months,
I think we've gotten more than anybody, including Harry Truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we've got none. So we got V.A. Accountability so that you can fire people that are treating our veterans badly or aren't doing their jobs.
Isn't that great? We've also obtained historic increase in defense spending to prevent and deter conflict. We believe in peace through strength. We're building up our military like never before.
Thousands and thousands of brave Americans have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. Now it's up to us to preserve and protect their legacy. Last night, as you know, I laid out my vision for I'm honorable and enduring outcome in a very tough place, a place where country has failed, Afghanistan.
This is the place where terrorists are trained, where you have people that are not exactly United States fans, can I say that? And I will tell you then what we're going to do with our incredible military, they're going to make unbelievable sacrifices, and they've already made, in some cases, the ultimate sacrifice.
But we're fighting for them. Our warfighters deserve the tools they need, and the trust they've earned to fight and to win.
Fight and to win. And you see what's going on in North Korea. All of a sudden, I don't know -- who knows.
But I can tell you, what I said, that's not strong enough. Some people said it's too strong, it's not strong enough. But Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us.
I respect that fact very much. Respect that fact. And maybe -- probably not -- but maybe something positive can come about.
They won't tell you that, but maybe something positive can come about. Every American deserves a government that protects them, honors them, defends them, and fights for them.
And by the way, speaking of that, you have three congressman in the audience and your governor who met me at the plane, and he's now inside, but he said I want to spend my time outside on security.
I said, I think that's a great idea, governor. But not that many people showed up so I don't think it should be much of a problem. But you have a hell of a governor, Governor Ducey.
You have a great governor. And we have three congressman, a friend of mine who has been so great to me, Trent Franks. Where is Congressman Franks? Where is he? Get over here.
Paul Gosar, Congressman, Congressman Andy Biggs. Get up here, fellow. Thank you, fellows.
Thank you, congressman. Never let them go, folks. Never let them go.
Don't ever lose them. Thank you, fellows. So, in Washington, we're taking power out of the hands of donors and special interests, and putting that power back into the hands of the people that voted for us, OK? For us.
The same failed voices in Washington who opposed our movement are the same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another; who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another; who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs. We don't need advice from the Washington, D.C. swamp.
We need, right now, to drain the swamp. That's what's happening, too, believe me. Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.
But I don't come to Washington for me. You know, I've had a great life. I've had great success.
I've enjoyed my life. Most people think I'm crazy to have done this. And I think they're right.
But I enjoy it, because we've made so much -- I don't believe that any president -- I don't believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months. I really don't believe it. Including -- including a great Supreme Court justice, Justice Gorsuch.
. I came to Washington for you. Your dreams are my dreams.
Your hopes are my hopes. And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day. It's so important.
Our agenda is the pro-worker agenda. We've accomplished historic amounts in a short period of time. We've signed more than 50 pieces of legislation.
They said we've signed none -- none. We've signed 50; appointed Justice Gorsuch; nominated 31 new federal judges, with many more on the way. So, importantly, we have aggressively canceled job-killing regulations, and we're unleashing job-creating American energy like we've never unleashed before.
We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and it's just been announced that a second, brand-new coal mine, where they're going to take out clean coal -- meaning, they're taking out coal.
They're going to clean it -- is opening in the state of Pennsylvania, the second one. And the state of West Virginia, which was way behind and lagging, was now, in terms of GDP increase, second last quarter to the state of Texas.
How about that? West Virginia. And they have a great governor in West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice, who just quit the Democrats and joined the Republican Party. In the proud tradition of America's great leaders, from George Washington -- please, don't take his statue down, please.
Please. Does anybody want George Washington's statue? No. Is that sad? Is that all sad? To Lincoln, to Teddy Roosevelt, I see they want to take Teddy Roosevelt's down, too.
They're trying to figure out why. They don't know. They're trying to take away our culture.
They are trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years.
You go back to a university, and it's gone. Weak, weak people. We are going to protect American industry.
We are going to protect the American worker. No longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth. We are building our future with American hands, American labor, American iron, aluminum, and steel.
We will buy American, and we will hire American. I immediately withdrew the United States from the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would have been a disaster.
And you know, that one of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into. We have begun formal renegotiation with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA. And I must be honest, and I've been talking about NAFTA for a long time, and I'm sorry it's taken six months, but we have to give notice.
You have to see this. We have to give notice, and after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time. Then you have to give another one, then you have to wait a long time.
Anyway, we started two days ago, Bob Lighthizer. Personally, I don't think we can make a deal, because we have been so badly taken advantage of/ They have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular, Mexico, that I don't think we can make a deal. So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK? Probably.
But -- but I told you from the first day, we will renegotiate NAFTA, or we will terminate NAFTA. I personally don't think you can make a deal without a termination, but we're going to see what happens, OK?
You're in -- you're in good hands, I can tell you. We are unleashing American energy, and I withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
People have no idea how bad that was for this country. Great for other countries. We were like the lap dog.
Great for other countries. Our country was so behind. Since I took the oath of office, we've added far more than one million jobs in the private sector.
Unemployment is, right now, at almost a 17-year low. Wages are rising. The stock market is at its all-time high in history, and economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent.
Remember, everybody said you won't bring it up to 1 percent. You won't bring it up to 1.2 percent. And we've just started.
Those regulations that we've gotten rid of, which -- and we're going to have some regulation, but it's going to be sensible regulation. Those regulations are unleashing our economy. So we have a GDP, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter: 2.6 percent.
Remember, I said we're going to try and hit 3 percent? We're already at 2.6. Maybe I'll have to increase my offer. And so many of those people, you know, the Economic Council? When it got a little heat with the lies from the media, they sort of said, Oh, we'll take a pass.
Not all of them, but some of them did. But I remember the ones that did. But they'll say, We take -- oh, we'll take -- but people are now calling me, people that have been, like, we'll take a pass -- Don, can we get together for lunch? Let's do it privately, instead of through a council.
These people just don't get it. They are calling, and they're saying, how about getting together privately? They like it better. Why should they be on a council? You know, that's the way it is, folks.
That's the way it is. To bring more jobs and industry to our shores, we are committed to passing the first major tax reform in over 30 years. Now, we need the help of Congress, please.
OK? We need the help of Congress. And we really could use some Democrat help. We're giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.
The Democrats are going to find a way to obstruct. If they do, remember, they are stopping from getting a massive tax cut. Just remember that, OK? America's crushing business tax is a massive, self-inflicted, economic wound.
We have one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, pushing jobs and wealth out of our country. That is why we are going to lower the tax on American business, to bring back those companies, bring them back to America. We want more products stamped with the letters, ""Made in the U.S.A."".
We also want everyday Americans to be able to keep more of their own money. So for the Democratic senators, especially the ones where I won their states by 20 and 30 points, I really hope you're going to come over to our side. Because again, when you have 52 Republicans, if you lose like two, that's the end.
You know what, as good as something is, it's hard to get 51 out of 52. So I hope some of the Democrats that are going to lose their election will come over and give everybody a big beautiful tax cut, which is going to be great for the economy. It's time to pass a tax cut for the middle-class families.
We will make America the best place in the world to hire, grow and start a business again. We want to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We're going to do an infrastructure bill.
We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land. Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life. American hands will build this future.
American energy will power this future. We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently. And American workers will bring this future to life.
We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, put a man on the moon, and defeated communism. We can do anything, we can build anything and we can dream anything. It's time to remember what our brave soldiers never forgot.
Americans share one flag, one home and one glorious destiny. We live according to the same law, raise our children by the same values, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
As long as we remember these truths, as long as we have enough strength and courage in ourselves, then there is no challenge too great, no task too large, no dream beyond our reach.
We are Americans, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. This is our moment.
This is our chance. This is our opportunity to recapture our dynasty like never before, to rebuild our future, to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in America. Freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, Arizona will thrive, and our beloved nation will succeed like never, ever before.
So to Americans young and old, near and far, in cities small and large, we say these words again tonight: We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again.
We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Arizona.
God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.
","Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Phoenix, Arizona",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-phoenix-arizona-august-22-2017
John Redwood,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"The constitutional treaty is part of a process to try and create a United Federal States of Europe. Indeed, it would not be that federal because there would be an enormous amount of central power coming from the Brussels machine. We as democrats object to it because the power is not properly democratically accountable.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a mighty cause that we must unite to fight. This is a vital cause if we want to keep our democracy in Britain, or if we want to recapture parts of our democracy that have already been lost, needlessly frittered away by an insouciant government that tells us one thing and does another.
This is a mighty test of British democracy itself. It goes to the very heart of the breaking of the bond of trust between a main political party and the people who elected it. The government promised and the government has failed to deliver. It goes to the very issue of whether you can believe politicians and political parties in general when you have so many senior politicians in this country seeking to tell you the fanciful, that this is not the constitution, that this is a very watered down version of the constitution, that there is nothing serious going on, that you will be able to carry on governing your own country in the usual democratic way after all these powers have been surrendered.
This is a government which is now dicing with the most important powers of the state of all. It is playing nonchalantly with the right of parliament and government in this country to decide if and when our forces should be committed to battle, what our foreign policy stance should be on the major problem areas of the world, how people should be charged with serious criminal offences and how they should be treated if they are found guilty of those criminal offences.
These are the very essence of state power. We here don’t think those powers have always been well used and sensibly used by this government, but what we want is to continue to live in a system where we can challenge the way the government of the day makes decisions over war and peace and criminal justice and foreign affairs, and where we are in the right to persuade the British people and come to power to do something differently.
What we wish to avoid is the British people ending up in a position where, because they don’t trust their politicians enough, and because some of their politicians so badly mislead them, we end up with those vital decisions taken way away from these shores by people we cannot elect, and more importantly, by people we cannot drum out of office when they do the wrong thing.
The one power that all parliamentarians seriously fear is the power of the British electorate to dismiss us when we get it wrong and when we misbehave and when we let you down.
I am a democrat to my core. I believe in that power. I believe I should be accountable to all my electors, and on national issues to the wider nation. I want that power the people have over their elected representatives to be strengthened, and I want the power my elected representatives have over the laws and the administration of this country also to be strengthened so the accountability can mean something. The more the power is transferred to the unelected and the unaccountable, the more people will scorn and despise government, the more that bond of trust will be irreparably broken, the more your democracy will be taken away from you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is vital we unite and fight. It is vital we use any general election forthcoming to make this one of the big issues of the day. It is vital we do not miss our opportunity. We fought them and won to save our pound. Now we need to fight them and win to save our country.
",2007 Speech to the Bruges Group,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/john-redwood-2007-speech-to-the-bruges-group/
David Cameron,United Kingdom,2015-11-20,"Two weeks ago, I spoke about this Government’s mission: to build an aspiration nation, where those who work hard can get on – and no one gets left behind. A stronger private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach.
Today I want to talk about another, critical, part of helping people to rise up and that is confronting the crime and bad behaviour that holds so many people down.
Go to some neighbourhoods in our country and you can feel that aspiration is dead. Children learning from a young age that life is about surviving, not thriving. Gang leaders as role models, drug dealers as career advisors. This doesn’t just matter to the elderly lady with five bolts on her door or the woman terrified to walk home in the dark. It matters to all of us.We will not rise as a country if we leave millions behind and write off whole communities.
So today I want to tell you about our approach to crime and justice – and the bold, unprecedented action we’re taking.
For many people, when it comes to crime I’m the person associated with those three words, two of which begin with ‘H’, and one of which is ‘hoodie’; even though I never actually said it. For others, I’m the politician who has argued frequently for tough punishment. So do I take a tough line on crime – or a touchy-feely one?
In no other public debate do the issues get as polarised as this. On climate change you don’t have to be in denial on the one hand or campaigning to get every car off the road on the other. Life isn’t that simple – so government policy isn’t that simple. And yet with the crime debate, people seem to want it black or white.
Lock ‘em up or let ‘em out. Blame the criminal or blame society. ‘Be tough’ or ‘act soft’.
We’re so busy going backwards and forwards we never move the debate on.
What I have been trying to do – in opposition and now in government – is break out of this sterile debate and show a new way forward: tough, but intelligent. We need to be tough because the foundation of effective criminal justice is personal responsibility.
Committing a crime is always a choice. That’s why the primary, proper response to crime is not explanations or excuses, it is punishment – proportionate, meaningful punishment.
And when a crime is serious enough, the only thinkable punishment is a long prison sentence. This is what victims – and society – deserve.
Victims need to know the criminal will be held to account and dealt with. And the ‘society’ bit really matters: retribution is not a dirty word, it is important to society that revulsion we all feel against crime is properly recognised. But punishment is what offenders both deserve and need, too. It says to them: “You are adults. Your actions have consequences.”
To treat criminals as victims – to say they had no choice – is to treat them like children. I firmly believe in their right to be treated as adults, with the responsibility to carry the consequences of their actions. But that’s not the whole story.
Just being tough isn’t a successful strategy in itself. Come with me to any prison in this country. There you’ll meet muggers, robbers, and burglars. But you’ll also meet young people who can’t read, teenagers addicted to drugs, people who’ve never worked a day in their whole lives.
These people need help so they can become part of the solution and not remain part of the problem. Recognising this isn’t soft, or liberal. It’s common sense.
We’ll never create a safer society unless we give people, especially young people, opportunities and chances away from crime. Prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime – everything else is simply picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before. That’s part of what I mean by being intelligent as well as tough.
Not just saying what people want to hear, not playing to the gallery, but thinking hard about dealing with the causes of crime as well as the fall-out. And today, being intelligent has got to mean something else too. Achieving our ambitions when there is much less money than there used to be. The politics of the blank cheque are well and truly over.
The only way to achieve our ambitions is reform – radical, intelligent reform. So much of what went wrong in public services previously wasn’t because the money was missing, it was because the methods were wrong.
Top-down, bureaucratic, centralising. Judging every service by the money you put in rather than by the service you got out.
Our whole reform agenda is about turning this on its head.
Going from big government to big society; more choice, more competition, more openness. You see it in welfare providers paid by results and hospitals publishing their results online.
Some say, this is fine in welfare, fine with hospitals or fine with schools, but it won’t work in criminal justice. They think when it comes to keeping people safe, we’ve got to stick with the old, state-heavy approach. I believe that’s wrong.
It was the old approach that gave us police stuck behind desks filling in forms. It left us with the criminal justice system chasing ridiculous, unhelpful targets. And it left us with sky-high re-offending rates.
So we are bringing the logic of our public service reform agenda – transparency, payment by results, accountability – to transform criminal justice too. Because every part of that system needs change. Every part needs tough, but intelligent reform.And today, I want to explain how that’s working, right through the criminal justice system.
Let’s start with the police. I am profoundly grateful for the job our police officers do.
Years ago I used to run near Wormwood Scrubs every morning, and on my route there was a small stone monument. It said: ‘Here fell PS Christopher Head; PC Geoffrey Fox; PC David Wombwell, 12th August 1966’; and it was a daily reminder of this single truth: Police officers put on their uniform in the morning, kiss their children goodbye, and leave home having no idea about the dangers they might face.
Just a few weeks ago, Police Constables Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone answered a 999 call without knowing where it would lead. And though PC Ian Dibell was off-duty, he too could not have imagined what he would come up against. These people were professional, brave, instinctively selfless. The same can be said of thousands of police officers who work on our streets, protecting our families day-in, day-out.
All of us owe them our thanks. All of us owe them our respect. And for all those who wear the uniform, it’s essential we get policing right. For years police officers were held back from doing the job they signed up for. We had targets like the ‘Offences Brought to Justice Target’ which encouraged police to chase easy wins.
I remember being out on the beat with a police officer in South Wales and he felt he had to book a boy for taking some money from his mum’s purse – rather than just a stiff talking to down at the nick. That’s what the culture and targets demanded. He knew it was ridiculous. Everyone knew it was ridiculous. But the targets forced his hand. And then there was the out-of-control bureaucracy.
Police officers spending almost half their shift on paperwork. So Theresa May is doing what so many Home Secretaries before her shied away from; fundamentally reforming the police and allowing them to get on with the tough, no-nonsense policing that they want and we want.
We’ve scrapped all the targets and given them a single, core objective – to cut crime.We’ve ended micro-management from Whitehall and returned professional discretion to local forces.
The notion that you had to fill out a form every time you stopped someone on the street – it’s gone.The endless looking up for instruction from some official in the Home Office – it’s over. And we’re going further; reforming police pay so it rewards crime-fighting, not just time served; and changing the leadership of the police too.
Our reforms are comprehensive, they are sophisticated – and they are working.
HMIC – the independent regulator – found that even at a time of tight budgets, the frontline is being protected. The number of neighbourhood police officers is up. Public satisfaction is up and crime is down. And if you like official figures, here they are.
Even though in real terms, central police spending cuts are around 20 per cent over four years, the latest figures – out at the end of last week – show that crime is down 6 per cent in the last year.
We can have tough policing when money is tight. And we’re bringing intelligent reform too. More accountability and transparency to put people in charge of policing. That’s what Police and Crime Commissioners are all about.
These are big, important elections coming up. It’s the first time they are being held. People are going to be voting in their own law and order champion: One person who sets the budgets; sets the priorities; hires and fires and Chief Constable; bangs heads together to get things done.
Some people are saying that no one’s bothered, that people aren’t interested in how we fight crime in their area. I don’t agree. I say look at crime maps and you come to a conclusion.
They said no one would care about transparency – but this website has had 500 million hits and counting.
The more high profile Police and Crime Commissioners get, the more engaged people will be – and the more pressure they’ll put on them to deliver tough local policing.
So my message for these elections is clear: If you want more tough policing, you can get it.If you want coppers who are on the beat, on your street, cracking down on anti-social behaviour, focussing on the things you care about, then don’t just talk about it, get out on November 15th and vote for it.Intelligent reform is happening at the national level too, with the National Crime Agency.
This is, if you like, Britain’s version of the FBI; recognising that there are some highly serious and organised crimes – human trafficking, money laundering, drug rings – that need the very best in terms of national co-ordination.
The next part of the criminal justice chain is prosecution and here again we need tough, but intelligent reform.
Too often the story’s the same. Someone gets arrested in the middle of the night. They’re bailed. It takes months before they appear in court. Then the day dawns and they’ve disappeared.
It’s why you get whole walls of police stations papered with pictures of people missing on bail. But we saw with the riots last summer it doesn’t have to be like that. Justice was swift and it was tough – and we want that all the time.
So we’re opening our courts earlier in the morning, in the evenings and weekends; because crime doesn’t keep normal working hours and neither should our criminal justice system. Already this is happening in 48 courts across the country.
Another innovation is video links between police stations and courts. If someone is arrested, the police can flick the switch on a monitor and get them in front of a magistrate in hours rather than months. So no bail to jump and no cracks to slip through.
And we need to toughen up the process in court too.
Today, once the verdict is passed, the defendant can stand in the witness box and make their case for a more lenient sentence; but too often the victim doesn’t get a say. The one person whose life has been torn apart is kept silent.
We want to give more victims the chance to be heard – to say how their life has been affected by the crime. And to back that up we will be appointing a new Victims’ Commissioner to make sure that victims’ voices are heard not just in court but right at the heart of government.
We need intelligent reform, too, to open up our whole justice system. Today it’s all too closed, opaque, unaccountable.
We hear second hand what sentence a criminal is getting. Wouldn’t it be better if we could hear and watch the result and the reasoning – directly?
So we are legislating to start televising the sentences that Judges deliver, so that people can hear why a decision has been reached directly from the Judge.
This will start in the Court of Appeal next year, and in the long-term we want to see this happening in the Crown Court too.
When those criminals are convicted, we need to make sure the punishment fits the crime. At every single level of sentence this Government is getting tougher.
Where fines used to be limited, with us magistrates will be able to impose unlimited fines. While the maximum compensation that criminals used to be liable for was £5000, we are uncapping it. If you cost someone £10,000 or £20,000, you should potentially have to pay that back.
And we are toughening up community sentences too.
Having a monthly meeting with your probation officer is hardly a punishment – so tomorrow in Parliament, something important is happening. We are laying amendments to the Crime and Courts Bill, making sure that every community sentence contains an element of punishment.
And this tough change is aligned with an intelligent reform.
We’re introducing new GPS satellite tagging that can pin-point exactly where offenders are. Making it literally impossible to duck under the radar.
If you’re on a community sentence, you will be supervised. You will be properly punished. And you will be forced to complete that sentence.Of course, for many crimes, only one form of punishment will do – and that is prison.
I want to be clear. I want to see people who ruin the lives of others – rapists, murderers, muggers – behind bars, and kept there for a long time.
I’ve always supported the principle of the life sentence.
You do something heinous – and for the rest of your life you are either in prison or on licence and subject to recall if you step out of line. I don’t believe that’s old-fashioned, it is vital, so we are increasing life sentences.
A new two strikes and you’re out rule means that if you commit two serious sexual or violent offences, you get life. Not at the Judge’s discretion – but mandatory life.
We are creating a new maximum sentence of life for those who import guns and death onto our streets. And we are looking too at toughening up knife sentences, because to me a caution for carrying a knife just does not seem enough.And for anyone sentenced to a spell in prison, there will be space in prison. There will be no arbitrary targets for our prison population.
The number of people behind bars will not be about bunks available, it will be about how many people have committed serious crimes.
Once they are inside prison, we’re toughening up the regime.
Too many prisoners see out their time by just lying on their beds for hours and hours, watching TV, doing nothing, learning nothing. So we are turning those prisons from places of idleness into places of work.
Like HMP Manchester, where prisoners work in the laundry or printing workshop for up to 40 hours a week. I saw myself today a number of programmes where it is possible for prisoners to work and earn.
This is about fit and able people getting out of their cells, having a structured day, earning respect and earning privileges. And when they earn money, we’ll be making them pay a chunk of it back to their victims too.
So on the punishment of criminals – I don’t want there to be any doubt that we will be tougher. But it’s not good enough just being tough, locking people up and thinking: that’s it.
We need to be intelligent too, about what happens to these people during and after their punishment. And here’s why.At the moment, six out of ten of those leaving jail are reconvicted within two years. If you think that figure’s depressing, try this.
While those in the care system account for just one per cent of children, a quarter of those in prison were in care as children.
Half the prison population say they have no qualifications. We have got to give these people a chance. Not just for their sake, but for ours. To stop that revolving door that sucks millions of pounds of public money in and spits thousands of unreformed offenders out.
We’ve tried just banging people up and it’s failed.
We’ve tried letting people out with £46 in their pocket and no help on the outside and guess what? They’ve gone back to their old ways.
So I’m not going to try and out-bid any other politician on toughness, saying “let’s just bang them up for longer, let’s have more isolation, and once they’re out they’re on their own.”
I say: let’s use that time we’ve got these people inside to have a proper positive impact on them, for all our sakes.
It’s not a case of ‘prison works’ or ‘prison doesn’t work’ – we need to make prison work. And once people are on the outside, we’ve got to stick with them, and give them proper support, because it’s not outer space we’re releasing these people into – it’s our streets, our towns, among our families and our children.
That’s why this Government is engaged in what can only be described as a rehabilitation revolution – led by the new Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.
His main, driving mission is this: to see more people properly punished, but fewer offenders returning to the system.
To achieve that, we’re saying to charities, companies and voluntary organisations – come and help us rehabilitate our prisoners. Give offenders new skills. Educate them.
If they’ve been in a gang, send a reformed gang member to meet them at the prison gates and take them under their wing. If they’re on drugs, try the latest techniques to get them clean.
Do whatever it takes to get these people back living decent, productive lives. We will pay you for that; but – and it is a major but – once again the payments will depend on results.
We’re going to pay people by the lives they turn around. Just think of what this means for the taxpayer.
With payment by results, your money goes into what works: prisoners going straight, crime coming down, our country getting safer.
It’s such a good idea I want to put rocket boosters under it; indeed today I have an announcement to make.
By the end of 2015, I want to see payment by results spread right across rehabilitation. Of course, there will be some high-risk offenders for whom this is not appropriate but this approach should be the norm rather than the exception. And I want to see rehabilitation reach more of those who would benefit from it.
Today, rehab just goes to those who have been inside for a year or more. But that misses all those who go in for shorter sentences yet re-offend time and time again. So I want to look at making them part of the rehabilitation revolution too.
I’ve touched on all the parts of the criminal justice chain, from policing to prison but where we need the most intelligent reform is prevention: stopping all this happening in the first place.
The riots last summer were a stark warning that parts of our society are broken. They told us we need to intervene much earlier in the story, before the jail cell, before the robbery, before the petty theft.
As the CSJ has argued so passionately, having a strong family is absolutely vital to people’s life chances and we believe that too. Strengthening families, strengthening partnerships, strengthening marriages, encouraging commitment are all part of our agenda.It’s why we’re shaking up fostering and adoption, ending the scandal that left children languishing in the care system for years.
It’s why we’ve re-focussed Sure Start centres – with more parenting classes, reaching out to the parents who really need support. And it’s why we’re bringing new help for the most 120,000 troubled families, the ones that live in a constant cycle of poverty, addiction and hopelessness.
For these families we’re bringing in professional, targeted help to get them into work, get the kids in school, help bring some order to their chaotic lives. And prevention means something else.
Some of those rioters last summer showed a complete indifference to the rules. We need to make clear to young people that respect is not something you can just expect, it’s something you earn.
So we’re bringing real discipline to schools – with teachers having more power to use reasonable force and take control of their classroom. And crucially, we’re focusing on those children who have been excluded from school.
Some Pupil Referral Units have been little more than a nursery class before the juvenile detention centre. So we’re turning failing PRUs into Academies, just as we are with failing schools, so that powerful, effective sponsors can bring the same radical improvements to them, as to some of the most challenged schools in the country.
On the other side of the coin we’re doing more to encourage good behaviour. National Citizen Service is about showing young people that they have responsibilities as well as rights, that they have a stake in our society.
Tens of thousands took part this year, and it is a personal passion of mine that in the coming years this should become a permanent part of the landscape in our country, a rite of passage that every teenager in every school goes through.
And all this fits into the bigger, broader picture of what this Government’s doing.
Whether it’s changing welfare so there’s no more something for nothing or putting the law on the side of victims and not criminals, we are re-scoring that line between right and wrong; between good behaviour and bad.
So I don’t want there to be any doubt how serious this Government is about law and order. Yes, we are tough – but we’re being intelligent too.
Not just giving police more power but giving people more power.
Not just speeding up our courts but opening them up.
Not just punishing but rehabilitating too.
By taking this approach we can cut crime even while cutting budgets. We can show law-abiding people that finally, the system is on your side.
And we can go to all those communities where life felt like a dead-end. Where crime felt inevitable; and we can restore hope and opportunity there too.
This is our goal. An aspiration nation. Where no one is left behind. And we are absolutely determined to achieve it.
",2012 Speech on Crime and Justice,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2012-speech-on-crime-and-justice/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-01-04,"Thank you very much. We had a very, very productive meeting, and I think we've come a long way. I'll discuss that in a second. But first, I imagine you've all seen the incredible job growth -- 312,000 jobs -- which took everybody by surprise. And this really took people by surprise.
This is a great number. I think it has a lot to do with the factories and with the companies that are moving back into the United States, who have left, and now they're coming back to us instead of being in other countries. I can't tell you what that does to other countries, but I'm the President of this country.
So 312,000 jobs was a tremendous number, and obviously having a big impact on the stock market today. And I do want people to remember that we've had a tremendous success, despite the fact that I'm in the midst of negotiating incredible trade deals for our country that should have been negotiated many years ago -- by both parties, to be honest.
But many years ago. We are doing very well in our negotiation with China. We pretty much concluded our negotiation with Canada and with Mexico. We have done the deal and signed the deal with South Korea, which a lot of people said was not going to happen; would be impossible. It's a good deal. It was a horrible deal; it's a good deal.
I think a lot of this has to do with the fact, though, that already companies are moving back into our country -- that have left our country, in some cases. In some cases, they're moving back because they want to be here. But in many cases, these are automobile companies that have left and gone to other countries, and now they're coming back to the United States.
So it's nice to see. One of the things that's so beautiful to watch is 3.2 percent wage growth. That hasn’t happened in so long for our country. That's an incredible thing, and that means people are actually getting more money, taking home for money. And that's something that's really nice to see. A lot of you have been following me when we were on a thing called the campaign.
That was an exciting campaign. It was a great campaign. And I used to talk about wages going down, not going up -- but going down for years. Nineteen years. And now they just went up 3.2 percent, and yet there is no inflation because other things are going down, like the price of your gasoline at the tank.
It's low. And that doesn’t happen by luck. I work hard on that. That's like a tax cut for people. So a lot of good things are happening. Labor participation rate increased to 63.1. And that's an incredible number also. So I just wanted to bring that out. The economy is very good. And remember, from the time of my election, the stock market has gone up very close to 30 percent.
And that's with all of the things that are happening. And there are a lot of things happening. We have a massive trade negotiation going on with China. President Xi is very much involved; so am I. We're dealing at the highest levels and we're doing very well. We're -- we're doing very well. In the meantime, we've taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and from others.
Our steel industry has come roaring back, and that makes me very happy. I think we'll have to build a steel wall, as opposed to a concrete wall, because we have steel companies again. There's something awfully nice about that sound. So we had a productive meeting today with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer.
I thought it was, really, a very, very good meeting. We're all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open. We're going to be meeting -- I've designated a group, and we're going to be meeting over the weekend, that group, to determine what we're going to do about the border. Really, I want to thank a lot of the Border Patrol people and ICE people who came up yesterday.
They had a tremendous impact on, I think, a lot of Democrats, frankly, but a lot of people, because they were able to lay out exactly what the problem is. And one of the problems described to me -- as an example, you have ports of entry. We're going to agree with Chuck and Nancy and Steny, and Dick Durbin was there.
And we're going to agree that -- and we want to make the ports bigger, more powerful, able to handle more traffic; have very, very powerful drug equipment there. So they make very good stuff now. We don't have it because of budgets and other reasons. But we're going to make our ports of entry very powerful, very strong.
We're going to have the best drug-finding equipment anywhere in the world. They make it much better today than they made it even two years ago. And I explained to them -- the problem is, though, we can have a wonderful port of entry, but you have 2,000 miles of border between the United States and Mexico.
And if you take a look and you see, like we do, through certain technology -- including cameras and airplanes, not just drones -- you'll see vast numbers of vehicles driving through the desert and entering where you don’t have a very powerful fence or a wall. That happened this week, where a wonderful, young police officer -- I spoke to his wife yesterday -- where he was shot, viciously shot, for simply stopping a person that came over the border illegally.
Got shot. Killed. And took the most beautiful picture just hours before -- a Christmas picture. We don’t want that happening. But I was explained too, and I explained to people -- because it's really common sense: So you have ports of entry, and we have great security at the ports of entry, and then you may have fencing or walls, up and down, left and right, east and west.
But they stop because we don’t have proper border security. These people have vehicles and they drive to the right. They're not going through where we have great Border Patrol officers and ICE officers, and military now. I tell you, the military has done a fantastic job. They don’t stop. They go right to the easiest part and the weakest part, sometimes out in desert.
But you have miles and miles and miles of unprotected area. And you can see where they drive over. You even have people walking that track. And that's a very dangerous trek. And they bring children -- or even worse, they use children. You know, children are the biggest beneficiaries of what we want to do. Children are hurt more than anybody else.
These coyotes, what they do with children, all because we have open borders, because they think they can get away with it. They don’t come in through the port, where we have a lot of protection. They come in through empty areas, vast spaces -- empty areas -- just like this terrible person came in when he shot Officer Singh.
They come in through these vast, open areas. You don’t even have a sign saying ""Mexico/U.S."" There's no sign designating you have just entered the United States. It's just open space. And I explained that to the meeting today with Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and a lot of other people at the meeting. And I said, one of the things that happens there is human traffickers -- maybe that's the worst of all -- where you'll have traffickers having three and four women with tape on their mouths and tied up, sitting in the back of a van or a car, and they'll drive that van or the car not through a port of entry, where we have very talented people that look for every little morsel of drugs, or even people, or whatever they're looking for.
Not going to go there. They get off the road and they drive out into the desert, and they come on, they make a left turn. Usually it's a left, not a right. Most of them come out -- because in San Diego and in areas of California, we just finished brand-new walls. Beautiful walls. Steel walls. And they wanted them badly.
They were asking us. That's why we did it there. I said, ""Let's not do it in California."" California always complains through their great governors. They're always complaining. I said, ""Let's not do it. Let the governor ask us."" But we did it anyway because they really needed it. They were having tremendous problems.
So we built a brand-new wall in San Diego, and it's working really well. You should go and look at it. It's amazing. It's incredible how well it works. But these coyotes and these human traffickers, they make a right turn before they get to the port of entry. They go as far as the wall is, or as far as the barricade is, and then they make a left: ""Welcome to the United States."" And what they do with usually the women -- sometimes children -- that they're trafficking with, and in, you don’t want to know about.
So the only way you're going to stop that is by having a solid steel structure or concrete structure, whether it's a wall or some form of very powerful steel. Now, the steel is actually more expensive than the concrete, but I think we're probably talking about steel because I really feel the other side feels better about it. And I can understand what they're saying.
It is more expensive. We mentioned the price that we want -- $5.6 billion -- very strongly. Because numbers are thrown around -- 1.6, 2.1, 2.5. This is national security we're talking about. We're not talking about games. We're talking about national security. This should have been done by all of the Presidents that preceded me. And they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it. So we're not playing games.
We have to do it. And just remember, human traffickers. Remember drugs. The drugs are pouring into this country. They don’t go through the ports of entry. When they do, they sometimes get caught. When we finish -- and the Democrats do want this; they want ports of entry strengthened, and I want to do that too.
In fact, we have it down. It's about $400 million. And we can have the best equipment in the world. Now what they'll do -- if we have the protection and we have strong ports of entry, with this incredible drug-finding equipment, I don't know what they're going to do, because they're not coming in through -- past the steel gates or the steel walls, or the concrete walls, depending on what's happening.
Because we are meeting this weekend. We have a group. I've set up a group. They are going to tell us who their group of experts and probably people in the Senate. And congressmen and women are going to come. And we have three -- I said, give us three. Then I said, ""You know what, send over nine or six or three or two."" Doesn’t matter.
Send over whoever you want. But it's common sense. So now, when they make that turn, they make it. And now, all of a sudden, they can't go any further and they have to go back. And that's going to stop the caravans for two reasons. Number one, they're not going to be able to get through. But when they realize they can't get through, what's going to happen?
They're not going to form and they're not going to try and come up. And they can apply for asylum and they can -- most importantly, they can apply for citizenship because the companies that I told you, that created these great job numbers -- they're incredible job numbers, beyond anybody's expectations. I don’t think there was one Wall Street genius -- of which I know many of them, but they're not geniuses -- there's not one that predicted anywhere close to these job numbers.
I thought they were going to be good. But there wasn’t one that I saw. So now we have everything so beautifully handled. We need to have, however -- we need border security. And all of this security, if we do what I think what the Democrats want, all of the border things that we'll be building will be done right here in the good, old USA by steel companies that were practically out of business when I came into office as President.
And now they're thriving. You call up the heads of U.S. Steel, and I could name 10 companies. If you look at what's going on with the steel industry, it's almost a miracle. It was a dead industry. We need steel for defense. We need steel for a lot of things. Steel and aluminum. But those industries were in deep trouble.
The steel industry was almost dead, and now it's a very vibrant, vibrant industry. So what I'm going to do is ask, first of all, Mike Pence, Vice President, to say a couple of words, because Mike is -- we put together a team of people that will work over the weekend, and they'll be negotiating on the border, on the look, on different things having to do with border security, including at the ports of entry.
And I think they're going to be very successful because I found the Democrats really want to do something. So we're at 5.6. If you look at it -- $5.6 billion. But we are able to also, in addition to that -- because what we want to do has to be done properly, and we're negotiating very tough prices. Very, very tough.
Because you heard much higher numbers. Those higher numbers were very much a misnomer. You heard twenty and twenty-five billion in DACA. What happened is, when a judge incredibly -- because it was an incredibly, I will say, wrong decision. In fact, President Obama, when he signed the DACA with the executive order, made a statement to the effect, this isn’t going to work.
And some judge from the Ninth Circuit -- here we go again -- upheld it. And then it was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Appellate, and now it's going before the United States Supreme Court. And hopefully, that will be properly adjudicated. Because if it is, talks will begin on larger immigration matters having to do with DACA, having to do with other things.
So that is taking place. We may add a few things onto our discussions over the weekend. But I'm going to ask Mike Pence, and then I'll have Leader McCarthy say a few words, and we'll take a couple of questions. But we're very proud of jobs and the job numbers. That was incredible. And I think I'll be even more proud if we can have great border security for the first time in, really, the history of our country.
The southern border is a dangerous, horrible disaster. We've done a great job, but you can't really do the kind of job we have to do unless you have a major, powerful barrier. And that's what we're going to have to have. So, first, we start with Mike Pence.
Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Kevin?
Five times as many.
Thank you. Steve, please.
Thank you very much, Steve. Thank you. Major, go ahead. Sure.
I did.
I did.
I did say that. Absolutely, I said that. I don’t think it will, but I am prepared. And I think I can speak for Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate. They feel very strongly about having a safe country, having a border that makes sense. Without borders -- I've said it many times -- we don’t have a country.
I hope it doesn’t go on even beyond a few more days. It really could open very quickly. I told them that -- bring who you want. We have three people. You can ideally bring three, but you can bring six, you can bring nine, you can bring twelve. And they're going to be working over the weekend. I think it may have been somewhat contentious but I think it was very productive, I have to say that.
And I think he said that too.
Well, I don’t want to get into that because I don’t want to put them in a position where they have to justify anything to a lot of the people that they have to make happy. We want to save lives. We want children to be safe. The children are being decimated. And I'm not talking about necessarily children in our country.
I'm talking about wonderful children that are coming up from other places, whether it's Honduras or Guatemala, or El Salvador or Mexico, or other places. And we have to take care of those children also. We can't let them die on the way up. What's happening to women on those caravans, you're not talking about it, but it's horrible what's happening.
If they know it's not going to take place because they can't get through because we have a great border wall, or fence, or barrier, they're not going to come up and you're not going to have the problem. At the same time, they can apply to come into our country legally, like so many people have done. And we need people, Major.
We have to have people. Because we have all these companies coming in. We need great people. But we want them to come in on a merit basis, and they have to come in on a merit basis. They can't come in the way they've been coming in for years. I get calls from the great tech companies, and they're saying we don't allow people at the top of their class, at the best schools in the country, we don’t allow them to stay in our country.
So they end up going back to China and Japan and so many other countries all over the world, and we don’t keep them. They get educated at our finest schools, and then we don’t allow them, through a various set of circumstances, to have any guarantees of staying. So we lose out on great minds. We can't do that.
We have companies that, if we don’t change that -- and we're working on that, and we discussed that with the Democrats, and I think they agree. We're working on that. But we don’t want to lose our great companies because we have a ridiculous policy that we won't accept smart people. So, call it politically correct or not, but we have to let these great, brilliant companies have the smartest people in the world.
Yes, ma'am.
Hold it. One at a time, please. Go ahead.
Well, we think it can go very quickly. No, we won't be opening until it's solved. We think this is a much bigger problem. The border is a much more dangerous problem. It's a much bigger problem. It's a problem of national security. It's a problem of terrorists. You know, I talk about human traffickers. I talk about drugs.
I talk about gangs. But a lot of people don’t say -- we have terrorists coming through the southern border because they find that's probably the easiest place to come through. They drive right in and they make a left. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. So we're not going to do that. We won't be doing pieces.
We won't be doing it in dribs and drabs. And I'll tell you what: I've seen a lot of people over the last week and a half. I've been right in this magnificent structure right behind you. It's called the White House. And I was here on Christmas, and I was here. My family was in Florida. I said, go to Florida.
And I didn’t even find it to be a lonely place. There's something very special about the White House. But I was here at Christmas. I was here on New Year's Eve. And I will tell you, the people that I've spoken with -- and I've gotten to meet a lot of people that I wouldn’t have met. A lot of people have been coming through the White House and explaining different things and different attitudes.
A lot of people that you think are upset, and certainly they're not thrilled -- but they say, ""Sir, do the right thing. We need border security."" And these are people that won't be getting paid. Border Patrol, yesterday, was saying, ""Sir, we're affected by it. Do what's right. It's time."" This is after many, many decades.
Many, many decades. This should have taken place a long time ago. We're going to get it done. Yes, ma'am.
Yeah.
Well, sometimes that's what happens in a negotiation. It does take longer than it should. And sometimes you agree to things that could have been agreed to two weeks ago. But that's just the way a negotiation is. I mean, we set out a number -- $5.6 billion. We're very firm on a number. We also explained that, as you probably understand, the military is very affected.
We may use the military for parts of it. Homeland Security obviously is very affected. We may, in addition to the 5.6, we will use Homeland Security funds. So we have things happening, in addition to the 5.6, but we have to get a structure built. Please, go ahead. Go ahead.
Well, we discussed it a long time ago, as you remember. That was when they had this mythical number of $25 billion. But actually, it was $25 billion, but only $1 billion upfront. Then we talked $2 billion, $1.5 billion. The rest of it, the government couldn’t guarantee because it's not set up to guarantee.
You remember those discussions. But where it really ended was when the judge ruled against, and it was -- I said, as soon as that happened -- because that was a shocking decision. It was shocking to the Democrats, and it was more shocking to the Republicans. It was an incorrect decision. It was a political decision made by a judge.
And I know a lot of people don’t like when I say it, but try going there sometime, to the Ninth Circuit, and try winning a case. Not easy. Everyone files right in the Ninth Circuit. The fact is, it was a terrible decision and an incorrect decision. When that decision came down, when that judge ruled the way he ruled, I said, as soon as I heard it -- I said, you know what's going to happen?
We're never going to hear from them again. And that's exactly. That's what broke up the DACA deal. Yes, we had a pathway. We had many things. That was getting close to being a deal. The problem was that the money was a very small amount of money. It wasn’t really the 25; it was 25 and then come back every year.
Well, we don’t want to go through that every year. But we were getting close. And I said, as soon as that decision came down -- that incorrect and horrible decision. I mean, there’s been a number of them made lately. But as soon as that decision came down, I said, “You’ll never hear from them again.” And I called up, I said, “Hi, it’s President Trump.
What’s going on?” They say, “President Trump -- we don’t know who that is.” It was over. The deal was over. That’s what killed the DACA deal. It was nothing else. It was the judge’s decision. And if the Supreme Court does what, really, everyone thinks from a legal standpoint it should be doing; if they don’t allow the President of the United States, which is me, also -- because if President Obama is allowed to do that, I’m allowed to do it also.
Can you imagine? If the Supreme Court overrules that wrong executive order, we’ll have a deal very quickly on DACA and other things. And the Democrats want that, and so do we. But once he ruled that way, it was something you couldn’t really negotiate. Yes, Hallie.
Well, you know, I appreciate the way you say that. But once -- I’m very proud of doing what I'm doing. I don’t call it a shutdown. I call it ""doing what you have to do for the benefit and for the safety of our country."" But when Nancy Pelosi said, “You don’t have the votes in Congress,” I will tell you what I was proud of: I was never more proud of my Republican Party and those congressmen and women when they saw that, and they got together and they voted 217 to 185. And it wasn’t even close.
That was an incredible day -- I’m very proud of that -- when she said you couldn’t get the vote. And I’m not holding that against her -- because despite the fact that I’m not saying it was an easy meeting, or even a kind meeting, or a nice meeting, but in the end, I think we’ve come a long way. We’re going to be working very hard over the weekend, and we’ll see if we can do something.
So you can call it whatever you want. You can call it the Schumer or the Pelosi or the Trump shutdown. Doesn’t make any difference to me. It’s just words.
Go ahead.
Yeah, just one second. Just one second, please. Please. Go ahead.
Yeah.
Because we want to do what’s right, and we want to do it all at one time. We don’t want to take it in pieces. We just don’t want to do that. And DACA is going to be a great subject. I look forward to discussing it. We’ll discuss it at another time. But there are a lot of great things that can happen with DACA if the Democrats want to do that.
I think what we’re all waiting for, to be honest, is the Supreme Court judge -- judges -- the Supreme Court justices’ ruling in a not very long period of time. You know, as you know, it’s up now; hopefully, they will be making a ruling maybe sometime in the summer. So I think before we discuss too much DACA, I would like to see what happens.
I think it’s a very important decision. Because, frankly, if they rule the way it is, it gives the President too much power. Can you imagine me saying that? But I would be entitled to the same power. It’s not a correct thing that took place. And President Obama never felt it was going to hold up. And it held up. But I don’t think it’s going to hold up at the Supreme Court.
If it doesn’t hold up, you’re going to see a lot of good things happening because you’ll be having DACA and you’ll be putting other things with DACA. Hopefully, by that time, the wall will be well under construction. And just a little statement on that: We’ve already built a lot of the wall. We’ve been working very, very hard.
We’ve renovated a tremendous amount of wall. I just told you we did a lot of wall in San Diego, where we needed it very badly, where they wanted it very badly. So we haven’t been sitting still for the first, believe it or not, less than two years. We’ve been working very, very hard. The wall is -- we’ve done a lot of miles of wall already.
So we’re not just starting off fresh, but we have large numbers of miles that we have to do. And we can’t let gaps. Because if you have gaps, those people are going to turn their vehicles, or the gangs -- they’re going to coming in through those gaps. And we cannot let that happen. Kevin. Kevin. Kevin.
Well, you can’t impeach somebody that’s doing a great job. That’s the way I view it. I’ve probably done more in the first two years than any President, any administration, in the history of our country. If you look at tax cuts, you look at regulations, you look at what we’ve done for the vets, you look at the rebuilding of the military and the numbers that we’re talking about, and many other things -- I could give you a list that’s pages long.
So I think it’s very hard to impeach somebody who’s done a great job. That’s number one. And we even talked about that today. I said, “Why don’t you use this for impeachment?” And Nancy said, “We’re not looking to impeach you.” I said, “That’s good, Nancy. That’s good.” But you know what? You don’t impeach people when they’re doing a good job.
And you don’t impeach people when there was no collusion. Because there was no collusion. You know Russians better than I do, Kevin. Okay? There was no collusion. I didn’t need Russians to help me win Iowa. I didn’t need Russians to help me win the great state of Wisconsin and Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
I won them because I went there and I campaigned hard. And my opponent didn’t go there enough, and she lost a lot of good states. A lot of states that for many, many years, for decades, have gone Democrat. They went Republican. That’s why I won. Not because of -- not because of Russia.
Well, I thought her comments were disgraceful. This is a person that I don’t know. I assume she’s new. I think she dishonored herself, and I think she dishonored her family. Using language like that in front of her son, and whoever else was there, I thought that was a great dishonor to her and to her family.
I thought it was it was highly disrespectful to the United States of America. Yes. Go ahead.
That’s right.
Well, you’re going to be seeing it very soon. We made a new deal -- a new trade deal. NAFTA has been one of the great disasters of all time. Probably the worst trade deal ever made, maybe. We lost millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies. NAFTA left our country dry. NAFTA was a disaster. I campaigned on either terminating or renegotiating NAFTA.
And Bob Lighthizer and Jared Kushner, and a whole group of people, did an incredible job. They did an incredible job. And now we have a deal that’s great for our country and, by the way, good for Mexico, good for Canada, also. As you know, it’s the three countries. We will be taking in billions and billions of dollars more money for the United States, including jobs, including companies that won’t be leaving us anymore and going to Mexico, and in some cases, Canada, to a lesser extent.
But we lost 25 percent of our car business because of NAFTA. NAFTA was a disaster. Now we have the USMCA. It’s the United States, Mexico, and Canada Trade Agreement. It’s brand new. It’s totally different. It makes it very difficult for companies to, incentive wise, move to other countries. And we will be making billions and billions of dollars a year more money.
And that is paying --
Excuse me. Because I didn’t have to. That is paying for the wall many, many times over. In fact, what we save on the USMCA -- the new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada -- what we save on that, just with Mexico, will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year, two years, and three years.
So I view that as, absolutely, Mexico is paying for the wall. And that’s fine. Yes. Yes, ma’am. Go.
Oh, here we go again.
A very nice question so beautifully asked, even though I just answered it.
Look, let me just tell you --
Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you ready? Are you ready? I just told you that we just made a trade deal and we will take in billions and billions of dollars, far more than the cost of the wall. The wall is peanuts compared to what the value of this trade deal is to the United States. As far as concrete, I said I was going to build a wall.
I never said, “I’m going to build a concrete…” I said I’m going to build a wall.
Just so you -- because I know you’re not into the construction business. You don’t understand something: We now have a great steel business that’s rebuilt in the United States. Steel is stronger than concrete. If I build this wall, or fence, or anything the Democrats need to call it -- because I’m not into names, I’m into production.
I’m into something that works. If I build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall, it will actually be stronger than a concrete. Steel is stronger than concrete. Okay? In case you -- you can check it out. Listen, if I build a wall, and the wall is made out of steel instead of concrete, I think people will like that.
And here’s the other good thing: I’ll have it done by the United States Steel Corporation, by companies in our country that are now powerful, great companies again. And they’ve become powerful over the last two years because of me and because of our trade policies. So if I have a steel wall -- or you could call it a steel fence -- but it’ll be more powerful than any of the concrete walls that we’re talking about.
It’s possible that it will look better. And one of the things -- I think you have seen this -- that’s very important for us -- very, very important -- in speaking to Border Patrol, ICE and, actually, local law enforcement, and even military: They want to be able to see through it. You can’t really see through a concrete wall.
They want to be able to see who's on the other side of the wall. Because if they’re here, and you have about a 12-inch concrete wall, and you have people on the other side but you can’t see what’s over there, it’s very dangerous. They want to be able to see through the wall. A see-through wall made out of steel is far stronger than a concrete wall.
So I’m very happy with it. I think -- I think -- I’m not sure, but I think that’s what the Democrats prefer. And if it can get them there, I’m okay. It actually will be a more powerful wall, and it will be a more beautiful wall than having a concrete wall. Jeff. Jeff, go ahead.
Go ahead. Go ahead, Jeff.
Well, I think we’re doing very well. China is paying us tremendous tariffs. We’re getting billions and billions of dollars of money pouring into the Treasury of the United States -- which, in history, we’ve never gotten from China. As you know, it’s been very unfair. I had a fantastic meeting with President Xi, who I both like and respect.
One of the things that came out of that meeting was fentanyl. As you know, almost all of it comes from China. And he’s going to now criminalize the making of fentanyl. And unlike our country, they have unbelievably strong prohibitions about drugs. That was not on their list. They view it as a -- I guess, as some kind of a commercial product.
Now they view it as something that’s very dangerous. They’re going to be changing their laws to make -- to make fentanyl a criminal -- a criminal process, if you’re making fentanyl. If they do that, you know what their ultimate is; it’s called the death penalty. I think that could have a tremendous -- and I thanked President Xi very much.
It was the first question I said to him before we started the trade talks in Argentina. This was a meeting that was supposed to last for about 45 minutes, and it ended up being almost four hours. Some of you were there. It was a great meeting. We’ll see what happens. You never know with a deal. But I will tell you, China is not doing well now, and it puts us in a very strong position.
We are doing very well. But we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars, and I hope we’re going to make a deal with China. And if we don’t, they’re paying us tens of billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs. It’s not the worst thing in the world. But I think we will -- I think we will make a deal with China.
I really think they want to. I think they sort of have to. And I think we’re going to have a great relationship. I think that President Xi and myself have a great relationship. Also, North Korea. We’re doing very well with North Korea, and that’s based on relationship also. Yeah.
All right. Go ahead. One more quick one. Go ahead, Jeff.
No, I’m not. I mean, look, they’ve gone up a lot. You know, they’ve gone up hundreds of percent since I’m President. Apple was at a number that was incredible. And they’re going to be fine. Apple is a great company, but that’s not my -- look, I have to worry about our country. Don’t forget -- don’t forget this: Apple makes their product in China.
I told Tim Cook, who’s a friend of mine, who I like a lot: “Make your product in the United States. Build those big, beautiful plants that go on for miles, it seems. Build those plants in the United States.” I like that even better. Apple makes its product in China. China is the biggest beneficiary of Apple, more than us, because they build their product mostly in China.
But now he’s investing $350 billion because of what we did with taxes and the incentives that we created. In the United States, he’s going to build a campus, and lots of other places. So my focus is the United States. I want to get those companies to come back -- like so many are doing -- into the United States.
I want Apple to make their iPhones, and all of the great things that they make, in the United States. And that’ll take place. Please. Go ahead.
Well, the safety net is going to be having a strong border because we’re going to be safe. I’m not talking about economically, but ultimately economically. I really believe that these people -- many of the people that we’re talking about, many of the people you’re discussing -- I really believe that they agree with what we’re doing.
And we can have this -- April, we can have this fixed very quickly. We can -- this can happen by early next week. We’re going to be working over the weekend. We could have a solution to this, but I wanted to keep it all at one point. And I think a lot of people that you’re referring to, April, are really wanting that to happen, too.
I really believe a lot of them want to see border security. And they’re willing to give it up. I had -- when I had the people in yesterday -- and they represent most of the Border Patrol. The people that you had yesterday, that were at the news conference, they represent most of Border Patrol. Every one of them said, “Don’t even think about us. Get this fixed.
That is doing the great thing for our country.” As far as eminent domain, you’re right, a hundred percent. Eminent domain is very interesting. But without eminent domain, you wouldn’t have any highways, you wouldn’t have any schools, you wouldn’t have any roadways. What we’re doing with eminent domain is, in many cases, we’ll make a deal upfront.
And we’ve already done that. The Secretary has done a lot of that. And if we can’t make a deal, we take the land, and we pay them through a court process -- which goes, actually, fairly quickly. And we’re generous. But we take the land. Otherwise, you could never build anything. If you didn’t use eminent domain, you wouldn’t have one highway in this country.
You have to use eminent domain. It’s actually something you don’t want to use it, but if you’re going to do a stretch -- as an example, pipelines and other things that go -- you have to use eminent domain; otherwise, you’d never be able to buy the land. If we had one person that wouldn’t sell us -- out of hundreds, just one; it only takes one -- then we wouldn’t be able to build proper border security because we’d have that big opening that I was talking about.
So what happens is some are paid upfront. You make a deal upfront. And we're willing to do that in all cases. And when they're unwilling to make a deal, which also happens, then you go to court. But in the meantime, we're able to build the border security. So I think it's a fair process. I think it's a process that's very necessary.
But I think it's fair.
No, it's not going to hold it up, because under the military version of eminent domain, and under, actually, Homeland Security, we can do it before we even start. Now, a lot of times we'll make a deal, and I would say a good percentage of the time we're making deals. We have already purchased a lot of it. You know, a lot of the money that we've been given has already been spent on purchasing the land, the right of way.
It's essentially a right of way. So we are very, very far along on that. But eminent domain is something that has to be used. Usually you would say for anything that's long, like a road, like a pipeline, or like a wall or a fence. Okay? Thank you. Good question. It's a good question. Please. Please, go ahead.
Should we keep this going or not, folks?
I just don’t want to say, ""Oh, he stood out there."" You know, you have so many questions. I'm just looking at Mike and Steve and Kevin. I'm saying, should we -- and most importantly, Madam Secretary.
I'm just -- oh, are you cold? Get out of here. You want mine? No, I'm just saying, should we keep this going a little bit longer?
Go ahead.
Let me know when you get tired.
Yes, I have.
Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want.
No, we can use them -- absolutely, we can call a national emergency because of the security of our country. Absolutely. No, we can do it. I haven’t done it. I may do it. I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it's another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving that a shot.
I never threaten anybody. But I am allowed to do that, yes.
Called a national emergency.
No, they're going to pay tremendous tax.
I'll give you an example. When a company was going to leave for Mexico -- or Canada -- but for Mexico, because we lost tremendous amounts of our car business, like 25 percent, to Mexico. If they stay, all of those taxes that they have been paying -- real estate taxes, sales taxes, employee/employer taxes, tremendous taxes that nobody even understands they pay.
They're tremendous. Income taxes -- federal income taxes. State income taxes, in some cases. All of those taxes stay with us. The wall is -- you know, it's great. But the USMCA, which gives a disincentive for companies to leave -- it's a tremendous disincentive. Anybody that leaves after this deal is done -- look, it's one of the primary reasons that I like it. Because I can live pre-NAFTA too.
The only thing I can't live with is NAFTA. I could live pre-NAFTA, before NAFTA -- before everybody left New England and left all of the different places -- Ohio, Pennsylvania. I mean, you still have empty steel factories all over the place, and other factories. I can live pre-NAFTA, very easily. But the only thing I'm not living with is NAFTA.
That was one of the worst trade deals ever made.
Well, many, many times over. Look, the USMCA will make, in the form that we right now are losing approximately a hundred -- hard to believe. And this doesn’t include the drugs pouring in, which is probably a much higher number than anybody would even know, in addition to destroying lives and families so horribly.
We are losing close to $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico, for many years. Not only that -- they have a tax of 17 percent. We don’t have a tax. So they have a value-added tax of 17 percent. We don’t have a tax of 17 percent. That deal was bad the day it was made. Because they charged the tax before the deal was made, and we didn’t. It was an obsolete deal when it was made, like 30 years ago, whenever it was.
No, no, all of this stuff is changing now. This is a fair deal. This is a good deal for Mexico. Frankly, oil companies and other companies have an incentive now to go to Mexico and take oil out. And that's why we're keeping gasoline prices so low. You look at what's going on with gasoline prices. I mean, it's rather incredible.
If you look back four months ago, oil hit $83 a barrel. Eighty-three. It was heading to 100, and then it could have gone to 125. You want to see problems? Let that happen. After I made some phone calls to OPEC and the OPEC nations -- which is essentially a monopoly -- all of a sudden, it started coming down.
I'm very happy with what's happened, and I'm very happy that people are paying a lot less, in many cases, than two dollars a gallon for gasoline. You look at what's happening -- everyone is talking about -- didn’t happen by luck; it happened through talent.
Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Look, I don’t think it will. I'm prepared --
Right.
Well, we'll have to talk to the Cabinet members then, okay? I'm sure they don’t even know that. Let me just say --
Let me just tell you this: It's very important that we have great border security. I think it's going to be over with sooner than people think. But I will do whatever we have to do. If we have to stay out for a very long period of time, we're going to do that. And many of those people -- maybe even most of those people -- that really have not been, and will not be getting their money in at this moment -- those people, in many cases, are the biggest fan of what we're doing.
All right. Please. Major, go ahead.
Well, I might consider that. You know, that's something I may consider. That's a very good question. Okay, who else is out there? Mike, who do you see out there that's always been very fair to us? Go ahead. Yeah, good. Go ahead. Go ahead.
No -- that's right. Right?
Mike likes you.
Mike highly recommended you. Watch, this will be the killer of them all. Go ahead.
I think they will. I think they will.
No, I think that happens. You know -- hey, I've been a landlord for a long time. I've been in the real estate business for a long time. When you see there are problems out there, difficulties out there -- you know, the people are all good for the money -- they work with people. They work with people.
I would, sure. I would encourage them to be nice and easy. We have a bigger subject that we're doing. It's called ""the security of our nation,"" including terrorism, please. Okay.
Go ahead. Please, go ahead.
Go ahead. No, no, come on.
Thank you.
Oh, he's been great. He's been really fantastic. Mitch McConnell -- first of all, he was here. He was with us for hours at the meeting.
Because he's running the Senate. I mean, Mitch McConnell has been fantastic. He has been really great. He's right at the top of everything that we're doing, and he's really been fantastic. Kirstjen, do you want to answer that question about the terrorists, please?
So I think that we can say with surety, I think it was a great meeting. We'll see what happens. It may get solved. It may not get solved. You now know the number. You now know what we're willing to do. And if we have to do it, we'll do it. And again, we're going to be, I believe, very productive over the weekend.
We have a very talented group. They have a very talented group of people, so I understand. And I think some tremendous things will happen. And I really believe the biggest beneficiaries of what we're doing are children, are women, are workers. And a lot of these people that really do benefit are not only the people in our country, but the people that travel up trying to get into a country that they think they're going to get into and they can't. And they get sick, and there's tremendous damage done to them and their families.
These are all tremendous beneficiaries of what we're doing. So this really does have a higher purpose than next week's pay. And the people that won't get next week's pay, or the following week's pay, I think if you ever really looked at those people, I think they'd say, ""Mr. President, keep going. This is far more important."" I want to thank you all.
And we'll see you soon. They'll be working very hard over the weekend. Thank you very much. Thank you.
