Craig Williams,United Kingdom,2020-06-08,"I have to confess to the House, or to what is left of the House, that I secured this debate in what feels like a very different world. Although the restoration of the canal is, of course, hugely important, the covid-19 crisis has slightly changed the tone in which I will speak on it. I see the Minister is in her place. I very much look forward to hearing her thoughts on how we can restore the rest of the UK’s canal network.
This afternoon, I joined my constituents and interested parties over Zoom to talk about the Montgomery canal—it is very important that it is the Montgomery, not Montgomeryshire, canal, as I keep getting reminded—with Michael Haig from the Inland Waterways Association and Michael Limbrey, who heads the Montgomery restoration efforts. I can report to the House and the Minister that the efforts to restore Montgomery canal are alive and well, and going at great speed thanks to a recent national lottery heritage fund grant of up to £4 million, which is being spent as we speak, and thanks to the volunteers.
I know that my hon. My hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield is the chair of the all-party parliamentary waterways group, and he particularly wants to refocus this effort as the House gets back fully. I warn the Minister that I see today’s debate as a prelude on this subject, as I am sure that there will be debates coming thick and fast.
Before I go on to the wider benefits to the canal network, I will touch directly on the Montgomery canal, and give a bit of its history. The Montgomery canal was built through an Act of Parliament in 1794, and by 1796 a lot of it was in operation, running from Llangollen to Newtown. Sadly, in 1944, after a breach, it was rendered inoperable. Luckily, most of the land around the canal was kept intact, and now the Canal and River Trust owns most of it, which has helped with the restoration.
The Prince of Wales gave tremendous support and enthusiasm at the start, through the Prince of Wales Committee and the Variety Club of Great Britain, and in 1969, through the hard work of 180 volunteers and nine gallons of beer, the efforts started in earnest to restore the canal. The restoration of Montgomery canal would be a huge benefit to my constituency, especially as we look to support the tourism sector as we come out of covid-19. Although the effort is there, it would benefit massively from the Minister’s personal attention. I hope very much to walk down a stretch of the canal as we return to normal in our political operations, and I know the trust would welcome that too.
Canals are incredibly important to tourism, benefiting our sector to the tune of £1 billion in England, supporting 30,000 jobs. Through this crisis, a lot of businesses are of course suffering, as well as a lot of charities. I welcome the Government’s support to date, and I welcome the work of the Canal and River Trust. I pay particular tribute to the work of its chief executive, Richard Parry, ​who is donating an element of his salary to the charitable appeal that it is organising to support the Canal and River Trust and businesses affected at this time. A support package is really needed, and I know my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield has written not to the Minister in her place but to Treasury Ministers about that. I support the majority of the calls that have been made.
To return to the tourism impact, it is terrific to see developments happening right now down the canal, I think in anticipation of its eventual restoration. Montgomeryshire and rural parts of Wales suffer from a lack of scaled accommodation to host anything, but recent developments, such as new hotel provision, mean we can build at pace for the inevitable arrival of tourists after covid-19—not now. They are always welcome in Montgomeryshire, but at the moment we are closed for business. I ask them in due course to come and enjoy the canal network.
The canal touches lives, as we have seen throughout this crisis. Our towpaths and canal network give support to local residents, as I am sure they will in due course give support to constituents from across the UK. There are mental health benefits just from being able to walk those 35 miles. Huge provision is being made to increase the cycle network in this country, and the towpaths already cater for walkers, canal enthusiasts and cyclists. I hope that will generate more money into the sector. This is about providing a safe opportunity for people to enjoy the countryside and our canal networks, and I hope very much that the Minister and the Government will put more money into that.
Let us consider the environmental benefits alone. We have seen the creation of the special wildlife areas around the canal, as the volunteers and the trust have restored our canal locally in Montgomeryshire. Restorations across the UK have put in place two new reservoirs that would not otherwise exist at the moment. I could argue until the cows come home as to whether there is a huge negative effect of the restoration, but the mitigation goes above and beyond, and I pay tribute to those involved for that. I particularly wish to draw a response from the Minister on the environmental benefits both of the mitigations put in place and of the canal network of the UK.
Obviously, the restoration makes an economic contribution in terms of tourism, but the environmental benefits cannot be overstated. There are many projects along the Montgomery canal, and of particular fascination is the fact that there are 127 significant buildings, from the bridges to the warehouses of the canal age, that we seek to protect. The restoration is proving to be a way to build on that together. The Inland Waterways Association has helped to restore more than 500 miles of canals and rivers, and although there is much more to do, that local heritage on the Montgomery canal would be struggling without that work now. I am talking about many projects, such as the Schoolhouse bridge project, where we have recently been raising £300,000; we have secured local buy-in, but with Government support we could really deliver on a lot of these projects.
I have mentioned tourism and the environment, and I will start to draw my remarks to a close. I implore the Minister to consider that there are restoration projects in constituencies across the UK, and if we look at the ​gross value added effect of restoring canals, we see that there is a huge positive return to the Exchequer and the public purse. It is excellent value for money to invest in restoring our canal networks. I have alluded to the mental health benefits and the tourism effects, but if we work with the IWA and the Canal and River Trust, we can set out an excellent stall. The Government could invest in cycleways across the UK, not just in the cities and market towns, and could level up the canal network. People sometimes think that restoring the canals and turning the UK economy round on the basis of canals is a joke. I am not saying that it will completely restore the effects of the current crisis, but it will help. It will help draw together local businesses to build a plan for tourism and development. It will help drive domestic tourism, and it will have environmental benefits. I will leave that thought as a preamble to further debates on this subject, but I look forward to the Minister’s response.
",2020 Speech on the Restoration of Canals,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/craig-williams-2020-speech-on-the-restoration-of-canals/
Bill Clinton,United States of America,1999-01-19 00:00:00,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: Tonight, I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union.
Let me begin by saluting the new Speaker of the House, and thanking him, especially tonight, for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the gallery with Mrs. Hastert: Lyn Gibson and Wenling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.
Mr. Speaker, at your swearing-in, you asked us all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that.
For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year. And now we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.
Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century. America is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to the Middle East.
Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a government for the information age. Once again, a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our oldest values of opportunity, responsibility, and community; devoted to fiscal responsibility; determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century; a 21st century government for 21st century America.
My fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that the state of our Union is strong.
Now, America is working again. The promise of our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today. So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century.
Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge, the aging of America. With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a senior boom. So first, and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century.
Early in this century, being old meant being poor. When President Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called ""the stark terror of penniless, helpless old age."" Even today, without Social Security, half our nation's elderly would be forced into poverty.
Today, Social Security is strong. But by 2013, payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments. By 2032, the Trust Fund will be exhausted and Social Security will be unable to pay the full benefits older Americans have been promised.
The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits, not to raise payroll tax rates, not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it. Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security.
Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the private sector, just as any private or state government pension would do. This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55 years.
But we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years. We should reduce poverty among elderly women, who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other seniors. And we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.
Now, these changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both Houses, in both parties, and ask that we join together in saying to the American people: We will save Social Security now.
Now, last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved. First things first.
But again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare Commission. If we work together, we can secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of seniors, affordable prescription drugs.
Third, we must help all Americans, from their first day on the job to save, to invest, to create wealth. From its beginning, Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions and savings. Yet, today, millions of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer than ever simply must save more than ever.
Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century. I propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal savings accounts -- USA accounts -- to give all Americans the means to save. With these new accounts Americans can invest as they choose and receive funds to match a portion of their savings, with extra help for those least able to save. USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our nation's wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to support them.
Fourth, we must invest in long-term care. I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled, and the families who care for them. Long-term care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of America, and we must do more to help our families deal with it.
I was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren. Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should take it.
So with these four measures -- saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting long-term care -- we can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors.
Now, there are more children from more diverse backgrounds in our public schools than at any time in our history. Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire Nation to thrive in the new economy.
Today we can say something we couldn't say six years ago: With tax credits and more affordable student loans, with more work-study grants and more Pell Grants, with education IRAs and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut that more than five million Americans will receive this year, we have finally opened the doors of college to all Americans.
With our support, nearly every state has set higher academic standards for public schools, and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students. With over $1 billion in discounts available this year, we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet.
Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the job.
You know, our children are doing better. SAT scores are up; math scores have risen in nearly all grades. But there's a problem. While our 4th graders outperform their peers in other countries in math and science, our 8th graders are around average, and our 12th graders rank near the bottom. We must do better. Now, each year the national government invests more than $15 billion in our public schools. I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work.
First, later this year, I will send to Congress a plan that, for the first time, holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. My ""Education Accountability Act"" will require every school district receiving federal help to take the following five steps.
First, all schools must end social promotion. No child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material. But we can't just hold students back because the system fails them. So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and after-school programs, to keep a million children learning.
Now, if you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics. Math and reading scores are up three years running with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods. It will work, and we should do it.
Second, all states and school districts must turn around their worst-performing schools or shut them down. That's the policy established in North Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt. North Carolina made the biggest gains in test scores in the nation last year. Our budget includes $200 million to help states turn around their own failing schools.
Third, all states and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers. The great majority of our teachers do a fine job. But in too many schools, teachers don't have college majors -- or even minors -- in the subjects they teach. New teachers should be required to pass performance exams, and all teachers should know the subjects they're teaching. This year's balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher standards.
And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments, I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner cities and isolated rural areas and in Indian communities. Let us bring excellence in every part of America.
Fourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices. In too many communities, it's easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools. Every school district should issue report cards on every school. And parents should be given more choices in selecting their public school.
Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we should say that all states and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policies.
Now, let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many schools are so old they're falling apart, or so overcrowded students are learning in trailers. Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that. This year, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5,000 schools.
If we do these things -- end social promotion; turn around failing schools; build modern ones; support qualified teachers; promote innovation, competition and discipline -- then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st century schools.
Now, we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work. The most basic tool of all is a decent income. So let's raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years. And let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws.
That was encouraging, you know.  There was more balance on the seesaw. I like that. Let's give them a hand. That's great. 
Working parents also need quality child care. So again this year, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families, for improved safety and quality, for expanded after-school programs. And our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay-at-home parents, too. They need support, as well.
Parents should never have to worry about choosing between their children and their work. Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the very first bill I signed into law, has now, since 1993, helped millions and millions of Americans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs. I think it's time, with all the evidence that it has been so little burdensome to employers, to extend family leave to 10 million more Americans working for smaller companies. And I hope you will support it.
Finally on the matter of work, parents should never have to face discrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children. That is not right.
America's families deserve the world's best medical care. Thanks to bipartisan federal support for medical research, we are now on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's, to arthritis to cancer. But as we continue our advances in medical science, we can't let our medical system lag behind. Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America, driving down costs but threatening to drive down quality as well.
I think we ought to say to every American: You should have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. If you need a specialist, you should have a right to see one. You have a right to the nearest emergency care if you're in an accident. These are things that we ought to say. And I think we ought to say: You should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment, whether it's a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment, or anything else. I believe this.
Now, I've ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health programs. But only Congress can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans. Now, last year, Congress missed that opportunity, and we must not miss that opportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to join together across party lines and pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.
As more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to all our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we can all say to the American people, ""We will protect the privacy of medical records, and we will do it this year.""
Now two years ago, the Congress extended health coverage to up to five million children. Now we should go beyond that. We should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance. We should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare. And we should continue to ensure access to family planning.
No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And therefore, I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation, proposed by Senators Kennedy and Jeffords, Roth, and Moynihan to allow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work.
We need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our university health centers to provide basic, affordable care for all the millions of working families who don't have any insurance. They do a lot of that today, but much more can be done. And my balanced budget makes a good down payment toward that goal. I hope you will think about them and support that provision.
Let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness. No American should ever be afraid -- ever -- to address this disease. This year, we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health. With sensitivity, commitment, and passion, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here, and I'd like to thank her for what she's done. Thank you.  Thank you.
As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes. Now, I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to protect our children from tobacco, and to hold tobacco companies accountable while protecting tobacco farmers.
Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare and other programs. You know, the states have been right about this: Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema, and other smoking-related illnesses; the tobacco companies should. So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and, with the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare.
Now, if we act in these areas -- minimum wage, family leave, child care, health care, the safety of our children -- then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for the 21st century.
Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating economy in history. But we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that embraces all Americans.
Today's income gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, the Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need. And I applaud all of you here who were part of that. This year, I recommend a five-year commitment to the new system so that we can provide, over the next five years, appropriate training opportunities for all Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when businesses close. I hope you will support this.
Also, I ask your support for a dramatic increase in federal support for adult literacy, to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a fifth grade level. We need to do this.
Here's some good news: In the past six years, we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half. You can all be proud of that. Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people. And our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it.
We must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American communities, with more support for community development banks, for empowerment zones, for 100,000 more vouchers for affordable housing. And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up to $15 billion in private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunities to our inner cities and rural areas with tax credits, loan guarantees, including the new ""American Private Investment Company,"" modeled on the Overseas Private Investment Company.
For years and years and years, we've had this OPIC, this Overseas Private Investment Corporation, because we knew we had untapped markets overseas. But our greatest untapped markets are not overseas; they are right here at home. And we should go after them.
We must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm. As this Congress knows very well, dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farms. Last year, the Congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture. And I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance. I ask you to join with me and do this. This should not be a political issue. Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in rural America today, and we need an appropriate means to address it.
We must strengthen our lead in technology. It was government investment that led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28-percent increase in long-term computing research. We also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment, by solving the so-called Y2K computer problem.
We had one member of Congress stand up and applaud.  And we may have about that ratio out there applauding at home, in front of their television sets. But remember, this is a big, big problem. And we've been working hard on it. Already, we've made sure that the Social Security checks will come on time. But I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every state and local government, every business, large and small, to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.
For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad. You know, until recently, a third of our economic growth came from exports. But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk. Today, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard. This is the most serious financial crisis in half a century. To meet it, the United States and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund. And while the turmoil is not over, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it.
At the same time, we have to continue to work on the long-term project, building a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so much of Asia. This June I will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose, and I ask all of you to support our endeavors.
I also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century America. I'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this chamber in both parties. I think trade has divided us, and divided Americans outside this chamber, for too long. Somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and workers and environmentalists and farmers and government can stand together. I believe these are the things we ought to all agree on. So let me try.
First, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets, and expand trade. But at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries actually benefit from trade, a trade that promotes the dignity of work and the rights of workers and protects the environment. We must insist that international trade organizations be more open to public scrutiny, instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism.
When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is becoming more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century doing here at home. We have got to put a human face on the global economy.
We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our nation. I have already informed the government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America will respond.
We must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly $2 billion. I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade, based on these principles. And I ask the Congress again to join me in this common approach and to give the President the trade authority long used and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.
Tonight I issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United States in a new round of global trade negotiations to expand exports of services, manufactures, and farm products. Tonight I say we will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world. And this year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world.
If we do these things -- invest in our people, our communities, our technology, and lead in the global economy -- then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America.
You know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful, more secure, more free. All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in Northern Ireland. All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace. And with our NATO allies, we are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice, and to give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve.
All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel. Now I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement the Wye agreement to protect Israel's security, to stimulate the Palestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan. We must not -- we dare not -- let them down. I hope you will help.
As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations and terrorism. We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of terror. The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world. So let's give them the support they need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources they must have so America can continue to lead.
We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks. We must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergenices, to support research into vaccines and treatments.
We must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from Korea to India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands. Our balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost two-thirds over the next five years.
With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals. The START II treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their cold war height.
It's been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the treaty now, to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms, and to make sure we can end nuclear testing forever.
For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them. America will continue to contain Saddam, and we will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people.
Now, last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb. Their mission was so flawlessly executed that we risk taking for granted the bravery and the skill it required. Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10-year veteran of the Air Force, flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine. He's here with us tonight. I'd like to ask you to honor him and all the 33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox.
Captain Taliaferro. 
It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985. Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our military readiness. My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next six years for readiness, for modernization, and for pay and benefits for our troops and their families.
We are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every community in America by millions of our veterans. America's defenders today still stand ready at a moment's notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can. They always come through for America. We must come through for them.
The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security. The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U. N. I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts.
We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia, expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China.
In China, last year, I said to the leaders and the people what I'd like to say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty. But I'd also like to say again to the American people: It's important not to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China.
Last spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw democracy and reform rising but still held back by violence and disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching Radio Democracy for Africa, supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the ""African Trade and Development Act.""
We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean, our common work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy and increase trade. In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely chosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the blessings of liberty.
The American people have opened their hearts and their arms to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated by the recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, I am committed to help them rebuild. When the First Lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands of our troops and thousands of American volunteers. In the Dominican Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominicans and Americans, working side-by-side. With her was someone else who has been very important to the relief efforts.
You know, sports records are made and, sooner or later, they're broken. But making other people's lives better, and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood -- that lasts forever. So, for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in two countries tonight.  Thank you.
So I say to all of you, if we do these things -- if we pursue peace, fight terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances -- we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world.
As the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must make them safer, more livable, and more united. This year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget. The Brady bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns. And now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years.
Tonight I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer. Our balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in the areas hardest hit by crime and then to equip them with new tools, from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots.
We must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime. Our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment, saying to prisoners: If you stay on drugs, you have to stay behind bars; and to those on parole: If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free of drugs.
I ask Congress to restore the five-day waiting period for buying a handgun and extend the Brady bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun.
We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities. Last year, every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We were deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the hands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents don't have to live through their loss.
After she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, came here to the White House with a powerful plea. She said, ""Please, please, for the sake of your children, lock up your guns. Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town."" It's a message she is passionately advocating every day. Suzann is here with us tonight, with the First Lady. I'd like to thank her for her courage and her commitment.  Thank you.
In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act, to pass legislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to keep our children safe.
A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt defined our ""great, central task"" as ""leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us."" Today, we're restoring the Florida Everglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red rock canyons of Utah, protecting California's redwoods and our precious coasts. But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming; 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat waves, floods, and storms are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we do not act now.
Tonight I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce greenhouse and other pollution, and tax incentives and investments to spur clean energy technology. And I want to work with members of Congress in both parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases.
All our communities face a preservation challenge, as they grow and green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day. In response, I propose two major initiatives: First, a $1 billion livability agenda to help communities save open space, ease traffic congestion, and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life; and second, a $1 billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of natural beauty all across America from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park.
These are truly landmark initiatives, which could not have been developed without the visionary leadership of the Vice President, and I want to thank him very much for his commitment here.
Now, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something back. That's why we created AmeriCorps, our national service program that gives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college.
So far, in just four years, 100,000 young Americans have built low-income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped to tutor children with churches, worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters, and performed countless other acts of service that have made America better. I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in AmeriCorps.
Since 1997, our initiative on race has sought to bridge the divides between and among our people. In its report last fall, the initiative's advisory board found that Americans really do want to bring our people together across racial lines.
We know it's been a long journey. For some, it goes back to before the beginning of our Republic; for others, back since the Civil War; for others, throughout the 20th century. But for most of us alive today, in a very real sense, this journey began 43 years ago, when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up. She's sitting down with the First Lady tonight, and she may get up or not, as she chooses. We thank her.  Thank you, Rosa.
We know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as the Presidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps. The initiative I've outlined tonight will help to close them. But we know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either. Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong, and it ought to be illegal. Therefore, I ask Congress to make the ""Employment Non-Discrimination Act"" and the ""Hate Crimes Prevention Act"" the law of the land.
Now, since every person in America counts, every American ought to be counted. We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do that.
Our new immigrants must be part of our One America. After all, they're revitalizing our cities; they're energizing our culture; they're building up our economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life. That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of government. There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that. Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet their responsibility. I hope you will support it.
Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America.
You know, barely more than 300 days from now, we will cross that bridge into the new millennium. This is a moment, as the First Lady has said, ""to honor the past and imagine the future.""
I'd like to take just a minute to honor her. For leading our Millennium Project, for all she's done for our children, for all she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best ideals at home and abroad, I honor her. 
Last year, I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary has traveled all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas Edison's invention factory or Harriet Tubman's home. Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community. And tonight, before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community to become a nationally recognized ""millennium community,"" by launching projects that save our history, promote our arts and humanities, prepare our children for the 21st century.
Already, the response has been remarkable. And I want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to members in Congress of both parties for their support. Just one example: Because of you, the Star-Spangled Banner will be preserved for the ages. In ways large and small, as we look to the millennium we are keeping alive what George Washington called ""the sacred fire of liberty.""
Six years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us. But across this country, in a thousand neighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character of America. I knew then that we Americans could renew this country.
Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Address of the 20th century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that ""more perfect Union"" of our Founders' dream.
We're now at the end of a century when generation after generation of Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming depression, lifting up the disposed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice, building the largest middle class in history, winning two World Wars and the long twilight struggle of the Cold War. We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievement of our forebears in this century. Yet, perhaps, in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we don't see our own time for what it truly is, a new dawn for America.
A hundred years from tonight, another American President will stand in this place and report on the state of the Union. He -- or she -- he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now. So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time but of their time, that we reached as high as our ideals, that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness, that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.
My fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as one nation, and from the mountaintop of this American Century, look ahead to the next one, asking God's blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved country.
Thank you, and good evening.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-11-13,"Okay. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with President Erdoğan and Mrs. Erdoğan. Thank you very much. We very much appreciate you being here. First Lady, thank you very much. And I know you're going to go out to lunch after this. Great honor to have you. The border is holding very well. The ceasefire is holding very well.
We've been speaking to the Kurds, and they seem to be very satisfied. As you know, we've pulled back our troops quite a while ago, because I think it's time for us not to be worried about other people's borders. I want to worry about our borders. We've got plenty of borders to worry about. I want to thank the President for the job they've done.
Again, this has been thousands of years in the process, between borders, between these countries and other countries that we're involved with, 7,000 miles away. So, we want to worry about our things. We're keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind, only for the oil. And I have to just finish by saying that the President and I have been -- we've been very good friends.
We've been friends for a long time, almost from day one. And we understand each other's country. We understand where we're coming from. I understand the problems that they've had, including many people from Turkey being killed in the area that we're talking about. And he has to do something about that, also.
It's not a one-way street. So, I just want to say it's a great honor to have you both and thank you very much. Thank you.
You, go ahead, please. Would you like to say something?
Okay.
Okay, well, that was good. That's good. It's true. A lot of truth to that. I will say, we're also talking about a trade deal. We do, proportionately, very little trade with Turkey. They make great product. We make the greatest product in the world. And, frankly, we're going to be expanding our trade relationship very significantly.
We think we could be doing $100 billion with Turkey. And right now we're doing about $20 billion. But we think that number should be easily $100 billion, which would be great for Turkey and good for us. So, we're going to be expanding. We have our people from Commerce here. That's one of the meetings we'll be having.
And having that big relationship, I think, is a very good one. So, we think we can bring trade up very quickly to about $100 billion between our countries. Okay?
We'll be talking about it, John. We'll talking about the S-400. We'll be talking about that and we'll be talking about the F-35 fighter jet, too.
Turkey is watching the ISIS fighters. When I became President, ISIS was all over the place. I had no idea to the extent. In fact, it was shown to me about a month ago. We came in. It was a mess. And we took over 100 percent of the caliphate. And, last week, as you know, we killed its leader and its founder.
And we're very proud of that fact. And we've also knocked out number two. And we have our eye out on number three, who was supposed to become number one, but he's running right now. He's running for his life, but we have our sights right on him. So, we are -- we're doing very well. ISIS is very much -- very much a factor that's different than it was when I took over.
When I took over, thousands and thousands of ISIS fighters were all over. Now they're mostly imprisoned. I will say, the Kurds are watching over them and Turkey is also watching over them. And Turkey recently has captured over 100 ISIS fighters and they are taking care of them.
Well, John, we're going to be talking about that. So, we'll -- we'll talk about it. We may report to you later on about that because we're having a second meeting in a little while. So, we'll see you in a little while. We're going to be having press conference of sorts in a little while. It's an honor to have the President and Mrs. Erdoğan with us, and they're highly respected in their country and in the region.
And we'll see what we can do. But the relationship that we've had is good. And, you know, I've heard all the pundits -- three, four, five weeks ago. They were against what I've -- what I did. Now, all of a sudden, they're saying, ""Wow. That's really working well. Why are we guarding other country's borders?
We want to take care of our country."" And they're saying it really is surprising what's happened. Plus, we have our troops out of there, and we'll be bringing a lot of them back home. But again, we're keeping the oil. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
Thank you. No, I didn't.
I didn't -- I did not watch it.
I'm too busy to watch it. It's a witch hunt. It's a hoax. I'm too busy to watch it. So, I'm sure I'll get a report.
There's nothing -- there's nothing -- I have not been briefed, no. There's nothing there. I see they're using lawyers that are television lawyers. They took some guys off television, you know. I'm not surprised to see it because Schiff can't do his own questions. Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.
I'll make a decision fairly soon. I was full briefed and I'll make a decision fairly soon.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilat With Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-erdogan-turkey-november-13-2019
Anthony Kershaw,United Kingdom,2020-03-22,"I wish to call the attention of the House to the treatment which overseas students in this country are receiving. I shall argue that the policy of Her Majesty’s Government towards them is unjust, even illegal, and that the consequences are hurtful to the students and harmful to the interests of the United Kingdom.
In fact, it is difficult to know what the policy of Her Majesty’s Government is, because they have not at any time spelt out the basis of their approach. In 1976, the Secretary of State announced various increases in fees, the result of which is that overseas undergraduates pay £650 compared with £500 for home students, and graduates £850 compared with £750 for home graduates.
However, in November 1976 the Secretary of State said that it was her intention, in due course, to remove the fee differential. Even if this is a rather a hollow promise, because fee levels effectively apply almost solely to overseas students since the vast majority of home students have their fees paid by public funds, nothing has yet been done towards fulfilling that promise. The Minister of State last July was only able to say that increases for the coming year would be made to take account of inflation.
We have had inspired Press leaks which indicate that future policy will be towards positive discrimination in which rich students from richer countries will be charged very much higher fees, calculated to produce £120 million in a year, which will be used to subsidise poor students from poorer countries. I ask how it will be possible to determine the real income of students, how it will be possible to make it compatible with the free entry to universities of students other than those nominated by their home Governments. That is something I cannot understand.
How are the countries to be nominated? As someone pertinently asked, are we now to refuse education investment into the United Kingdom from the ​ United States in projects such as those from the Brookings Institute?
How do we stand with regard to the EEC? Are we to continue to charge high fees and to keep on raising them against other countries—against countries such as Germany and France, who receive a far larger number of British students than we take from them and who charge nothing or almost nothing? If those countries retaliate, what will be the effect on our students wishing to go abroad? Has that been considered?
Is the conduct of the Government in this regard compatible with membership of the EEC? The only thing that the Government have done to mitigate hardship is to replace the widely used overseas students fees award scheme with the fee support schemes for postgraduates only. This has proved totally inadequate. The burden of easing hardship has been shuffled off on to local authorities, who are inappropriate for the job, and upon universities and polytechnics, who have struggled to help but without the slightest assistance from Government, except the so-called £1 million divided between universities and the State sector, which was not additional real money but was what would otherwise have been cut. What is certain is that the Government wish to limit the number of overseas students.
The public expenditure White Paper of January 1978 shows the decline in the number of overseas students anticipated, from 52,000 this year to 44,000 in 1981–82, in higher educational establishments, and from 28,000 to 22,000 in non-advanced institutions. Why have these figures not been made public by the Department responsible and justified by argument? Why do we learn of them from a Treasury table? I shall tell the Minister why this is so. These instructions about quotas come from the notorious and largely incomprehensible Circular 8/77. This circular not only imposes quotas but authorises differential tuition fees, local education hostel charges and admission charges. It encourages reclassification of certain categories of immigrant students so that they may be charged higher fees. The circular apparently includes in the quota students who are wholly paid for by their own Government, imposing no charges ​ on the British taxpayer and bringing in investment earnings.
For example, 1,500 Nigerian students are due here in September, bringing in £7 million a year. But they are to be part of the quota, apparently, a quota presumably designed to limit our costs. In fact, they are a profit.
The reason why the Department of Education and Science will not explain its circular and give guidance to LEAs and others is that, paradoxically, it acts not in the name of common sense but for fear of offending against the Government’s Race Relations Act, which was designed to prevent, not promote, discrimination.
I call upon Her Majesty’s Government, who so recently worked themselves up into a phoney lather about immigration and race, to withdraw Circular 8/77, which I say is morally and legally offensive. There sit the racists tonight—in the Department of Education and Science.
The harassment of overseas students is becoming a scandal. Their hours of attendance are checked. They are forbidden to apply for continuation courses until their examination results are through, by which time they may well be too late to apply for the next course.
The Inner London Education Authority, that creature of this Government, fined two London polytechnics £50,000 for accidentally exceeding their quota of overseas students, though I understand that one has now been let off paying that amount. Referring to this shameful incident and to the whole matter, The Times Higher Education Supplement wrote:
“Either they’
—that is, the polytechnics—
“must work an unworkable racist quota, and thus perhaps fall foul of the law. Or they can refuse to work it and be fined.”
In short, overseas students in this country are being treated not as honoured guests but shabbily, as if every one of them was a potential illegal immigrant. This curmudgeonly attitude is directly contrary to the short-term and long-term interests of the United Kingdom.
In the long term, the kind of reception and treatment which students receive here will have an important influence on those who, in later years, will be prominent in the counsels of their countries. Our industrial, cultural and political influence in ​ the world will to some extent depend upon what they have thought of us.
In the short term, the Treasury calculations of the costs of overseas students are manifest nonsense. These calculations appear to take no account of the money which students spend while they are here. The calculations depend upon the total costs of an institution being divided by the number of students to give a cost per head, ignoring that the buildings, the professors and the other overheads would still be there even if not one overseas student came. It is very arguable that, far from there being an expense, there is a net profit from overseas students.
Certainly, the calculations take no account whatever of the academic value to us, especially of post-graduates. Great institutions such as the London School of Economics would be lamed and crippled if their numbers of foreign students were drastically curtailed. It is not only a matter of academic benefits. The material benefits of post-graduate research can be demonstrated to have brought much benefit to us, notably, perhaps, in medicine.
No British student, so far as I have been able to ascertain, has been excluded from a course by too many foreigners. On the contrary—many courses from which British students take benefit could not be kept going without the foreign entry. But even if it were to happen that British students replaced foreign ones, that would bring not savings but extra expense, for we should be substituting subsidised British for fee-paying foreigners. The Government’s argument is economic nonsense, founded upon a false premise and wholly against the interests of this country.
What is to be done? The first thing is to decide who in the end is responsible for policy. At least eight Departments, starting with the Department of Education and Science, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Home Office, have different and conflicting interests and responsibilities in this matter. Someone must be found to take overall charge if the drift is to be stopped.
It is natural to look to the Secretary of State for Education and Science to do this, but she has been a great disappointment. When she came to office she was ​ widely regarded as a person in whom people of differing opinions could place confidence. When she leaves office, as shortly she will, she will be remembered as the best receiver of delegations in the business. Everyone goes away satisfied, but after a bit everyone notices that nothing happens.
The Secretary of State gives the lie to the old saying
“There is no smoke without fire”.
With her, there is nothing but smoke. There is no fire of action, no flame of determination, and apparently no influence in the Cabinet. However, some Department must take the lead, whether the DES or another Department.
My second suggestion is that, as there are so many conflicting influences, a commission of all those professional, academic and voluntary bodies directly interested, perhaps with the right to summon civil servants, should be set up to give advice. Such a body would provide a focal point where the interests of the universities, of educationists generally and perhaps also of this House and of the Government Departments concerned could be thrashed out. The Minister would benefit as a result.
Certain it is that at present Government policy is obscure, unfair and contrary to the interests of this country.
",1978 Speech on Overseas Students,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/anthony-kershaw-1978-speech-on-overseas-students/
Matt Hancock,United Kingdom,2019-06-04,"1.3 million people in the NHS.
If we were a country, we’d be the same size as Estonia. If we were a company, we’d be almost the same size as McDonald’s – but a lot better for you than a Big Mac.
Since I became health secretary I’ve tried to meet as many staff, from as many different parts of the NHS, as possible. Admittedly, meeting 1.3 million people individually is difficult.
I’ve spoken to hundreds of nurses, doctors, paramedics, porters, juniors, seniors, consultants, chief executives. I’ve tried to listen and I’ve tried to listen hard.
And what’s clear is that people are the most valuable asset the NHS has. How we invest in, and look after, our people will determine the future of the NHS.
And that future is so important because the NHS is the most valuable public service we have.
A strong NHS, and strong public services, are the foundations of a strong society. So Britain must continue to be a place where we invest in people because we believe in the potential of people to make things better.
It’s why we appointed Prerana Issar as the first ever NHS Chief People Officer. And it’s why Dido and her team have created the first ever NHS People Plan.
I am extremely grateful to both of them because taking better care of our people is mission critical to the success of the NHS.
Now, I know your time is valuable. So I’m not going to waffle on. And if you saw Good Morning Britain, you’ll know I’ve already been caught out once for too much waffle.
So I’m going to be short today. And I’m going to be direct.
I want to talk to you about 3 people. Three people who illustrate where we’ve come from, where we are now, and where we need to get to.
Recruitment, retention, and an NHS that puts people first.
The first person is a nurse. She, or he, doesn’t live in this country – yet.
They’re in the Philippines, or India, or Poland, or any other number of countries around the world.
They look to the NHS as a beacon of excellence, and of opportunity. Somewhere they can come to, to be the best nurse they can possibly be.
Somewhere they can learn new skills, earn money, and return home as a world-class nurse, or stay and build a new home and a better life here in Britain.
To that nurse I say: we welcome you, we need you, we want you to come and help us build an NHS that’s fit for the future.
Because the National Health Service has always had an international workforce, from the Windrush Generation to the Warsaw Generation.
We must never forget the enormous contribution that people born beyond these shores have made to one of this nation’s greatest institutions.
The People Plan spells out how we need a new Windrush Generation for the NHS. A recruitment drive to attract the brightest and best doctors, nurses, and clinical staff from overseas.
And I want to send a very clear message to those people: if you have the talent, the skills, and the determination to pack up your hopes and dreams in a suitcase and travel to the other side of the world, then the NHS will be your new home.
Our NHS could not provide its world-class service to patients without the hardworking doctors and nurses from other nations.
The second person I want to talk about is a British student.
She, or he, is 18. They’re getting ready for their A-Level exams – hopefully not leaving it as late as I did.
They were born in this century. Technology has shaped every part of their lives from the way they shop, eat, travel, bank, socialise, and even find love.
They have more choice at their fingertips than previous generations would have had in a lifetime.
In fact, there’s so many possibilities that it can be overwhelming. And then a parent, or a perhaps a career adviser, says: “Have you ever thought about becoming a nurse?”
And this 18-year-old thinks: “I’m good at science, I’m interested in people, caring for others would be a rewarding career.”
And then they start to look into it. They start to search online for information.
And what do they see?
Story after story about shortages, about the stresses and the strains, and only the problems.
Never or rarely hearing about the nurses who love their jobs and wouldn’t choose to do anything else, despite the difficulties.
Now, I know there are genuine problems with the system.
That’s why Dido has taken a long-term approach to the first ever NHS People Plan so we can create a new system that puts people first, and is fit for the future.
There are shortages. We use too many agency workers when we should have permanent staff.
The job has become more challenging as the population ages and demand grows.
Your roles are more complex and you need continuous training and new technology to keep up with the pace of change.
But I fear that by only talking about the problems, we risk creating a perception that a career in the NHS isn’t for an ambitious, young, British person. Particularly when it comes to nursing.
Nursing is a first-choice career. An NHS nurse has a passport to anywhere.
In fact, it’s what makes my job so difficult because we can do a lot of things to convince people to stay in the NHS, but I’m afraid we can’t compete with the Australian sunshine.
So we’re putting a record £33.9 billion a year into the NHS – and let’s not forget three-quarters of the NHS budget goes on staff.
We’re opening 5 new medical schools. We’re increasing the number of clinical training places, and we’re increasing the number of routes into nursing through apprenticeships and nursing associates.
But fundamental to delivering the People Plan, and tackling the nursing shortage in the NHS, is changing the perception of nursing as a career.
That way we can get the right number of people and the right type of people in the NHS: talented, ambitious, hard-working, committed to caring.
Third and finally I want to talk about someone who really helped me understand the retention challenge – what it means to you, on the frontline.
He’s a senior consultant at a London hospital. And he said:
Matt, when you join the NHS, everybody knows the deal: you work hard, you do everything you can for your patients and your colleagues, you put everything into the job because at the end of it you know you’re going to get a good pension, but that’s under threat. I can’t plan ahead. I’m afraid to take on extra sessions in case I get an unexpected tax bill, and if I was a few years older I’d be thinking about taking early retirement.
And then he used a graphic but typically medical metaphor to describe the effect it’s having on the NHS. He said:
Right now it’s like a haemorrhage. If we can stop the bleeding in the first 5 or 10 minutes, we can save the patient, but if we don’t, and we leave it, then we’ll be resuscitating the body.
So I understand your frustration. Getting pensions right is how we stem the flow and convince our senior staff to stay in the NHS.
So I’ve listened to you, and I’ve learnt from you, and this is what we’re going to do:
A new pensions deal for senior nurses, doctors and GPs so you have greater flexibility and control over your pension so you don’t get hit with an unexpected tax bill.
A new pensions deal that lets you take extra shifts, go for a promotion, and ultimately rewards you for your hard work and dedication, and encourages you to stay.
We’re going to work with you to change the NHS Pension Scheme so it’s fair to you, fair to the taxpayer, and leads to better care for patients because that must be our goal.
These proposed reforms recognise the unique role and importance of NHS staff. We want to ensure the NHS Pension Scheme continues to be one of the best around so we can continue to attract the best people.
But these reforms must work for you, so we will launch a staff consultation across the NHS next month.
We will have these changes in place by the start of the next tax year. This will allow NHS staff and employers to start planning for the future with confidence and peace of mind.
And it will ensure the NHS is a place where everyone is looked after, and everyone is treated fairly.
Making the NHS a better place to work: that’s where we need to get to. This plan is the first step.
But this journey requires us all to work together: every part of our health service heading in the same direction.
I’ve made it my mission to get the right technology in the NHS so we can make your lives easier, and give you back the gift of time. So you can do what you came into the job to do: caring for people.
The NHS of the future will have more tech, more robots, more AI, but it will always have people at its core.
As the march of the machines removes the jobs that can be replaced by code, so more and more as a society, we’ll need more people doing the jobs no machine can ever do: the caring, the empathy, the connection.
So, we will make the NHS a more caring employer.
We will transform the culture.
The NHS of the future will always put people first.
Because a strong NHS, and strong public services, is how we build a Britain that always put people first.
That is a place we all want to get to.
That’s the country we all want to live in.
So let’s work together to ensure the NHS is a place where everyone feels valued, where everyone feels cared for, and where everyone can fulfil their potential.

Nick Gibb,United Kingdom,2018-03-23,"It is a pleasure to be here in Lisbon at the ISTP 2018, a year on from the successful and fruitful ISTP 2017 in Edinburgh co-hosted by the United Kingdom and Scottish Governments.
Last year, we agreed to promote greater equity through commitments to ensure that:
Every pupil has the opportunity to achieve their potential, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds;
We raise the status of the teaching profession; and
Teaching is firmly grounded in high quality research.
Over the course of the last year, England has continued to make strides in these important areas.
In 2010, the government introduced the English Baccalaureate – known as the EBacc. This is a school performance measure rather than a qualification. It is designed to increase the number of pupils taking core academic GCSEs – English, maths, sciences, a language and either history or geography. These GCSEs provide pupils with the broad academic grounding up to the age of 16 that they need to be successful, whatever route they choose to pursue post-16.
Many countries represented here today will consider it axiomatic that pupils study these subjects to at least the age of 16. But in England in 2010, only 1 in 5 pupils were taking this combination of academic GCSEs. That figure is now almost 2 in 5. The government is ambitious for this figure to rise further – to 90% of year 10 pupils studying the EBacc by 2025.
Already, there are promising signs. This year, we saw the highest proportion of disadvantaged pupils, those who receive free school meals, pupils with special educational needs and pupils with English as an additional language taking these core academic GCSEs.
Not only this, results show that the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers has shrunk at primary and secondary school. Since 2011, the attainment gap at age 11 has decreased by 10.5%. Whilst at 16, it has shrunk by 10% since 2011.
The government is raising standards for all pupils, but the tide is rising fastest for those who need it most.
Academies and free schools – which now make up over 70% of secondary schools and over 25% of primary schools – operate independently of local government.
Free schools are amongst some of the highest performing schools in the country and pupils in free schools made more progress, on average, than pupils in other types of school in 2017.
Free schools are amongst some of the highest performing schools in the country and pupils in free schools made more progress, on average, than pupils in other types of free schools in 2017.
Dixons Trinity Academy – a free school based in Bradford – achieved extraordinary results with its first set of GCSEs, placing it in the 10 top schools in England for the progress achieved by its pupils. Strikingly, the progress score for disadvantaged pupils was higher than for that of their more affluent peers.
But the success of the free school and academy movement is not confined to individual schools. The growth of multi-academy trusts has seen excellence spread across schools. Multi-academy trusts are combinations of academies, from 2 or 3, to as many as 50 or 60 academies, all reporting to one group of independent trustees.
Made up of a combination of schools that have been taken out of local authority control because of that poor performance, which we call sponsored academies; and high performing schools that have voluntarily opted out of local authority control, which we call converter academies; and newly created academies, which we call free schools. These high performing multi-academy trusts demonstrate what it is possible to achieve when power is placed in the hands of high-performing, competitive trusts.
Irrespective of the history of the schools they run, these multi-academy trusts have generated excellent academic results for the pupils they serve, as they compete with other multi-academy trusts in terms of their reputation for academic rigour.
So, the clear advantage of taking schools away from local authority control, is that for the first time, schools are now accountable to their trustees rather than to bureaucracies and there is genuine competition between groups of schools which forces them to respond to the concerns of parents for higher standards of behaviour and stronger academic results.
Thanks to a forensic approach to curriculum design and the implementation of evidence-based approaches to managing poor behaviour, the Inspiration Trust and the Harris Federation – two of the best performing multi-academy trusts – have conclusively demonstrated that all pupils can achieve – whether they live in coastal Norfolk or inner-city London.
They demonstrate that neither the socio-economic context of pupils nor the historic reputation of a school need be a barrier to excellence. And – just as importantly – they provide a model for ensuring that all children succeed. As with Dixons Trinity, schools in these leading multi academy chains are characterised by knowledge-rich curricula, high behavioural expectations and evidence-based teacher-led instruction.
As well as providing the freedom and autonomy to leading free schools and multi-academy trusts, the government is determined to support and empower teachers to raise standards in their schools. The recently closed consultation on how to improve career support and progression for teachers was designed in tandem with the profession. We will respond to the proposals outlined in that consultation – including how we can take forward plans for an Early Career Content Framework – later in the spring. And we will continue to work closely with teachers and teacher representatives on these proposals.
Another key strand of the government’s work to support and empower teachers is the government’s priority of reducing teacher workload. Teachers should be freed from spending hours on marking and entering progress-data, particularly when evidence suggests these do not improve pupil outcomes.
And headteachers need the security of knowing that their autonomy won’t be compromised by rogue school inspectors. That is why the government – in tandem with Ofsted, the schools inspectorate – has been clear on what inspectors will, and will not, ask when they visit schools.
We are also committed to clarifying the roles of different actors within the system, including what we call Regional Schools Commissioners, the 8 regional offices of the Department for Education. In order to provide teachers and headteachers with the opportunity to innovate and raise standards, they need to know that the accountability system within which they work is fair, transparent and – when needs be – supportive rather than punitive.
The government has played an active role in raising standards in schools and in empowering and supporting teachers. But, it is by standing back and promoting teacher voices, that the government has helped to make the most progress in promoting evidence-based teaching.
There is still a long way to go in empowering all teachers with the knowledge they need. But the success of ResearchED – a series of teacher-led research conferences founded by the teacher Tom Bennett now spanning 4 continents – shows teachers’ appetite for research. Tom Bennett wrote recently about the movement of teachers who are dedicating their Saturday’s to discussing and sharing research with one another. Writing powerfully and metaphorically he penned the following:
My ambition is that we start to drive this voluntary professional development, which then cascades back into schools and starts conversations that starts sparks in classrooms that catch fire and burn down dogma. For new teachers to be given skills to discern good evidence from bad. For that to bleed eventually into leadership and from there into the structures that govern us.
But time and again, teachers run up against entrenched views held by those in positions of authority. For example, late last year, an academic from Durham University called the government’s promotion of systematic synthetic phonics ‘seriously flawed’; flying in the face of decades of evidence from around the world that phonics is the most effective method for teaching children to read. He went on to claim that drawing on scientific evidence to inform policy making in science “can be especially dangerous”.
Thankfully, the results from the PIRLS international reading tests came out within a month of these comments. This assessment of 9 and 10 year olds’ reading comprehension showed that England had risen from joint 10th place in 2011 to joint 8th place in 2016, thanks to a statistically significant rise in our average score. And low-attaining pupils had gained most showing again that the government is raising standards for all, but the tide is rising quickest for those who need it most.
These results were a vindication of the government’s evidence-based insistence on the use of systematic synthetic phonics in teaching children to read.
Too often in education, academics use their positions of authority to ignore the evidence and promote their own beliefs. For too long, education has suffered from putting belief over evidence.
As policy makers, if we are to empower teachers to pursue evidence-based approaches, we must confront the evidence as we find it, not as we would wish it to be.
So, when we come to discuss so-called ‘pedagogies of the future’, I hope that we will treat unfounded claims sceptically. Instead, we should discuss the data from PISA 2015, which showed that in all but three countries, higher levels of teacher-directed instruction led to significantly higher science results. And we should interrogate the data showing that in the majority of countries, pupils reporting higher levels of enquiry-based instruction achieved significantly worse results.
As we would expect of teachers, data and evidence should be the starting point for our conversation, not something to fit with our pre-existing conceptions.
But we must not ignore these conceptions. These too must be interrogated and the nuance explored. The caricature of teacher-led instruction as turgid and dull must be dispelled. Rosenshine’s Principles of Instruction make clear that teacher-led instruction should be interactive. These evidence-based principles suggest that teachers, amongst other things:
And the evidence from PISA 2015 supports these findings. According to the data, the most successful science classrooms were those where teachers explained scientific ideas, discussed pupil responses to questions and clearly demonstrated an idea.
Rosenshine’s principles, which draw heavily on cognitive science, are backed up by the PISA 2015 data.
Reflecting on the relationship between researchers and teachers in the conclusion to his 2002 essay Classroom Research and Cargo Cults, E. D. Hirsch – the educationalist who has most influenced my thinking – stressed the need for this relationship to evolve.
Drawing on the comments of a colleague, he laid out his vision for cognitive science research and teaching practice to mirror the relationship between biochemistry and medical science.
In England, it is clear that schools are beginning to take this ambition to heart.
In this pamphlet, titled The Question of Knowledge, Luke Sparkes – headteacher of Dixons Trinity Academy – explained how that school uses cognitive science to inform their curriculum planning:
A knowledge-based curriculum is about harnessing the power of cognitive science, identifying each marginal gain and acting upon it; having the humility to keep refining schemes of work, long term plans and generating better assessments.
Examples such as this show that Tom Bennett is right; teachers demanding better evidence is slowly changing education.
Thank you.
",2018 Speech to the International Conference for the Teaching Profession,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/nick-gibb-2018-speech-to-the-international-conference-for-the-teaching-profession/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-12-03,"Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO. This is our first meeting, meaning my first meeting of this trip. But we've met many times. I think he's doing a fantastic job. I'm a big fan. His contract was extended; I was very happy about that. But you really are -- you're doing a fantastic job.
We appreciate it. I think the Secretary General will tell you that, through some work and some negotiation, we've increased the budget of countries other than the USA, because we're paying far more than anybody else, and far more even as a percentage of GDP. But we've increased the numbers that other countries are paying, by $130 billion.
It was going down for close to 20 years. If you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up. And that was going on for a long time. You wouldn't have had a NATO if you kept going that way. And now we've really increased it incredibly well, and I'm happy to have helped. But the Secretary has been looking to do that for a long time.
And, I can tell you, he's very happy about it. And, just generally, we're going to have a very big couple of days. I believe we're going to have a tremendous couple of days, but very big, very important. We have tremendous spirit, as it pertains to NATO, I would say -- except, perhaps, for one country.
And we'll be talking to that one country. We'll see how it works out. And, actually, the one country has a couple of points, but those points are very devastating to NATO. But we'll find out about that during the next two days. And, with that, I'd like to introduce the Secretary General. Say a few words.
Please.
I loved your statement that we're able to change when the world is changing. And you do have to do that. Your original mission was somewhat different than it is now. Today, the world is a lot different than it was back then. But that's a very profound statement, and it's a statement that everybody has to understand.
It's very -- to me, it's very important. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.
Yes.
I have no thoughts on it. It's going to be a very important election for this great country. But I have no thoughts on it. I will be meeting with him, yes.
I don't know. I have the schedule over here. I have -- I have many meetings. I have meetings set up with lots of different countries.
Who said that?
I know. And then, Turkey responded by saying that he was brain dead, which was interesting. Now, NATO serves a great purpose. It got to be unfair for the United States because the United States was paying a disproportionate amount. And I heard that President Macron said NATO is ""brain dead."" I think that's very insulting to a lot of different forces, including the man that does a very good job in running NATO. No, it has a great purpose, especially with the fact that NATO is becoming much more flexible, in terms of what it looks at. But I was very surprised.
I'd like to ask you: What did you think? He made a statement about NATO being ""brain dead."" What did you think?
It's a tough statement, though, when you make a statement like that. That is a very -- a very, very nasty statement to, essentially, 28 -- including them -- 28 countries. I think that -- you know, you have a very high unemployment rate in France. France is not doing well, economically, at all. They're starting to tax other people's products, so therefore, we go and tax them.
That's just taking place right now, on technology, and we're doing their wines and everything else. And it's -- it's a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in France. You look at what's happened with the yellow vests, or you look at what's going on during certain parts of their season.
They've had a very rough year. And you just can't go around making statements like that about NATO. It's very disrespectful.
Well, I just don't know. Yeah, I just don't know. I haven't seen it. I purposefully stay out of it. We have a great Attorney General. He's a very fair man. He's a great gentleman. He didn't need this job. He took this job because he wanted to do something great for the country. As you know, he was a very successful man.
Picked a great company to work -- when he left, as you know, he picked a great company to work for. But this is a successful man. Didn't need the job. He's doing a great job. I have not seen the report. Perhaps he's read the report. I think he was quoted incorrectly. I do believe that, because I'm hearing their -- the report is very powerful.
But I'm hearing that by lots of different things -- not from inside information; it's really from outside information. I think all we have to do is wait. Isn't it going to be released on Monday -- Monday or so? I think we have to read it and we have to see it. But I hear there's a lot of devastating things in that report.
But we'll see what happens. Look, we have a few days to wait. We've been all waiting a long time. I do think the big report to wait for is going to be the Durham report. That's the one that people are really waiting for. And he's highly respected. And we're -- and he's worked very hard. And he's worked long hours, I can tell you, and gone all over world.
So we'll see. But the Durham report is the report people are really looking forward to. But this is a very important report. The IG report is a very important report. If what I read is correct -- I read it in your newspaper -- if what I read is correct, that would be a little disappointing. But it was just one asset -- one aspect of the report.
We'll see what happens. We'll see it. It's coming out in a few days. I hear it's devastating, but we'll soon find out.
Yes?
Well, I think the Secretary General has done a good job in bringing NATO together. You know, it's been unfair because the United States is paying 4 percent, and some people could say 4.3 percent, of the largest GDP there is in the world, by far, because we've brought it to a level that nobody thought even possible.
So we're paying 4 to 4.3 percent, when Germany is paying 1 to 1.2 percent -- at max, 1.2 percent -- of a much smaller GDP. That's not fair. And it's -- look, it's not -- it's not fair also when you have the European Union -- many of these are the same countries -- but you have the European Union treating the United States very, very unfairly on trade.
The deficit, for many, many years -- for decades -- but the deficit, for many, many years, has been astronomical with the United States and Europe -- in their favor. And I'm changing that, and I'm changing it fairly rapidly. But it's not -- it's not right to be taken advantage of on NATO, and also, then, to be taken advantage of on trade.
And that's what happens. And we can't let that happen. So, we're talking to the European Union, and we're talking to various countries about NATO. But we're talking to the European Union about trade. And they have to shape up; otherwise, things are going to get very tough.
I would say -- I would say that nobody needs NATO more than France. If you just look back over the last long period of time, nobody needs NATO more than France. And, frankly, the one that benefits, really, the least is the United States. We benefit the least. We're helping Europe. Europe unites and they go against a common foe.
That may or may not be a foe; can't tell you that. But there are other foes out there also. But I think nobody needs it more than France. And that's why I think that when France makes a statement like they made about NATO, that's a very dangerous statement for them to make.
Well, look, I'm not in love with those companies -- Facebook and Google and all of them, Twitter -- although I guess I do pretty well with Twitter, on the other side. But I'm not necessarily in love with those companies. But they're our companies. They're American companies. I want to tax those companies.
They're not going to be taxed by France. So France is going to put a tax on them. It was totally out of the blue. He just had the idea. Emmanuel had an idea: ""Let's tax those companies."" Well, they're American companies. I'm not going to let people take advantage of American companies. Because if anyone is going to take advantage of the American companies, it's going to us. It's not going to be France.
And so we're taxing -- as you know, we're taxing their wines and everything else. And we have a very, very big tax to put on them. Plus, we have a tax going on on Airbus, and that'll be a good thing for Boeing. But we're only going to do that if it's necessary. As you know, we won -- in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars.
We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations. And now they realize -- the World Trade Organization realizes that my attitude on them: If they don't treat us fairly, well, I'll tell you someday what will happen. And we've been winning a lot of cases at the World Trade Organization.
We virtually -- very rarely did we ever win a case. They took advantage of the United States. So that's where it is. We won seven and a half billion dollars. And if France puts a tax on our companies -- again, these are companies that are against -- you know, they were against me, if I read the papers correctly.
I don't know why they were against me, but they were against me. They're supposed to be very powerful. And yet, I won. So maybe they're not so powerful. But they're American companies. I don't want France taxing American companies. If they're going to be taxed, it's going to be the United States will tax them.
Okay?
Because I don't want to complicate it. I can -- look, I've won a lot of elections for a lot of people. If you look, just over the last few months: two elections in North Carolina I won; I helped the governor of Kentucky. I mean, the press doesn't write it, but they went up, supposedly, 17, 18, 19 points because of my -- he lost by just a little bit.
But I lifted him 19 points. In Louisiana, I got them into a runoff. And after getting them into a runoff, he picked up 14 points because they thought he was going to lose to a popular governor -- John Bel Edwards. Good guy. Popular governor. He almost won. He lost by less than a point. But with the exception of those two races, where I had a huge impact because I raised them up almost to victory and they had no chance -- with the exception of those two, I've won virtually every race that I've participated in. But this is a different country.
And, you know, I say often: In Germany, they like Obama. The reason they like Obama is because Obama gave the ship away. He allowed them to take everything. He gave them things that I wouldn't do. And I love Germany. I love this country. I love a lot of countries. But I'm representing the U.S. So they may not like me because I'm representing us. And I represent us strong.
President Obama did not represent us strong. He gave everything away, and he shouldn't have done that. And that's why we're still paying a price for what he did. So I'll stay out of the election. You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry the day before Brexit.
You were there; many of you were there. I mean, I recognize that many of you were there. And they asked me whether or not Brexit would happen. I said ""yes,"" and everybody smiled and they laughed. And I said, ""Yes, it's going to happen, in my opinion."" It was just my opinion. The next day, they had the election, and I was right.
But I stay out of it. I think Boris is very capable, and I think he'll do a good job.
Say it?
I think it's fine. I've always had a good relationship with Emmanuel. And sometimes he'll say things that he shouldn't say. And I disagree with some of his policies with respect to France, but he's got to do what he's got to do. And sometimes I think he does things that are counterproductive for his own country.
Say it?
I can work with anybody. I'm a very easy person to work with, you know. You wouldn't believe it. Look at this gentleman. When I came in, I was angry at NATO. And now I've raised $130 billion. And, by the way, you're talking annually. You know, you're talking about a tremendous amount of money. You're talking about --
You're talking about numbers that are astronomical. And yet, you still have many delinquent -- you know, I call them ""delinquent"" when they're not paid up in full. And then, I asked the other question: When they don't pay up in full, what happens to the past year? So let's say Germany is at 1 percent and they stay at 1 percent and another 1. Well, does that mean it disappears over the last five years or if they haven't paid?
You know, nobody has ever asked that question. It's not a bad question for you to be asking. Because, you know, it's not like, ""Oh, gee. Let's start a brand-new year."" A lot of countries haven't paid. And you could make the case that they haven't paid. They're, really, delinquent for 25, 30 years.
And then you add all that up, and NATO is a very rich system. You know that, right? So, you know, they haven't chosen to go that way. But when Germany is at 1 to 1.2 percent, and when they don't pay up to the 2 -- and, let me tell you, the 2 is a very low number. You know, it really should be 4. It shouldn't be 2; it should be 4. But that's the way it is. Yeah.
Please.
I don't think so. You know, I know most of the leaders. I get along with them. It's a hoax. The impeachment thing is a hoax. It's turned out to be a hoax. It's done for purely political gain. They're going to see whether or not they can do something in 2020, because otherwise they're going to lose.
It's turning out -- and you see it better than anybody. I read something in your paper the other day that it's having a reverse effect, which some people thought it might have; I didn't know. But I can tell you, the districts where I won, and then they had an election in between mine -- but they had an election and other people got in; Democrats got in -- those districts are leaning very big toward me. Now, I wasn't in the race in 2018. So it's not really the same thing.
And a lot of my voters say they're not going to vote unless Trump is actually in the race. But it's really having a tremendous impact on -- and a lot of Democrats, I hear, are very upset. They just got back from their district, and I hear they're very upset. The impeachment witch hunt -- it's really just a continuation of the hoax that's been taking place for the last three years.
And I think you know that.
Well, I would say this: I think it's very unpatriotic of the Democrats to put on a performance where they do that. I do. I think it -- I think it's a bad thing for our country. Impeachment wasn't supposed to be used that way. All you have to do is read the transcripts; you'll see there was absolutely nothing done wrong.
They had legal scholars looking at the transcripts the other day, and they say, ""These are absolutely perfect. Trump is right when he uses the word."" Those concept -- those calls that we made -- two of them -- were absolutely perfect calls. And I think it's a very bad thing for our country. Does it cast a cloud?
Well, if it does, then the Democrats have done a very great disservice to the country, which they have. They've wasted a lot of time. We're trying to get prescription drugs reduced very substantially. We could do it easily. They don't have any time to do anything. I call them the ""Do Nothing Democrats."" They are hurting our country very badly.
I may. I may. I have a very good relationship. I may. I -- you know, it could be -- I don't know -- I don't know if it's on the schedule. But if it isn't, I would.
Well, I'd have to ask the other countries. I mean, I have my own views, but I wouldn't say it here. Good relationship with Turkey. We left their border. We've been on their border long enough. They're doing just fine on their border. We kept the oil. I kept the oil. The only people we have over there now -- we have a few that -- a small group that are fighting the remnants of ISIS because they've popped up again and we put them down.
We've defeated the ISIS caliphate. Nobody thought we could do that so quickly. I did it very quickly. When I came in, it was virtually 100 percent. And I knocked it down to 0. I knocked it down to 0. But it pops up every once in a while. So we have a very small group there. And we're -- and we're doing it with others, in all fairness.
But, importantly, we kept the oil. And the oil is what fueled ISIS. That's what fueled them. That's what they -- that's what gave them the economic strength to do what they did. And, of course, we killed al-Baghdadi. And we also killed his second. So that was very important, because he was trying to re-form ISIS.
Say it.
No, not at all. I have nothing to do with it. Never ever thought about it, honestly. We have enough -- Look, we are going to have a great healthcare system. We're doing great healthcare work. We've got things really running well. And if we get -- if we get elected -- if we take the House, keep the Senate, keep the White House -- we'll have phenomenal healthcare.
But right now, we've made it very good. And we have 180 million people on plans that they absolutely love -- private plans that they absolutely love. But in this country -- no, they have to work that out for themselves. We have absolutely -- I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it, and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.
Unacceptable. I did nothing wrong. I heard about it. Now they want to go to censure because they have no case for impeachment, so they want to go to censure. I don't want them to go to censure. I did nothing -- I don't mind be censured if you do something wrong. I did nothing wrong. I had a great conversation, very respectful conversation with the President -- a good person, by the way -- with the President of Ukraine.
It was flawless. People have analyzed it from 15 different ways. It was flawless. You know, there were many people on that line, including the Secretary of State. And one person -- two people had a complaint. And you take a look at those two people, and you tell me. But many people -- and I know there were many people on the line.
I mean, there's always a lot of people when you speak to a head of state. Not only our people, they had people also. Many people, probably. No, I wouldn't be happy with that at all. No. That's -- to me, it's unacceptable. I did nothing wrong. You don't censure somebody when they did nothing wrong. They're in search of a crime -- that's what they are.
They're what you call an ""investigation in search of a crime."" There was no -- not only wasn't there a crime; it's not even a word that should be used. I had a very, very good conversation with the head of Ukraine. And, by the way, yesterday, he came out again and reaffirmed again that we had a very, very respectful, good conversation -- that President Trump did nothing wrong.
He doesn't even really understand what's going on over here. They look at us like, ""Is this country crazy?"" The Democrats have gone nuts. They're crazy. And it's very bad for our country.
Say it?
No, not with us, but I do see France breaking off. I'm looking at him and I'm saying, you know, he needs protection more than anybody, and I see him breaking off. So I'm a little surprised at that.
But the first part of your question, say it again.
Well, it's a country that I happen to have a good relationship with. We did a deal that everybody was very critical of and now they're saying it works. And I read a couple of stories just two days ago that, ""Wow, that deal that Trump did with Turkey"" -- because I want to get our soldiers out of there. I don't want to be policing a border that's been fought over for 2,000 years.
I want to get them out, but I wanted to keep the oil. And now they're saying, ""That was a great deal that Trump made."" I took a lot of heat over that deal. No, I think that, as far as I'm concerned, I like Turkey and I get along very well with the President. And I -- you know, I would hope that he's a very good member of NATO, or will be. But we'll see what it is in the future.
Could I ask you that question?
And I will say this: Three weeks ago, when we got al-Baghdadi, Turkey was very helpful. We flew over areas that were totally controlled by Turkey and the Turkish military. We say, ""We're coming."" They absolutely were very supportive, actually. We didn't tell them what we were doing and where we were going.
Turkey could not have been nicer, could not have been more supportive. And that's important. And I wanted to say that, in keeping the oil, ISIS was trying to, as you know, regain control of the oil. And we have total control of the oil. And, frankly, we had a lot of support from a lot of different people.
But, right now, the only soldiers we have, essentially, in that area, are the soldiers keeping the oil. So we have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want.
Well, they did. And they tried to buy ours, and the Obama administration said, ""You can't have them."" Okay?
The Obama administration said, ""You can't have the Patriots. You can't -- we're not going to sell them to you."" And they said that a number of times. And then Turkey went out and bought the Russian missile. So we'll see what happens. We're still talking about it. But they wanted to buy the Patriots; they tried to buy the Patriots.
I think most of you know that. And they were shut off from buying the Patriots. They were not allowed to buy it. So that puts him in a bind also.
And, as you know, Turkey bought billions and billions -- it was one of the largest orders of F-35s, which is the greatest fighter jet in the world. And all they're going to do now is go to another country, whether it's Russia or China. They don't want to do that; they want to buy the best planes. But, you know, they're making it very difficult for, in a way, themselves, but they're also making it difficult in Washington for them to buy that plane.
But they want to buy. They have a very big order out. They've already put up billions of dollars; they've given it to Lockheed Martin.
Say it?
I'm not even thinking about it. I'm only thinking about this: The impeachment hoax is going nowhere. We have tremendous support. In the history of the Republican Party, there has not been this support. We have 196 to nothing, in terms of votes in the Congress. And as far as I'm concerned, I hear the Senate is angry about -- the Republican senators are very angry about what's going on because they hurt our country.
They're hurting our country -- the other side -- very badly. We have tremendous support. Probably the most united that our Party has ever been. I just had a 95 percent approval rating. It's the highest in the history of the Republican Party. Ronald Reagan was 87; he's second. The Party has never been this united -- the Republican Party.
The impeachment is going nowhere. It is a waste of time. They're wasting their time. And it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace to our country.
Well, that's only -- the only people that are critical are people that haven't read the conversation that I had. And in some cases, they haven't read. Are you okay back there? What happened? You getting into a fistfight or something?
No -- oh, oh. Who is that?
Oh, okay. I thought they got into a little fistfight back there. That's happened a couple of times with you people. No, I think the Republican Party is, right now, more united than they've ever been. When people read the -- I always say, ""Read the transcript."" I also say, ""Take a look at what the President of Ukraine said."" And he said it numerous times, including, very powerfully, yesterday.
Because that's the only thing that really -- that's it. Then you have people heard third-hand, fourth-hand, second-hand. No, we have tremendous support in the Republican Party. There never has been support like this. In fact, I would always complain that the Democrats, I think, are lousy politicians with horrible policy: open borders, sanctuary cities, high taxes -- they want to raise your taxes.
But they've always stuck together. I respect that. And the Republicans, I've always said, have better policy, but, historically, they haven't stuck together the same way. There has never been a time where the Republican Party has been more united. This is a witch hunt by the Democrats. It's a continuation.
It's been going on now for three years. Actually, from before the election it's been going on. You'll probably see that after the report is released on Monday or Tuesday. But this is just a witch hunt that's very bad for our country. But I'll tell you, it's been very unifying for the Republicans and for my base.
I'd rather have you guess. You're a very good reporter. I'd rather have you guess. I'll probably agree with your assumptions.
So, he's a tremendous guy doing a tremendous job. And I would say this: If I thought we were going to lose that seat -- because we shouldn't lose that seat; it's a great state; it's a state that I won overwhelmingly, as you know; we shouldn't lose that state -- then I would sit down and talk to Mike. But you could never find anybody that could do a better job as Secretary of State.
But if we thought we were going to lose that, I would have a talk to Mike. If -- Mike is -- if you look at polling, Mike would walk away with that seat. If I thought there was a risk to losing that seat, I would say that I would sit down very seriously and talk to Mike, and find out how he feels about it. He loves what he's doing.
He's doing a great job, as you know.
Well, China has become very powerful and much more so than in the past. They've done it, largely, with United States money, because our past Presidents allowed them to steal the cookie cutter. And that's okay -- I don't begrudge China for that. I begrudge -- I'm very disappointed in our past Presidents and leadership.
They allowed this to happen. There's no way it should've happened. And, by the way, I'm doing very well in a deal with China, if I want to make it. If I want to make it. I don't think it's ""if they want to make it""; it's ""if I want to make it."" And we'll see what happens. But I'm doing very well, if I want to make a deal.
I don't know that I want to make it, but you're going to find out pretty soon. We'll surprise everybody.
And I think that's important because it's a very different NATO. I mean, this has become -- I really think since I've joined, since I've come in -- we have a very good relationship. This used to be a NATO on one country. They didn't even talk about anything else. And now, really, we are looking at all over the world, because they're -- you know, the world changes.
Seventy years it is; it's a long time. And the world has changed a lot. And I don't think, frankly, before us, that NATO was changing at all with it. And NATO is really changing right now. So it's a different NATO. It's covering a lot more territory. It's covering hotspots. It's covering a lot of things that were never even contemplated or thought of even five years ago.
If you go back five years, they wouldn't even be thinking about the things that we're doing now. So -- and I've become a bigger fan of NATO because they've been so flexible. If they weren't flexible, I think I would probably be not so happy. But they are very flexible, and this gentleman is doing a great job.
Okay?
I will come to Germany, sure. I love Germany. I love the people of Germany.
Well, we'll see. I have confidence in him. I like him. He likes me. We have a good relationship. We'll see. We'll see what happens. He definitely likes sending rockets up, doesn't he? That's why I call him ""Rocket Man.""
But we have a very good -- we have a very good relationship and we'll see what happens. It may work out; it may not. But, in the meantime, it's been a long time. President Obama said it's the number-one problem. And it would've been war; you'd be in a war right now if it weren't for me. If I weren't President, you'd be in a war right now in Asia, and who knows where there that leads.
But that brings in --
-- that brings in a lot of other countries.
Well, you don't know that. Number one, you don't know that. And number two, very importantly, I have met and, in the meantime, we still have peace. We have peace. And at least, speaking for myself, I have a very good personal relationship, and he has with me. I'm possibly the only one he has that kind of relationship with in the world.
They call it the ""Hermit Kingdom."" I know a lot about his ""Hermit Kingdom,"" but I have a very good relationship. If you would've listened to President Obama, we'd be in a World War Three right now. So we'll see what happens. Hey, look -- we are more powerful, militarily, than we ever have been. And I will tell you, when I took over the United States military, when I became Commander-in-Chief, our military was depleted, our military was in trouble.
You know that better than anybody. We had old planes; we had old everything. We didn't have ammunition. Now we have the most powerful military we've ever had and we're by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don't have to use it, but if we do, we'll use it. If we have to, we'll do it. But, you know, my relationship with Kim Jong Un is really good, but that doesn't mean he won't abide by the agreement we signed.
You have to understand. You have to go and look at the first agreement that we signed. It said he will denuclearize. That's what it said. I hope he lives up to the agreement, but we're going to find out. Now, in the meantime, we're working with South Korea because it's burden sharing. And we're spending a tremendous amount of money to protect South Korea, and we think that it's fair that they pay substantially more.
Last year, I asked them to pay more and they agreed. And nobody knows this -- I'll say it now, I think, for the first time -- but they agreed to pay approximately $500 million a year or more for protection. That's $500 million. Now we only had a month or two before the budget ended, so they said, ""No, no, no."" And, you know, they're very good businesspeople; you see how they do on trade.
But they agreed to pay almost $500 million a year more. That got them up to a billion dollars -- close to a billion dollars. That's a lot of money. I did that with a number of phone calls and a meeting. Now, we're negotiating for them to pay more, because the United States is paying a lot of money to protect South Korea and we think it's fair that they pay up and pay more.
We have a very good relationship, but we think it's fair that they pay more. I'm not sure if anybody knows. Did you know about the $500 million that they agreed to pay more?
Yeah. I met with them six, seven months ago -- maybe a little bit longer than that. And I said, ""You're not paying enough. It's not fair."" They were paying $500 -- they were paying less than $500 million a year and it costs us billions. And I said, ""It's not fair. We do a great job. We have 32,000 soldiers there.
It cost us, you know, many times what you're paying. And you have to pay up."" And they said -- again, in a very good way, very fine negotiation. And they were very close to being at the end of their budget, and we agreed to $500 million more, almost -- around $500 million. And that got them up to close to a billion dollars from $500 million -- really less than $500 million, which has been that number for many, many years -- decades.
And I got $500 million more a year. So, it's $500 million a year. That's a lot of money. But it's still substantially less than it costs. So now we're in a negotiation for them to pay more. And they can do that because they're a very rich country.
Did -- you didn't know about that, did you?
Good. I wonder if I'll get a good story for that. I don't think so.
I don't get -- I don't get good stories.
It can be debated. I can go either way. I can make arguments both ways. But I think it's -- I do think this. I think if we're going to do it, I think it's -- you know, they should burden share more fairly. It's not fair for the United States to defend many countries -- not only that country, but many countries where we -- and they're rich countries.
I could tell you there's five other countries that I've had the same conversations with. You know, Saudi Arabia -- we moved more troops there. And they're paying us billions of dollars. Okay? You never heard of that before. You've never heard of that in your whole life. We moved troops and we paid nothing.
And people took advantage and the world took advantage of us. But we do -- we have a good relationship with Saudi Arabia, but they needed help. They were attacked. And, as you saw, we just moved a contingent of troops, and they're paying us billions of dollars and they're happy to do so. The problem is nobody ever asked them to do it until I came along.
Nobody ever asked. Obama didn't ask. Bush didn't ask. Clinton didn't ask. Nobody asked. In fact, they said to me, ""But nobody has ever asked us to do this."" I said, ""I know, King, but I'm asking."" And they're paying us -- they've already sent us billions of dollars. It's already in the bank. So -- and that's right.
And they're happy to do it. But we never had a President who would ask. And it's not right. So -- and we have many other countries that were doing the same thing -- wealthy countries. Now, in some cases, you have countries that need help that don't have money. They're poor and there's tremendous trauma.
There's tremendous problems and things going on that shouldn't be going on. And that's a different situation. But we have wealthy countries -- I've asked Japan. I said to Prime Minister Abe -- a friend of mine, Shinzo. I said, ""You have to -- you have to help us out here. We're paying a lot of money.
You're a wealthy nation. And we're, you know, paying for your military, essentially. You have to help us out."" And he's doing -- he's going to do a lot. They're all going to do a lot. But they were never asked. Now they're being asked.
I think it's a very important point. You understand. I mean, it's a point nobody probably really knows about. I don't talk about it, but this is the first time I've talked about it publicly. But, no, South Korea is paying us almost $500 million more. And now we're starting a negotiation for millions of dollars.
Yeah, very recent.
Well, we've had that discussion and we've had it many times. And they, you know -- I mean, you know their position; you know my position, too. Yeah. It's always -- it's brought up. But, you know, we -- I also brought up -- and I'll bring it up right now -- the fact that Iran is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people, right now, as we speak.
That's why they cut off the Internet. So, they cut off the Internet so people can't see what's going on. But thousands of people are being killed in Iran right now. And, frankly, I don't know how you get in there; I don't know how you do your business -- but the press ought to get in there and see what's going on because the word is that thousands of people are being killed in Iran that are protesting.
And you're hearing that, too. Not just --
Not just small numbers, which are bad; big numbers, which are really bad, and really big numbers.
Well, I'd rather not say right now. But I think it's a terrible thing that I think the world has to be watching. But many people are being killed. You're hearing that, too. Many, many people are being killed in Iran right now for protesting -- for the mere fact that they are protesting. It's a terrible thing.
You're talking about the woman who had the accident with the young man on the motorcycle?
Well, you know, I had his parents up, and they're lovely people. And I've spoken to the woman, who works for government, who has diplomatic immunity. And we're trying to work something out.
Let me tell you, the China trade deal is dependent on one thing: Do I want to make it? Because we're doing very well with China right now and we can do even better with the flick of a pen. And China is paying for it. And China has their worst year, by far, that they've had in 57 years. So, we'll see what happens.
But we're doing very well, right now. And I gave the farmers, as you know, $28 billion and had a lot left over. Because the farmers were targeted by China. I gave them $28 billion over a two-year period, and that got them whole. That was everything that China took out. I gave them from the tariffs that China paid us, and I had billions left over -- many billions left over.
I have no deadline. No.
In some ways, I think it's better to wait until after the election, you want to know the truth. I think, in some ways, it's better to wait until after the election with China.
But I -- I'm not going to say that. I just think that. I'll just tell you: In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now. And we'll see whether or not the deal is going to be right. It's got to be right. Look, China has been ripping off the United States for many, many years.
Again, because of leadership, or lack of leadership, or it wasn't their thing. It's like I told you about the military and the kind of money we're taking in. And, you know, every one of these countries -- these are rich countries I'm talking to. They would always say, ""But nobody has ever asked us to do that."" Like, ""Therefore, why should we do it now?"" I said, ""Well, they haven't because they were foolish, but I am."" And that's where we are.
And that's why -- with Saudi Arabia, with South Korea, with so many other countries -- they're paying a lot of money to the United States that they weren't paying. And they will be paying a lot more.
That's a big story. Right? That's a big story, you.
I don't know -- I don't how you can make that a bad one. But you'll figure a way, right?
I know nothing about the gentleman, really -- Jeremy Corbyn. Know nothing about him.
I think NATO should always be in dialogue with Russia. I think you can have a very good relationship with Russia. I don't think that there is any problem at all with the Secretary General speaking with Russia. I think it's a very important thing to do.
And I have to say this: Russia wants to make a deal on arms control. And I terminated the deal because they weren't living up to it. And it was an obsolete deal anyway. They weren't living up to it. But Russia wants to make a deal. As recently as, like, two weeks ago, Russia wants to make a deal very much on arms control and nuclear.
And that's smart. And so do we. We think it would be a good thing. And we'll also certainly bring in, as you know, China. And we may bring them in later, or we may bring them in now. But Russia wants to do something badly and so do we. It would be a great thing to do.
On who?
No. I don't know Prince Andrew. But it's a -- that's a tough story. That's a very tough story. I don't know him. No. Okay. Anybody else? Thank you. So we'll see you during the next two days. Interesting, right? Huh? A lot of money. A lot of money. Okay. Bye, folks.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Working Breakfast With Jens Stoltenberg of NATO,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-stoltenberg-working-breakfast-london-december-3-2019
Sam Tarry,United Kingdom,2020-05-06,"I apologise for being here in person rather than virtually. I thank the Speaker’s Office for confirming that earlier today. I pay tribute to my hon.​
This week saw a tragic and terrible set of domestic killings in Ilford, just over the border in the constituency of my hon. The full motives that led a father to brutally murder his two very young children before killing himself are not yet known. It brought home to all of us in Ilford, though, the dark reality that in this time of lockdown and isolation, there are too many families and too many victims—more than we may yet be aware of—suffering anguish. Indeed, when I spoke earlier this week to our Metropolitan police borough commander, as I do each week, he noted an approximate 60% increase in DV-related calls to the police in our area.
There will be other people suffering domestic violence who are isolated with a perpetrator and who do not have the space to escape and raise alerts, so there is bound to be under-reporting and I fear what may be revealed when children eventually return to school. After all, children can be the victims of domestic violence. Even if it is not directed at them, the emotional pain of seeing a parent hurt can leave trauma for a lifetime. Barnardo’s says that the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline has increased by 49% and only 5% of those vulnerable children are attending school at the moment. As other Members have mentioned, the charity Refuge has reported that the National Domestic Abuse Helpline experienced a 25% increase in calls during the first week of the covid-19 lockdown and its website has experienced a 700% increase in traffic. That is a truly chilling statistic.
Like many MPs before lockdown, I sat in my non-virtual surgeries and heard heart-wrenching and chilling stories of domestic abuse. Truth be told, I often found it difficult to offer words of comfort in response to some truly harrowing testimonies. All I could do was listen and promise to work my hardest to help them find the housing or the way forward they needed to try to begin to rebuild their lives. Ilford South, as many Members will know, is a constituency of vibrant diversity, but it also has challenges in terms of the provisions needed to tackle domestic violence and abuse.
It is my view that this Bill needs to be expanded to protect all women, regardless of immigration status, to reach the level set out in article 4.3 of the Istanbul convention and recommended by the Joint Committee of MPs and peers who undertook the pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill. Unfortunately, the Government have chosen not to include it at the moment, although they say that they do want to ratify the convention. In my view, and that of many in my constituency, it is unacceptable that migrant women with no recourse to public funds are forced to choose between destitution and remaining with a perpetrator, or risk being treated as an immigration offender if they seek help, instead of getting the protection and support they need. Currently the domestic violence rule and associated access to funds are available only to those on spousal visas. In my view, that needs to be expanded and NRPF abolished so that women and those abused in my constituency can get the support they need, no matter what their status.
There is a great deal of evidence that perpetrators of domestic violence can use immigration status as a coercive tool to control people, to take their liberty and to abuse them. This Bill could and should eliminate that threat. Charities supporting migrants have proposed an ​amendment to introduce a statutory duty on public authorities to ensure that services and support are accessible to all victims of domestic abuse, without discrimination on any grounds, including migrant and immigration status. This would be a welcome step and I hope the Government will listen and ensure that compassion, justice and human rights are not dependent on the status of someone suffering abuse.
",2020 Speech on the Domestic Abuse Bill,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/sam-tarry-2020-speech-on-the-domestic-abuse-bill/
Gordon Brown,United Kingdom,2015-10-02,"Thank you very much. Can I say first of all what a pleasure it is to be here at the University of Greenwich today, to be here with Tessa Blackstone, who does such a wonderful job, to be able to congratulate all those involved with the university for everything that you have achieved, and to be here with people from all the different parts of the world of education, from students, to lecturers, to teachers, to head teachers, to parents – everybody interested in the future of education.
And I do want to congratulate Greenwich University which was inaugurated as Britain’s second polytechnic college many, many years ago, has been an innovator from the start, now a great university with 23,000 students, right at the heart of this local community, going from strength to strength, a great reputation for teacher training, pioneering initiatives to encourage local young people to think about going to university.
And so I believe there is nowhere more appropriate for me to talk about what this government is trying to do, and will try to do in future, to unlock the potential of every child and young person and help every young person in this country make the most of their talents for the future.
My school motto was ‘I will try my utmost’. The motto of the school in the next door town to me, which was at the heart of the mining community in my county was ‘Rise to the light’. And as I have travelled round the country I have seen just how aspirational and inspirational mottos that schools adopt can actually be. ‘No goal is beyond our reach’ – that is the motto of the Business Academy at Bexley; ‘The best in everyone’ – Paddington Academy; ‘Achievement Beyond Expectation’ – Branksome School in Darlington; ‘Excellence through endeavour’ – the Kennet School in Newbury; ‘To strive and achieve is to succeed’ – the Howard School in Medway. And all these school mottos, that they tell us something about the spirit of the age in which they were written they are not in my view simply mementos of the past, they are not just enduring statements of shared beliefs across our communities about the possibilities of progress, they are a declaration of faith in the future, schools saying in their mottos that education should make it possible for young people to bridge the gap between what they are and what they have it in themselves to become. And I believe that these mottos are a promise and a summons, they embody ideals and aspirations and they speak to a guiding belief that I think most of us hold that every child has a talent, every child can learn and so we must nurture and fulfil the potential of all.
Of course some mottos can be misunderstood. Brighton Hove and Sussex Grammar School, its motto was ‘Absque labore nihil’ which is ‘Without labour, nothing’. Funnily enough the school moved to new premises, the old building then became Brighton’s maternity hospital and their motto ‘Without labour, nothing’ was left on the façade.
Now I was fortunate. I went to a school that aimed high, a school that had an ethos of striving, hard work and achievement and that is what I want for every child in the country.
I have said education is my passion. Britain is full of talented people. I believe each young person has talent and potential, each has some gift to develop, each something to give to the good of the community. And the Britain I want to strive for is a Britain with no cap on ambition, no ceiling on hope, no limit to where your potential will take you, how far you can rise, a Britain where the talents of each of us can contribute to the well being and prosperity of all.
And this idea of excellence in education is not just a noble ideal, respecting the search for knowledge, the pursuit of wisdom and the fulfilment of human potential, it is also I think as everybody knows an economic imperative too.
In the past those countries who had the raw materials, the coal or the oil or the basic commodities, or the infrastructure, the ports and the communications, were the ones that had probably the most competitive advantage. Today what matters is who has the skills, the ideas, the insights, the creativity. And the countries that I believe will succeed in the future are those that will do more than just unlock some of the talents of some of their young people, the countries that will succeed will be those that strive to unlock all the talents of all of their people.
Now in the last 10 years we have moved from an education system which was below average in its performance to above average, but we now have to do much more than that. Our ambition must be nothing less than to be world class in education and to move to the top of the global education league, and it is time to say not just that we will aim high but that we can no longer tolerate failure, that it will no longer be acceptable for any child to fall behind, no longer acceptable for any school to fail its pupils, no longer acceptable for young people to drop out of education without good qualifications without us acting.
So no more toleration of second best in Britain, no more toleration of second best for Britain.
And I believe that to achieve that we must confront head on three assertions that I believe have held our country back for too long. The first is an assumption that there is only limited room at the top, that there is no point in educating everyone as far as their talents will take them because the economy simply needs only a few who are trained for the top.
Now I think the fast changing global economy has decisively defeated that argument. Even if in the past there might have been national limited room at the top, now there is clearly global room at the top. Indeed there are millions more skilled jobs and opportunities in our country and round the world for people with skills and qualifications. The young people we educate can and often do work anywhere in any part of the world and there is a virtually unlimited global demand for new talents.
The real challenge that we face is not no room at the top, but no room at the bottom. Unskilled jobs are disappearing. We have 6 million unskilled workers in Britain today, we will need only a half million of these 6 million jobs in 2020, 5.5 million fewer unskilled jobs and this disappearing demand for low skills and no skills and a rising demand for high skills explains why no young person can afford now to leave school without some skill or qualification.
I believe that Britain has often in the past also been held back by a second often heard assertion that ‘more means worse’, that to educate more and more young people is wasteful because they simply don’t have the talent to benefit. And instead of talking of a pool of untapped talent, some people have talked of a pool of tapped untalent.
And each year, even as more young people achieve GCSEs and A’ Levels, even as university and college opportunities are expanded, we often hear echoes of this ‘more means worse’ dogma, the assumption that when you get these results that only some can really achieve high standards and that high achievement in education is by definition limited and exclusive.
And I think this self-imposed limit on the idea about how talent can develop has been an historic curse of the British education system and it does go a long way to explain why too often we fall short of other countries.
Take university access. Other countries are already above 50% for young people going into higher education. Australia claims a graduation rate of 59%, yet many in Britain still say that even to aspire to going up to 50% is a recipe for dumbing down. And the result is that while we have some of the best world class schools and the best world class universities, still too many young people do not get an excellent education. And of course in Britain just 10% of the unskilled workers’ sons and daughters reach university and that is an attainment gap that has to be bridged in the modern world.
And if these notions of ‘more means worse’ are wrong, so too is a related view which is a more fatalist assumption that springs from the denial of aspiration: that there will always be schools that do badly, there will always be pupils who will never do well or even adequately, and when combined with an equally defeatist left of centre assertion sometimes that poor children can never overcome their disadvantage at school, it acquiesces in low expectations and then we put up with coasting and failing schools.
So my argument, and my starting point today, is it is time for Britain to leave behind once and for all this culture of pessimism, any acquiescence in defeatism, any acceptance of low aspirations that holds us back. Poverty of aspiration is as damaging as poverty of opportunity and it is time to replace a culture of low expectations for too many with a culture of high standards for all.
Now that is one of the reasons why in the summer we created a new Department for Children, Schools and Families. We wanted for the first time to be able to support children and young people in the round.
We all know that there are many other influences on our children’s development beyond school, and we all know I think that education must look at the whole picture. So since then the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families has been laying the foundations for the next stage of the transformation of education: how we will focus on classroom standards, ensure that we monitor exam standards rigorously, reform the qualifications system with announcements he has made for the monitoring of that to be independent, mobilise universities and businesses behind school improvement so that all contribute to the education of young people.
And it is building upon these changes that have already been made that I want to spell out what that idea of world-class education could mean for Britain in the 21st century. And I also want to show something more, that only by tackling these old prejudices, ingrained culture of low expectations, and by raising our sights for the future, can we make a reality of equality of opportunity for all children in our country.
In other words I think we need not just education reform to continue and intensify, but we need culture change as well. And what do I mean when I say this? For most of the 20th century the fundamental political divide was between a Left that believed that the extension of state action, command and control structures, could solve social problems and reduce inequality, and then there was the Right that believed that the state had to be rolled back for market forces and market incentives and rewards to be unleashed.
And in the social democratic tradition the state supplied services to people, it built schools, hospitals, houses, provided the funding to run services. But let’s be honest, we paid less attention to how people used these services than the capabilities people need to make the most of the opportunities available to them. We trusted professionals to deliver services, the public to accept them. People were treated sometimes more as passive subjects than as participants in change. The system was content to limit participation in the shaping and direction of public services to voting at election time. In the words of one historian, Peter Clarke, it was about mechanical reform, social change from above, not from below.
And then for its part the right-wing tradition viewed government as an obstacle to market forces, indeed in many ways it still does, reducing human motivation to self-seeking calculations in the market place, relying on civic virtue for charity in areas from where the state is then withdrawn.
I think we can say today that both of these positions are inadequate. We need both strong public services and we need a dynamic market economy to have a fair and prosperous society. Arguments about the size of the state and the funding of public services mark important dividing lines in politics, investment in public services in my view is absolutely critical. But we don’t believe in a zero sum game in which there is only one winner between state and market forces in advanced economies. Each, markets and government, have their place. Prosperity results from drawing upon the best strengths in each of them.
But that is not the end of the matter. For what those who placed their faith in either state or market too often ignored, is culture: the motivation, the values, the habits that influence us all in our daily lives, that influence our families and our communities. These are the values we share, the aspirations we have, the boundaries we set as communities between what is acceptable and unacceptable.
And I think we can now see that culture change is critical to achieving success in reforming public services, true in almost every area of public policy: preventative local health, to social care, community policing, tackling climate change. When we see that equality of opportunity can work to best effect, when people believe, such as on the environment, that they can improve things for themselves and are aspirational about what they want to achieve.
Public services can no longer be delivered to people without their engagement in them. Whether we aim to reduce carbon emissions or tackle obesity, or empower those people who are receiving social care, change will always be more effective if people participate and play their part.
So the bad news for the old thinking on both Left and Right is that culture matters. The good news is that cultures can change. And it is by promoting cultural change that we will ensure that many of the values that we share come alive in this 21st century.
So I think our goal must be simultaneously to expand opportunity, not just one chance but second, third and fourth chances for people throughout their lives, to raise the aspirations that people have to grasp these opportunities, that is the key to unlocking talent, and to develop people’s capabilities to participate in shaping the future so that services are personal to each but also shaped by people themselves.
On its own, equality of opportunity can never be enough. Opportunities are only meaningful if people have the capabilities, the resources, the aspirations to make the most of them. So inequalities in aspiration and in the capability to benefit from them must be tackled also. Without doing that fairer outcomes, the fairness which will shape the opportunities of the generations to come will not be achieved. But if we can expand opportunity, aspiration and participation together, then outcomes for pupils, parents and citizens will be fairer, the result of the choices we make, the hard work and effort we put in – not imposed by the accident of birth or the brute luck of circumstances. And it is in this way I think we will create a stronger, fairer society with excellence within the reach of everyone and not just the few. Talent nurtured, effort rewarded, the merit of each in the service of all.
Now what does that mean for how we move forward with our schools and our education?
Aspiration matters in every aspect of education: the aspirations of parents for their children from their very earliest years; the aspirations of young people, whether they are going to seize the opportunities available to them; the aspirations of course of teachers, of schools, of local government setting high expectations for achievement; the aspirations of society placing the highest possible cultural value upon learning itself; and of course aspirations of government that sets long term ambitions and matches those ambitions with the necessary investment over the long term to realise them.
Now just consider the evidence. We now know the level of parental engagement in learning is actually more important in determining a child’s educational achievement than the social class background, the size of the family or the parent’s own educational attainment. A child with a stimulating home environment does better on all the scores of early childhood development.
Conversely we know for example that teenage pregnancy is significantly more likely amongst girls whose mothers have low expectation for their education, even after controlling for other socio-economic factors.
Aspiration matters. But we have barely set out on the journey of involving parents in the education of their children and encouraging high aspirations as an explicit and central goal of policy.
Parents are worried about discipline, about bullying, about schools where children’s lessons are disrupted, and where there is not enough of a school ethos for learning to flourish and all children to succeed.
And I share all of these concerns. If we ask parents to get more involved in the education of their children, in the lives of their schools, we have to respond to these concerns, just as parents for their part need to reinforce the expectations for good discipline and the boundaries of acceptable behaviour set by head teachers for their schools.
So let us do more now to involve and engage parents at every stage of the journey of their children’s education, spread the best practice of the best schools, more regular real time feedback about their children’s progress, regular emails, regular meetings, more parent sessions at schools, to share information and to set goals at key transition points for children.
But it is not just parental involvement that can be expanded, young people’s aspirations matter too. In many ways the greater failure is not the child who doesn’t reach the stars, but the child who has got no stars that they feel they are reaching for.
And as every teacher knows, you can’t educate those you can’t easily motivate. But we know sometimes that helping boys in particular to aspire and aim higher comes up against in schools boredom, distraction, disaffection, a sense the classroom isn’t for them, the downward pull of peer pressure. So we have also to raise boys’ aspirations in education, provide education that can enthuse and engage, provide different opportunities for different kinds of vocational learning as young people prepare for the transition to the world of work.
And that lies behind much of what we are doing in diplomas. The very idea of personalised learning is about helping children become more aspirational, that we identify talent, we shape education around the unique needs and aspirations of every child, we engage pupils in their own learning and we give them a thirst for education and knowledge that will stay with them long after they have left school.
So we will expand our Gifted and Talented Learning Programme for children at school. We will give a million of our most talented children the opportunity to benefit from special and stretching tuition, we are boosting activities in those areas which can unlock so many different forms of talent: sport, music, the arts, culture, enterprise. We will continue to increase the number of student ambassadors from universities who work in schools: there are now 7,000 helping promote the benefits of higher education to younger pupils when they are still at school. And we will build on what is called our Aim Higher Programme so we increase the aspiration of many to go to university, just as universities are now encouraged to reach out into the schools and colleges, hold summer schools and other events to help lift young people’s sights towards higher education.
And because raising aspirations is at the heart of raising standards we will ask the National Council for Educational Excellence to work with schools and universities, the Sutton Trust and other organisations in this field, to report on how we can increase applications to universities from schools in disadvantaged areas.
So raising aspiration, encouraging the participation of parents and students is at the heart of our approach. But direct action to raise standards and to address failure is also fundamental.
I think we have come a long way in the last decade. Ten years ago there were no children’s centres like Sure Start, there were no nursery places for 3 year olds, there was no literacy hour in our primary schools, no guaranteed sports, arts and modern languages, no extended schools, no trust, specialist or academy schools in every area. There were no educational maintenance allowances so young people found it difficult in some areas to stay on in education beyond 16. There were few new school buildings which now today stand as beacons of aspiration, particularly in low income communities.
Now all of this, and more, has been achieved. But now as we develop what will be our 10 year Children’s Plan we need to move to the next stage in the transformation of standards in education in Britain, rising to the challenge of world class excellence.
Across the globe, as everybody knows, education standards are rising. Other countries will not stand still and are pushing forward and they are pushing forward the frontier of what a 21st century education can offer. Take Canada, or Finland, or Hong Kong. Almost all the children there achieve the required standard of literacy by 11. In Finland every teacher has to have a Masters Degree and 10 people apply for every place on a teacher training course. In South Korea only the brightest and the best are selected to enter the teaching profession. In Chicago, Boston and New York education leaders are now taking a systematic and relentless approach to tackling failing schools.
So the world is moving at this restless pace to transform education. And what appears to be world class now will soon of course appear to be second class in 10 or 20 years time. And that means that the strategic choices that we make today are going to be critical for our long term prosperity.
So I want us to learn all the lessons of excellence from round the world, that the very best education systems start with high quality affordable daycares and early learning, as in Scandinavia where children start school ready to learn because they have had excellent and highly professional pre-school care and development.
But as Michael Barber has shown, the best education systems recruit the best people into teaching – the top 5% in South Korea, the top 10% in Finland, the top 30% in Singapore and Hong Kong. In excellent schools the teachers receive continuous training and professional development to update their skills and expertise, and there is always strong leadership from head teachers with the autonomy to lead their schools. World class education, we know, achieves high standards for 100% of the children when there are systems of accountability, funding and pupil tracking that leave no child behind and personalised learning is tailored to the unique potential of every child with one-to-one tutoring and support. That world class education depends on a systematic intolerance of failure and a preparedness of public authorities to intervene and to innovate to eradicate failure; and in leading economies of course participation in learning or education is near universal up to the age of 18, skills investment is high and rising, and in all successful countries entry to universities and colleges is rapidly increasing.
So we must renew our ambitions also. And we will build on the improvements we have made in early years by extending entitlements to free nursery education, we will improve the quality of childcare and early learning, we should aspire to match the excellence we know exists particularly in the Scandinavian countries in early learning and daycare.
And then we will raise still further the status and standards of teaching. Everybody remembers an inspirational teacher, everybody knows that a good teacher makes all the difference, and there are many good teachers here this morning. And that is not just my personal experience but the personal experience I find when I talk to many people.
And research is absolutely conclusive about the importance of teaching standards. If you take a group of 50 teachers, a child taught by one of the best 10 will learn sometimes at twice the speed of a child taught by one of the worst 10. Teaching quality is that important.
Ofsted say we now have the best teachers ever in our schools today and they should be valued and applauded for their work. And now our goal should be even bolder, to have a world class teaching profession for all our pupils within a generation.
So we will do more to raise the quality of recruits into teacher training, we will expand routes into training for talented people in mid and late career with ‘Teach First’ followed by ‘Teach Next’ so that people can move into a teaching job later in career. We will build on these reforms with the aim of raising still further the status of teaching in Britain. We will match the rigorous selection of the brightest and best into teacher training that other countries are achieving and we will promote graduate opportunities for teachers to undertake professional training and development linked to performance assessment.
And this is my belief: that world class performance comes from consistent brilliance from teachers in every classroom, professionals who always seek continuous improvement; who teach better lessons tomorrow than they did yesterday because they are learning all the time; who when a pupil falls behind don’t assume it is a lack of ability but instead ask: how could I teach that material better to enable my pupil to master that?
And that is the challenge, we know, for the best teachers and we will assist them in rising to it.
But we should also work on the principle of social justice for all, that no child should be left out or lose out, that as we raise standards we also narrow the social gap attainment in education and that every child should be given the best chance to progress as far and as fast as they can.
And we have improved standards of schools in disadvantaged areas, but we have not made enough progress in closing the gap between individual pupils from different backgrounds. A ‘no child left out’ education system must work for 100% of the pupils 100% of the time, and that is a major undertaking for this generation.
So what accountability there is and what progress targets we have must prioritise success for all.
Now in primary education every child should reach the expected level in literacy and numeracy. If the best in the world can do it now, so should we. For those who say it is not possible, I say visit West Dunbartonshire, one of the most disadvantaged parts of Scotland. Ten years ago it took the decision to eradicate illiteracy in primary schools. In 2001 almost 1 in 3 left primary school functionally illiterate. Last year only 6% did so. Through sustained ambition, intensive intervention at every level it is on track to wipe out pupil illiteracy this year after a decade of raising standards for children.
And if West Dunbartonshire – one of the poorest parts of the country – can do it, so can the rest of the country. It means one-to-one catch-up in the 3 Rs to every pupil who needs it, with early intervention, ‘Every Child a Reader’, ‘Every Child Counts’, the new programme that Ed Balls has just introduced, ‘Every Child a Writer’.
And it means better school-based social and behavioural support for children with extra needs, building on the ‘Every child matters’ agenda.
And then for secondary school it must mean all pupils making good progress with setting by ability, stronger classroom discipline and real commitment to personalised learning. More one-to-one tuition, small group teaching, a personal studies tutor for secondary schools, more support for innovative teaching and learning strategies.
And we all know that the best schools already achieve superb results with personalised learning, the best schools are well led with innovative ideas, they increasingly operate as networks that link schools together and they spread best practice from school to school. And our goal must be a service that has the capacity and space to innovate and to personalise learning.
And as we start to move to personalised testing we must keep assessment under review to ensure it supports learning and achievement, and does not dominate teaching.
Every child is entitled to a decent school and a good education. So we must also put an end to failure. We have cut the number of failing schools dramatically in the last decade. In 1997 over 600 secondary schools had less than 25% of children getting 5 or more good GCSEs. Now instead of over 600, 26 do. But the latest figures still show that there are 670 schools where less than 30% of pupils get 5 A star to C grades at GCSE, including English and maths, and while that is down from 1,600 in 1997 there is still much to do.
So we must go further to end failure. And the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families has challenged local authorities to use new powers and this is a critical strategic role and challenge for local government.
In the next 5 years we will work to get all schools above 30% A star – C grades at GCSE, including in English and maths. And let’s be clear, many of these schools below this threshold are already improving, many have strong and determined leaders, many face the toughest challenges in our education system and we have to use the right mix of intervention and support to raise standards.
So we have put in place now a systematic plan of ever tougher measures for eradicating failure. It will start with annual improvement targets for all schools that are falling below the required threshold. There will be new incentives for the best teachers to teach in the toughest schools, including expanding the ‘Teaching First’ and ‘Teach Next’ programmes to have the best possible teacher intake for these schools.
Good schools will be brought in to help poorer schools under improvement networks that will be run by schools for schools, as the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust motto puts it. Warning notices to trigger intervention powers will include new interim executive boards to take over school management where there is failure. Complete closure or takeover by a successful neighbouring school in a trust or federation or transfer to academy status, including the option of taking over by an independent school will be an available power.
And there will be 150 more academies in the next 3 years, on route to our target of 400; more universities working with us to set up academies; more local authorities doing what Manchester, Birmingham, Oldham and others are doing – putting academies at the heart of their local school improvement plans; more independent schools setting up academies to take over failing schools.
And this is therefore a determined and systematic agenda to end failure that we will see through and we will not flinch from this task.
And our final goal for world class education for young children will be 100% success for young people to make the transition from school to college, to university or to skilled work. And every young person should know that they have something to aim for in their education. So at age18 or 19, each should graduate from school, college or an apprenticeship with good qualifications or a certificate on the way.
We have set out in the last few days a new vision for diplomas, designed alongside and with universities and businesses to meet the needs of the new century. And alongside the diplomas, as they grow in excellence we plan a radical overhaul of apprenticeships too. A new matching service, rather like the UCAS university service, so that young people in any area can be matched up with businesses that are wanting and offering apprenticeships in every area of the country; a widening of the number of employers who now join the apprenticeship programme and we build on the 130,000 employers in all parts of Britain who have signed up for apprenticeships; we make the public sector a better partner, which it hasn’t always been, in apprenticeships, including changes in Whitehall itself; and we place a legal duty on the Learning and Skills Council to provide sufficient apprenticeship places in every area so that we can end a situation in which there can be only 95 apprenticeships completed in Hackney but over 2,500 today in Hampshire.
And to drive aspirations up we will ensure that all those reaching 18 or 19 who want to go on to an advanced apprenticeship or further education and training have the resources they need.
Just as from this year two-thirds of university students will be able, under changes that we have announced, to apply for grants of up to £3,000, so too advanced apprentices will have a credit of at least £3,000 through a Skills Account to pay towards their costs. And from this year we are paying the college fees of young people up to the age of 25 studying the equivalent of A levels and giving access to an adult learning grant of £30 a week.
And all of this is possible against the backdrop of the legislation to extend training or education to the age of 18 by 2015 to bring us in line with the rest and the best in the world. We will offer financial support for those who could not otherwise afford to stay in education. We will not insist that young people stay in the classroom. They will be able to choose from clear pathways into the future: further study at school or college, an apprenticeship or work with time off for training.
And in the coming week the Secretary for Children, Schools and Families will bring forward his action plan to ensure that all young people are in education, jobs or training and we will offer new rights to young people matched by that new duty to be in education until 18.
And because we cannot afford to leave any young person behind outside work or study, and because we owe it to them to equip them for the world they are growing up into, this will be a priority of the government that every young person is offered a route forward in education as they grow from their teens into their 20s.
I make no apology therefore for saying that education is the best economic policy, and I make no apology for wanting every child and young person to be able to read, write and add up. But as we all know education has always been about more than exams, more than the basics, vital as they are and will continue to be. To educate, as we know, is to form character, it is to shape values, it is to liberate the imagination, it is to pass human wisdom, knowledge and ingenuity from one generation to the next, it is a duty and a calling.
As was said by one of the ancient philosophers, the mind is not a vessel to be filled, it is a fire to be kindled. And that is why we have such high ambitions. Not just because education is a matter of national prosperity, it is certainly that, it is because education is the great liberator, the greatest liberator mankind has ever known and the greatest force for social progress.
That is why it is my passion. That is why I want to see a Britain where every child can go to a world class school, supported by high aspirations and surrounded always by excellent opportunities. And that is why I want to see a Britain where every family has the right to participate in the education of their child and is encouraged with every chance to do so. And that is why too I want a Britain where every young person can see ahead of them a goal in life, the support they need to get there, and it is a Britain therefore where effort is rewarded, ambition fulfilled, potential realised, a Britain of high aspirations and a Britain of all the talents. And I ask all of you to enlist in this cause.
Thank you very much.
",2007 Speech on Education,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/gordon-brown-2007-speech-on-education/
John F. Kennedy,United States of America,1961-06-06 00:00:00,"Good evening, my fellow citizens: I returned this morning from a week-long trip to Europe and I want to report to you on that trip in full. It was in every sense an unforgettable experience. The people of Paris, of Vienna, of London, were generous in their greeting. They were heartwarming in their hospitality, and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated. We knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented, which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom. Equally memorable was the pageantry of European history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception, to lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe, to dine at Versailles, and Schonbrunn Palace, and with the Queen of England. These are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come. Each of the three cities that we visited--Paris, Vienna, and London--have existed for many centuries, and each serves as a reminder that the Western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years, and has defended itself over many centuries. But this was not a ceremonial trip. Two aims of American foreign policy, above all others, were the reason for the trip: the unity of the free world, whose strength is the security of us all, and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace. My trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims. To strengthen the unity of the West, our journey opened in Paris and closed in London. My talks with General de Gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me. Certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom. Our alliance, I believe, became more secure; the friendship of our nation, I hope--with theirs--became firmer; and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer, and I hope were marked by confidence. I found General de Gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position, whether or not it was his own, than in appearing to agree with him when we do not. But he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance. He is after all the only major leader of World War II who still occupies a position of great responsibility. His life has been one of unusual dedication; he is a man of extraordinary personal character, symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of France. Throughout our discussions he took the long view of France and the world at large. I found him a wise counselor for the future, and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make. Thus we had a valuable meeting. I believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time--I believe were removed on both sides. Problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away. No question, however sensitive, was avoided. No area of interest was ignored, and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future--in our agreement on defending Berlin, on working to improve the defenses of Europe, on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world, including Latin America, on spurring European economic unity, on concluding successfully the conference on Laos, and on closer consultations and solidarity in the Western alliance. General de Gaulle could not have been more cordial, and I could not have more confidence in any man. In addition to his individual strength of character, the French people as a whole showed vitality and energy which were both impressive and gratifying. Their recovery from the postwar period is dramatic, their productivity is increasing, and they are steadily building their stature in both Europe and Africa, and thus, I left Paris for Vienna with increased confidence in Western unity and strength. The people of Vienna know what it is to live under occupation, and they know what it is to live in freedom. Their welcome to me as President of this country should be heartwarming to us all. I went to Vienna to meet the leader of the Soviet Union, Mr. Khrushchev. For 2 days we met in sober, intensive conversation, and I believe it is my obligation to the people, to the Congress, and to our allies to report on those conversations candidly and publicly. Mr. Khrushchev and I had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries. I will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days. There was no discourtesy, no loss of tempers, no threats or ultimatums by either side; no advantage or concession was either gained or given; no major decision was either planned or taken; no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended. This kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full-fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers, where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought, but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting, nor did we plan any future summit meetings at Vienna. But I found this meeting with Chairman Khrushchev, as somber as it was, to be immensely useful. I had read his speeches and of his policies. I had been advised on his views. I had been told by other leaders of the West, General de Gaulle, Chancellor Adenauer, Prime Minister Macmillan, what manner of man he was. But I bear the responsibility of the Presidency of the United States, and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me. It is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible, that they are based on as much direct, firsthand knowledge as possible. I therefore thought it was of immense importance that I know Mr. Khrushchev, that I gain as much insight and understanding as I could on his present and future policies. At the same time, I wanted to make certain Mr. Khrushchev knew this country and its policies, that he understood our strength and our determination, and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind. I wanted to present our views to him directly, precisely, realistically, and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification. This was done. No new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side. The gap between us was not, in such a short period, materially reduced, but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully, at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less, and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact. This is important, for neither of us tried to merely please the other, to agree merely to be agreeable, to say what the other wanted to hear. And just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross-examination, instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper, so, too, was this direct give-and-take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital, for the facts of the matter are that the Soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words--war, peace, democracy, and popular will. We have wholly different views of right and wrong, of what is an internal affair and what is aggression, and, above all, we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going. Only by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that Mr. Khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future. Our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood. Neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests. But both of us were there, I think, because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other, that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible, since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine, and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued. We believe in a system of national freedom and independence. He believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism, and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends. However difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests, I think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort. That is why I considered the Vienna talks to be useful. The somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation, nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear. It simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as Americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty. The one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was Laos. Both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation. Both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent Laos, much in the manner of Burma or Cambodia. Of critical importance to the current conference on Laos in Geneva, both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease-fire. It is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at Geneva, enabling the International Control Commission to do its duty, to make certain that a cease-fire is enforced and maintained. I am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at Geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere. No such hope emerged, however with respect to the other deadlocked Geneva conference, seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests. Mr. Khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator--in his opinion because no one was truly neutral; that a Soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement; that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage, in the absence of total disarmament; and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile. In short, our hopes for an end to nuclear tests, for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons, and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow. Nevertheless, the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at Geneva. But our most somber talks were on the subject of Germany and Berlin. I made it clear to Mr. Khrushchev that the security of Western Europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to West Berlin, that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance, and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk, and thus meet our obligation to the people of West Berlin, and their right to choose their own future. Mr. Khrushchev, in turn, presented his views in detail, and his presentation will be the subject of further communications. But we are not seeking to change the present situation. A binding German peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with Germany, and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of West Berlin. Generally, Mr. Khrushchev did not talk in terms of war. He believes the world will move his way without resort to force. He spoke of his nation's achievements in space. He stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production, to out-trade us, to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours. Most of all, he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries. He was certain that the tide there was moving his way, that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a Communist revolution, and that the so-called wars of liberation, supported by the Kremlin, would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion. In the 1940's and early fifties, the great danger was from Communist armies marching across free borders, which we saw in Korea. Our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas. Now we face a new and different threat. We no longer have a nuclear monopoly. Their missiles, they believe, will hold off our missiles, and their troops can match our troops should we intervene in these so-called wars of liberation. Thus, the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrillas or insurgents or subversion. A small group of disciplined Communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be $60 or $70 a year, and seize control, therefore, of an entire country without Communist troops ever crossing any international frontier. This is the Communist theory. But I believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong, that liberty and independence and self-determination--not communism-is the future of man, and that free men have the will and the resources to win the struggle for freedom. But it is clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poorer nations will be a continuing crisis of this decade. Mr. Khrushchev made one point which I wish to pass on. He said there are many disorders throughout the world, and he should not be blamed for them all. He is quite right. It is easy to dismiss as Communist-inspired every anti-government or anti-American riot, every overthrow of a corrupt regime, or every mass protest against misery and despair. These are not all Communist-inspired. The Communists move in to exploit them, to infiltrate their leadership, to ride their crest to victory. But the Communists did not create the conditions which caused them. In short, the hopes for freedom in these areas which see so much poverty and illiteracy, so many children who are sick, so many children-who die in the first year, so many families without homes, so many families without hope--the future for freedom in these areas rests with the local peoples and their governments. If they have the will to determine their own future, if their governments have the support of their own people, if their honest and progressive measures--helping their people--have inspired confidence and zeal, then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed. But where those conditions do not exist, a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offers little protection against internal decay. Yet all this does not mean that our Nation and the West and the free world can only sit by. On the contrary, we have an historic opportunity to help these countries build their societies until they are so strong and broadly based that only an outside invasion could topple them, and that threat, we know, can be stopped. We can train and equip their forces to resist Communist-supplied insurrections. We can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standards can be built. We can encourage better administration and better education and better tax and land distribution and a better life for the people. All this and more we can do because we have the talent and the resources to do it, if we will only use and share them. I know that there is a great deal of feeling in the United States that we have carried the burden of economic assistance long enough, but these countries that we are now supporting-stretching all the way along from the top of Europe through the Middle East, down through Saigon--are now subject to great efforts internally, in many of them, to seize control. If we're not prepared to assist them in making a better life for their people, then I believe that the prospects for freedom in those areas are uncertain. We must, I believe, assist them if we are determined to meet with commitments of assistance our words against the Communist advance. The burden is heavy; we have carried it for many years. But I believe that this fight is not over. This battle goes on, and we have to play our part in it. And therefore I hope again that we will assist these people so that they can remain free. It was fitting that Congress opened its hearings on our new foreign military and economic aid programs in Washington at the very time that Mr. Khrushchev's words in Vienna were demonstrating as nothing else could the need for that very program. It should be well run, effectively administered, but I believe we must do it, and I hope that you, the American people, will support it again, because I think it's vitally important to the security of these areas. There is no use talking against the Communist advance unless we're willing to meet our responsibilities, however burdensome they may be. I do not justify this aid merely on the grounds of anti-Communism. It is a recognition of our opportunity and obligation to help these people be free, and we are not alone. I found that the people of France, for example, were doing far more in Africa in the way of aiding independent nations than our own country was. But I know that foreign aid is a burden that is keenly felt and I can only say that we have no more crucial obligation now. My stay in England was short but the visit gave me a chance to confer privately again with Prime Minister Macmillan, just as others of our party in Vienna were conferring yesterday with General de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer. We all agreed that there is work to be done in the West and from our conversations have come agreed steps to get on with that work. Our day in London, capped by a meeting with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip was a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the West remains united in its determination to hold to its standards. May I conclude by saying simply that I am glad to be home. We have on this trip admired splendid places and seen stirring sights, but we are glad to be home. No demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which you, the American people, have so generously given to our country. With that support I am not fearful of the future. We must be patient. We must be determined. We must be courageous. We must accept both risks and burdens, but with the will and the work freedom will prevail. Good night, and thank you very much. Good evening, my fellow citizens: I returned this morning from a week-long trip to Europe and I want to report to you on that trip in full. It was in every sense an unforgettable experience. The people of Paris, of Vienna, of London, were generous in their greeting. They were heartwarming in their hospitality, and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated. We knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented, which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom. Equally memorable was the pageantry of European history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception, to lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe, to dine at Versailles, and Schonbrunn Palace, and with the Queen of England. These are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come. Each of the three cities that we visited--Paris, Vienna, and London--have existed for many centuries, and each serves as a reminder that the Western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years, and has defended itself over many centuries. But this was not a ceremonial trip. Two aims of American foreign policy, above all others, were the reason for the trip: the unity of the free world, whose strength is the security of us all, and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace. My trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims. To strengthen the unity of the West, our journey opened in Paris and closed in London. My talks with General de Gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me. Certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom. Our alliance, I believe, became more secure; the friendship of our nation, I hope--with theirs--became firmer; and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer, and I hope were marked by confidence. I found General de Gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position, whether or not it was his own, than in appearing to agree with him when we do not. But he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance. He is after all the only major leader of World War II who still occupies a position of great responsibility. His life has been one of unusual dedication; he is a man of extraordinary personal character, symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of France. Throughout our discussions he took the long view of France and the world at large. I found him a wise counselor for the future, and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make. Thus we had a valuable meeting. I believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time--I believe were removed on both sides. Problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away. No question, however sensitive, was avoided. No area of interest was ignored, and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future--in our agreement on defending Berlin, on working to improve the defenses of Europe, on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world, including Latin America, on spurring European economic unity, on concluding successfully the conference on Laos, and on closer consultations and solidarity in the Western alliance. General de Gaulle could not have been more cordial, and I could not have more confidence in any man. In addition to his individual strength of character, the French people as a whole showed vitality and energy which were both impressive and gratifying. Their recovery from the postwar period is dramatic, their productivity is increasing, and they are steadily building their stature in both Europe and Africa, and thus, I left Paris for Vienna with increased confidence in Western unity and strength. The people of Vienna know what it is to live under occupation, and they know what it is to live in freedom. Their welcome to me as President of this country should be heartwarming to us all. I went to Vienna to meet the leader of the Soviet Union, Mr. Khrushchev. For 2 days we met in sober, intensive conversation, and I believe it is my obligation to the people, to the Congress, and to our allies to report on those conversations candidly and publicly. Mr. Khrushchev and I had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries. I will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days. There was no discourtesy, no loss of tempers, no threats or ultimatums by either side; no advantage or concession was either gained or given; no major decision was either planned or taken; no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended. This kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full-fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers, where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought, but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting, nor did we plan any future summit meetings at Vienna. But I found this meeting with Chairman Khrushchev, as somber as it was, to be immensely useful. I had read his speeches and of his policies. I had been advised on his views. I had been told by other leaders of the West, General de Gaulle, Chancellor Adenauer, Prime Minister Macmillan, what manner of man he was. But I bear the responsibility of the Presidency of the United States, and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me. It is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible, that they are based on as much direct, firsthand knowledge as possible. I therefore thought it was of immense importance that I know Mr. Khrushchev, that I gain as much insight and understanding as I could on his present and future policies. At the same time, I wanted to make certain Mr. Khrushchev knew this country and its policies, that he understood our strength and our determination, and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind. I wanted to present our views to him directly, precisely, realistically, and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification. This was done. No new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side. The gap between us was not, in such a short period, materially reduced, but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully, at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less, and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact. This is important, for neither of us tried to merely please the other, to agree merely to be agreeable, to say what the other wanted to hear. And just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross-examination, instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper, so, too, was this direct give-and-take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital, for the facts of the matter are that the Soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words--war, peace, democracy, and popular will. We have wholly different views of right and wrong, of what is an internal affair and what is aggression, and, above all, we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going. Only by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that Mr. Khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future. Our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood. Neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests. But both of us were there, I think, because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other, that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible, since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine, and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued. We believe in a system of national freedom and independence. He believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism, and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends. However difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests, I think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort. That is why I considered the Vienna talks to be useful. The somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation, nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear. It simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as Americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty. The one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was Laos. Both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation. Both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent Laos, much in the manner of Burma or Cambodia. Of critical importance to the current conference on Laos in Geneva, both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease-fire. It is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at Geneva, enabling the International Control Commission to do its duty, to make certain that a cease-fire is enforced and maintained. I am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at Geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere. No such hope emerged, however with respect to the other deadlocked Geneva conference, seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests. Mr. Khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator--in his opinion because no one was truly neutral; that a Soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement; that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage, in the absence of total disarmament; and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile. In short, our hopes for an end to nuclear tests, for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons, and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow. Nevertheless, the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at Geneva. But our most somber talks were on the subject of Germany and Berlin. I made it clear to Mr. Khrushchev that the security of Western Europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to West Berlin, that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance, and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk, and thus meet our obligation to the people of West Berlin, and their right to choose their own future. Mr. Khrushchev, in turn, presented his views in detail, and his presentation will be the subject of further communications. But we are not seeking to change the present situation. A binding German peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with Germany, and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of West Berlin. Generally, Mr. Khrushchev did not talk in terms of war. He believes the world will move his way without resort to force. He spoke of his nation's achievements in space. He stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production, to out-trade us, to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours. Most of all, he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries. He was certain that the tide there was moving his way, that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a Communist revolution, and that the so-called wars of liberation, supported by the Kremlin, would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion. In the 1940's and early fifties, the great danger was from Communist armies marching across free borders, which we saw in Korea. Our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas.

Barack Obama,United States of America,2015-08-05,"I apologize for the slight delay. Even Presidents have problems with toner.
It is a great honor to be back at American University, which has prepared generations of young people for service in public life. I want to thankPresident Kerwin and the American University family for hosting us here today. 
Fifty-two years ago, President Kennedy, at the height of the Cold War,addressed this same university on the subject of peace. The Berlin Wall had just been built. The Soviet Union had tested the most powerful weapons ever developed. China was on the verge of acquiring a nuclear bomb. Less than 20 years after the end of World War II, the prospect of nuclear war was all too real. With all of the threats that we face today, it’s hard to appreciate how much more dangerous the world was at that time. 
In light of these mounting threats, a number of strategists here in the United States argued that we had to take military action against the Soviets, to hasten what they saw as inevitable confrontation. But the young President offered a different vision. Strength, in his view, included powerful armed forces and a willingness to stand up for our values around the world. But he rejected the prevailing attitude among some foreign policy circles that equated security with a perpetual war footing. Instead, he promised strong, principled American leadership on behalf of what he called a “practical” and “attainable peace” -- a peace “based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions -- on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements.”
Such wisdom would help guide our ship of state through some of the most perilous moments in human history. With Kennedy at the helm,the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved peacefully. Under Democratic and Republican Presidents, new agreements were forged -- aNon-Proliferation Treaty that prohibited nations from acquiring nuclear weapons, while allowing them to access peaceful nuclear energy; theSALT andSTART Treaties which bound the United States and Soviet Union to cooperation on arms control. Not every conflict was averted, but the world avoided nuclear catastrophe, and we created the time and the space to win the Cold War without firing a shot at the Soviets.
The agreement now reached between the international community and the Islamic Republic of Iran builds on this tradition of strong, principled diplomacy. After two years of negotiations, we have achieved a detailed arrangement that permanently prohibits Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. It cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb. It contains the most comprehensive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program. As was true in previous treaties, it does not resolve all problems; it certainly doesn’t resolve all our problems with Iran. It does not ensure a warming between our two countries. But it achieves one of our most critical security objectives. As such, it is a very good deal.
Today, I want to speak to you about this deal, and the most consequential foreign policy debate that our country has had since the invasion of Iraq, as Congress decides whether to support this historic diplomatic breakthrough, or instead blocks it over the objection of the vast majority of the world. Between now and the congressional vote in September, you’re going to hear a lot of arguments against this deal, backed by tens of millions of dollars in advertising. And if the rhetoric in these ads, and the accompanying commentary, sounds familiar, it should -- for many of the same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran nuclear deal.
Now, when I ran for President eight years ago as a candidate who hadopposed the decision to go to war in Iraq, I said that America didn’t just have to end that war -- we had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place. It was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy; a mindset that put a premium on unilateral U.S. action over the painstaking work of building international consensus; a mindset that exaggerated threats beyond what the intelligence supported. Leaders did not level with the American people about the costs of war, insisting that we could easily impose our will on a part of the world with a profoundly different culture and history. And, of course, those calling for war labeled themselves strong and decisive, while dismissing those who disagreed as weak -- even appeasers of a malevolent adversary.
More than a decade later, we still live with the consequences of the decision to invade Iraq. Our troops achieved every mission they were given. But thousands of lives were lost, tens of thousands wounded. That doesn’t count the lives lost among Iraqis. Nearly a trillion dollars was spent. Today, Iraq remains gripped by sectarian conflict, and the emergence of al Qaeda in Iraq has now evolved into ISIL. And ironically, the single greatest beneficiary in the region of that war was the Islamic Republic of Iran, which saw its strategic position strengthened by theremoval of its long-standing enemy, Saddam Hussein.
I raise this recent history because now more than ever we need clear thinking in our foreign policy. And I raise this history because it bears directly on how we respond to the Iranian nuclear program. 
That program has been around for decades, dating back to the Shah’s efforts -- with U.S. support -- in the 1960s and ‘70s to develop nuclear power. The theocracy that overthrew the Shah accelerated the program after theIran-Iraq War in the 1980s, a war in which Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to brutal effect, and Iran’s nuclear program advanced steadily through the 1990s, despite unilateral U.S. sanctions. When the Bush Administration took office, Iran had no centrifuges -- the machines necessary to produce material for a bomb -- that were spinning to enrich uranium. But despite repeated warnings from the United States government, by the time I took office, Iran had installed several thousand centrifuges, and showed no inclination to slow -- much less halt -- its program. 
Among U.S. policymakers, there’s never been disagreement on the danger posed by an Iranian nuclear bomb. Democrats and Republicans alike have recognized that it would spark an arms race in the world’s most unstable region, and turn every crisis into a potential nuclear showdown. It would embolden terrorist groups, like Hezbollah, and pose an unacceptable risk to Israel, which Iranian leaders have repeatedly threatened to destroy. More broadly, it could unravel the global commitment to non-proliferation that the world has done so much to defend.
The question, then, is not whether to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but how. Even before taking office,I made clear that Iran would not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon on my watch, and it’s been my policy throughout my presidency to keep all options -- including possible military options -- on the table to achieve that objective. But I have also made clear my preference for a peaceful, diplomatic resolution of the issue -- not just because of the costs of war, but also because a negotiated agreement offered a more effective, verifiable and durable resolution. 
And so, in 2009, we let the Iranians know that a diplomatic path was available. Iran failed to take that path, and our intelligence community exposed the existence of a covert nuclear facility at Fordow.
Now, some have argued that Iran’s intransigence showed the futility of negotiations. In fact, it was our very willingness to negotiate that helped America rally the world to our cause, and secured international participation in an unprecedented framework of commercial and financial sanctions. Keep in mind unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran had been in place for decades, but had failed to pressure Iran to the negotiating table. What made our new approach more effective was our ability to draw upon new U.N. Security Council resolutions, combining strong enforcement with voluntary agreements from nations like China and India, Japan and South Korea to reduce their purchases of Iranian oil, as well as the imposition by our European allies of a total oil embargo.
Winning this global buy-in was not easy -- I know. I was there. In some cases, our partners lost billions of dollars in trade because of their decision to cooperate. But we were able to convince them that absent a diplomatic resolution, the result could be war, with major disruptions to the global economy, and even greater instability in the Middle East. In other words, it was diplomacy -- hard, painstaking diplomacy -- not saber-rattling, not tough talk that ratcheted up the pressure on Iran. 
With the world now unified beside us, Iran’s economy contracted severely, and remains about 20 percent smaller today than it would have otherwise been. No doubt this hardship played a role inIran’s 2013 elections, when the Iranian people elected a new government that promised to improve the economy through engagement with the world. A window had cracked open. Iran came back to the nuclear talks. And after a series of negotiations, Iran agreed with the international community to an interim deal -- a deal that rolled back Iran’s stockpile of near 20 percent enriched uranium, and froze the progress of its program so that the P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the European Union -- could negotiate a comprehensive deal without the fear that Iran might be stalling for time.
Now, let me pause here just to remind everybody thatwhen the interim deal was announced, critics -- the same critics we’re hearing from now -- called it “a historic mistake.” They insisted Iran would ignore its obligations. They warned that sanctions would unravel. They warned that Iran would receive a windfall to support terrorism.
The critics were wrong. The progress of Iran’s nuclear program was halted for the first time in a decade. Its stockpile of dangerous materials was reduced. The deployment of its advanced centrifuges was stopped. Inspections did increase. There was no flood of money into Iran, and the architecture of the international sanctions remained in place. In fact, the interim deal worked so well that the same people who criticized it so fiercely now cite it as an excuse not to support the broader accord. Think about that. What was once proclaimed as a historic mistake is now held up as a success and a reason to not sign the comprehensive deal. So keep that in mind when you assess the credibility of the arguments being made against diplomacy today.
Despite the criticism, we moved ahead to negotiate a more lasting, comprehensive deal. Our diplomats, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, kept our coalition united. Our nuclear experts --including one of the best in the world, Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz -- worked tirelessly on the technical details. In July, we reached a comprehensive plan of action that meets our objectives. Under its terms, Iran is never allowed to build a nuclear weapon. And while Iran, like any party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is allowed to access peaceful nuclear energy, the agreement strictly defines the manner in which its nuclear program can proceed, ensuring that all pathways to a bomb are cut off. 
Iran will also not be able to acquire the enriched uranium that could be used for a bomb. As soon as this deal is implemented, Iran will remove two-thirds of its centrifuges. For the next decade, Iran will not enrich uranium with its more advanced centrifuges. Iran will not enrich uranium at the previously undisclosedFordow facility, which is buried deep underground, for at least 15 years. Iran will get rid of 98 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium, which is currently enough for up to 10 nuclear bombs, for the next 15 years. Even after those 15 years have passed, Iran will never have the right to use a peaceful program as cover to pursue a weapon.
And finally, Iran has powerful incentives to keep its commitments. Before getting sanctions relief, Iran has to take significant, concrete steps like removing centrifuges and getting rid of its stockpile. If Iran violates the agreement over the next decade, all of the sanctions can snap back into place. We won’t need the support of other members of the U.N. Security Council; America can trigger snapback on our own. On the other hand, if Iran abides by the deal and its economy begins to reintegrate with the world, the incentive to avoid snapback will only grow.
So this deal is not just the best choice among alternatives -– this is the strongest non-proliferation agreement ever negotiated. And because this is such a strong deal, every nation in the world that has commented publicly, with the exception of the Israeli government1, has expressed support. TheUnited Nations Security Council has unanimously supported it. The majority of arms control and non-proliferation experts support it. Over 100 former ambassadors -- who served under Republican and Democratic Presidents -- support it. I’ve had to make a lot of tough calls as President, but whether or not this deal is good for American security is not one of those calls. It’s not even close. 
Unfortunately, we’re living through a time in American politics where every foreign policy decision is viewed through a partisan prism, evaluated by headline-grabbing sound bites. And so before the ink was even dry on this deal -- before Congress even read it -- a majority of Republicans declared their virulent opposition. Lobbyists and pundits were suddenly transformed into arm-chair nuclear scientists, disputing the assessments of experts like Secretary Moniz, challenging his findings, offering multiple -- and sometimes contradictory -- arguments about why Congress should reject this deal. But if you repeat these arguments long enough, they can get some traction. So let me address just a few of the arguments that have been made so far in opposition to this deal.
First, there are those who say the inspections are not strong enough because inspectors can’t go anywhere in Iran at any time with no notice.
On the other hand, without this deal, the scenarios that critics warn about happening in 15 years could happen six months from now. By killing this deal, Congress would not merely pave Iran’s pathway to a bomb, it would accelerate it. 
It is true that if Iran lives up to its commitments, it will gain access to roughly 56 billion dollars of its own money -- revenue frozen overseas by other countries. But the notion that this will be a game-changer, with all this money funneled into Iran’s pernicious activities, misses the reality of Iran’s current situation. Partly because of our sanctions, the Iranian government has over half a trillion dollars in urgent requirements -- from funding pensions and salaries, to paying for crumbling infrastructure. Iran’s leaders have raised the expectations of their people that sanctions relief will improve their lives. Even a repressive regime like Iran’s cannot completely ignore those expectations. And that’s why our best analysts expect the bulk of this revenue to go into spending that improves the economy and benefits the lives of the Iranian people.
Now, this is not to say that sanctions relief will provide no benefit to Iran’s military. Let’s stipulate that some of that money will flow to activities that we object to. We have no illusions about the Iranian government, or the significance of the Revolutionary Guard and the Quds Force. Iran supports terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. It supports proxy groups that threaten our interests and the interests of our allies -- including proxy groups who killed our troops in Iraq. They try to destabilize our Gulf partners. But Iran has been engaged in these activities for decades. They engaged in them before sanctions and while sanctions were in place. In fact, Iran even engaged in these activities in the middle of the Iran-Iraq War -- a war that cost them nearly a million lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. 
The truth is that Iran has always found a way to fund these efforts, and whatever benefit Iran may claim from sanctions relief pales in comparison to the danger it could pose with a nuclear weapon.
Moreover, there’s no scenario where sanctions relief turns Iran into the region’s dominant power. Iran’s defense budget is eight times smaller than the combined budget of our Gulf allies. Their conventional capabilities will never compare with Israel’s, and our commitment to Israel’s qualitative military edge helps guarantee that. Over the last several years, Iran has had to spend billions of dollars to support its only ally in the Arab World -- Bashar al-Assad -- even as he’s lost control of huge chunks of his country. And Hezbollah has suffered significant blows on the same battlefield. And Iran, like the rest of the region, is being forced to respond to the threat of ISIL in Iraq. 
So contrary to the alarmists who claim that Iran is on the brink of taking over the Middle East, or even the world, Iran will remain a regional power with its own set of challenges. The ruling regime is dangerous and it is repressive. We will continue to have sanctions in place on Iran’s support for terrorism and violation of human rights. We will continue to insist upon the release of Americans detained unjustly. We will have a lot of differences with the Iranian regime.
Now, the final criticism -- this sort of a catch-all that you may hear -- is the notion that there’s a better deal to be had. “We should get a better deal” -- that’s repeated over and over again. “It's a bad deal, need a better deal” -- one that relies on vague promises of toughness, and, more recently, the argument that we can apply a broader and indefinite set of sanctions to squeeze the Iranian regime harder.
Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society, or they’re just not being straight with the American people. Sanctions alone are not going to force Iran to completely dismantle all vestiges of its nuclear infrastructure -- even those aspects that are consistent with peaceful programs. That oftentimes is what the critics are calling “a better deal.” Neither the Iranian government, or the Iranian opposition, or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty.
Moreover, our closest allies in Europe, or in Asia -- much less China or Russia -- certainly are not going to agree to enforce existing sanctions for another 5, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress. Because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power. And it certainly wasn’t based on a desire for regime change in Iran.
As a result, those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position as some have suggested, Congress’s rejection would almost certainly result in multilateral sanctions unraveling. If, as has also been suggested, we tried to maintain unilateral sanctions, beefen them up, we would be standing alone. We cannot dictate the foreign, economic and energy policies of every major power in the world.
In order to even try to do that, we would have to sanction, for example, some of the world’s largest banks. We’d have to cut off countries like China from the American financial system. And since they happen to be major purchasers of or our debt, such actions could trigger severe disruptions in our own economy and, by the way, raise questions internationally about the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency.
Now, because more sanctions won’t produce the results that the critics want, we have to be honest. Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. Administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option -- another war in the Middle East.
I say this not to be provocative. I am stating a fact. Without this deal, Iran will be in a position -- however tough our rhetoric may be –- to steadily advance its capabilities. Its breakout time, which is already fairly small, could shrink to near zero. Does anyone really doubt that the same voices now raised against this deal will be demanding that whoever is President bomb those nuclear facilities? 
And as someone who does firmly believes that Iran must not get a nuclear weapon, and who has wrestled with this issue since the beginning of my presidency, I can tell you that alternatives to military action will have been exhausted once we reject a hard-won diplomatic solution that the world almost unanimously supports. 
So let’s not mince words. The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy or some form of war -- maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon. And here’s the irony. As I said before, military action would be far less effective than this deal in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That’s not just my supposition. Every estimate, including those from Israeli analysts, suggest military action would only set back Iran’s program by a few years at best, which is a fraction of the limitations imposed by this deal. It would likely guarantee that inspectors are kicked out of Iran. It is probable that it would drive Iran’s program deeper underground. It would certainly destroy the international unity that we’ve spent so many years building.
Now, there are some opponents -- I have to give them credit; there are opponents of this deal who accept the choice of war. In fact, they argue that surgical strikes against Iran’s facilities will be quick and painless. But if we’ve learned anything from the last decade, it’s that wars in general and wars in the Middle East in particular are anything but simple. The only certainty in war is human suffering, uncertain costs, unintended consequences. We can also be sure that the Americans who bear the heaviest burden are the less than 1 percent of us, the outstanding men and women who serve in uniform, and not those of us who send them to war.
As Commander-in-Chief, I have not shied from using force when necessary. I have ordered tens of thousands of young Americans into combat. I have sat by their bedside sometimes when they come home. I’ve ordered military action in seven countries. There are times when force is necessary, and if Iran does not abide by this deal, it’s possible that we don’t have an alternative.
But how can we in good conscience justify war before we’ve tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives; that has been agreed to by Iran; that is supported by the rest of the world; and that preserves our options if the deal falls short? How could we justify that to our troops? How could we justify that to the world or to future generations?
In the end, that should be a lesson that we’ve learned from over a decade of war. On the front end, ask tough questions. Subject our own assumptions to evidence and analysis. Resist the conventional wisdom and the drumbeat of war. Worry less about being labeled weak; worry more about getting it right. 
I recognize that resorting to force may be tempting in the face of the rhetoric and behavior that emanates from parts of Iran. It is offensive. It is incendiary. We do take it seriously. But superpowers should not act impulsively in response to taunts, or even provocations that can be addressed short of war. Just because Iranian hardliners chant “Death to America” does not mean that that’s what all Iranians believe.
In fact, it’s those hardliners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It’s those hardliners chanting “Death to America” who have been most opposed to the deal. They’re making common cause with the Republican caucus.
The majority of the Iranian people have powerful incentives to urge their government to move in a different, less provocative direction -- incentives that are strengthened by this deal. We should offer them that chance. We should give them that opportunity. It’s not guaranteed to succeed. But if they take it, that would be good for Iran, it would be good for the United States. It would be good for a region that has known too much conflict. It would be good for the world.
And if Iran does not move in that direction, if Iran violates this deal, we will have ample ability to respond. The agreements pursued by Kennedy and Reagan with the Soviet Union, those agreements, those treaties involved America accepting significant constraints on our arsenal. As such, they were riskier. This agreement involves no such constraints. The defense budget of the United States is more than 600 billion dollars. To repeat, Iran’s is about 15 billion dollars. Our military remains the ultimate backstop to any security agreement that we make. I have stated that Iran will never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. I have done what is necessary to make sure our military options are real. And I have no doubt that any President who follows me will take the same position.
So let me sum up here. When we carefully examine the arguments against this deal, none of them stand up to scrutiny. That may be why the rhetoric on the other side is so strident. I suppose some of it can be ascribed to knee-jerk partisanship that has become all too familiar; rhetoric that renders every decision that’s made a disaster, a surrender -- “you're aiding terrorists; you're endangering freedom.” 
On the other hand, I do think it’s important to acknowledge another, more understandable motivation behind the opposition to this deal, or at least skepticism to this deal, and that is a sincere affinity for our friend and ally, Israel -- an affinity that, as someone who has been a stalwart friend to Israel throughout my career, I deeply share.
When the Israeli government is opposed to something, people in the United States take notice. And they should. No one can blame Israelis for having a deep skepticism about any dealings with a government like Iran’s -- which includes leaders who have denied the Holocaust, embrace an ideology of anti-Semitism, facilitate the flow of rockets that are arrayed on Israel’s borders, are pointed at Tel Aviv. In such a dangerous neighborhood, Israel has to be vigilant, and it rightly insists that it cannot depend on any other country -- even its great friend the United States -- for its own security. So we have to take seriously concerns in Israel. 
But the fact is, partly due to American military and intelligence assistance, which my Administration has provided at unprecedented levels, Israel can defend itself against any conventional danger -- whether from Iran directly or from its proxies. On the other hand, a nuclear-armed Iran changes that equation. 
And that’s why this deal ultimately must be judged by what it achieves on the central goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This deal does exactly that. I say this as someone who has done more than any other President to strengthen Israel’s security. And I have made clear to the Israeli government that we are prepared to discuss how we can deepen that cooperation even further. Already we’ve held talks with Israel on concluding another 10-year plan for U.S. security assistance to Israel. We can enhance support for areas like missile defense, information sharing, interdiction -- all to help meet Israel’s pressing security needs, and to provide a hedge against any additional activities that Iran may engage in as a consequence of sanctions relief.
But I have also listened to the Israeli security establishment, which warned of the danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iran for decades. In fact, they helped develop many of the ideas that ultimately led to this deal. 
I recognize that Prime Minister Netanyahu disagrees -- disagrees strongly. I do not doubt his sincerity. But I believe he is wrong. I believe the facts support this deal. I believe they are in America’s interest and Israel’s interest. And as President of the United States, it would be an abrogation of my constitutional duty to act against my best judgment simply because it causes temporary friction with a dear friend and ally. I do not believe that would be the right thing to do for the United States. I do not believe it would be the right thing to do for Israel.
I know it’s easy to play on people’s fears, to magnify threats, to compare any attempt at diplomacy to Munich. But none of these arguments hold up. They didn’t back in 2002 and 2003; they shouldn’t now. The same mindset, in many cases offered by the same people who seem to have no compunction with being repeatedly wrong, led to a war that did more to strengthen Iran, more to isolate the United States than anything we have done in the decades before or since. It’s a mindset out of step with the traditions of American foreign policy, where we exhaust diplomacy before war, and debate matters of war and peace in the cold light of truth.
“Peace is not the absence of conflict,” President Reagan once said. It is “the ability to cope with conflict by peaceful means.”
President Kennedy warned Americans, “not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than the exchange of threats.”
It is time to apply such wisdom. The deal before us doesn’t bet on Iran changing, it doesn’t require trust; it verifies and requires Iran to forsake a nuclear weapon, just as we struck agreements with the Soviet Union at a time when they were threatening our allies, arming proxies against us, proclaiming their commitment to destroy our way of life, and had nuclear weapons pointed at all of our major cities -- a genuine existential threat.
We live in a complicated world -- a world in which the forces unleashed by human innovation are creating opportunities for our children that were unimaginable for most of human history. It is also a world of persistent threats, a world in which mass violence and cruelty is all too common, and human innovation risks the destruction of all that we hold dear. In this world, the United States of America remains the most powerful nation on Earth, and I believe that we will remain such for decades to come. But we are one nation among many. 
And what separates us from the empires of old, what has made us exceptional, is not the mere fact of our military might. Since World War II, the deadliest war in human history, we have used our power to try to bind nations together in a system of international law. We have led an evolution of those human institutions President Kennedy spoke about -- to prevent the spread of deadly weapons, to uphold peace and security, and promote human progress. 
We now have the opportunity to build on that progress. We built a coalition and held it together through sanctions and negotiations, and now we have before us a solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, without resorting to war. As Americans, we should be proud of this achievement. And as members of Congress reflect on their pending decision, I urge them to set aside political concerns, shut out the noise, consider the stakes involved with the vote that you will cast. 
John F. Kennedy cautioned here, more than 50 years ago, at this university, that “the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war.”
But it’s so very important. It is surely the pursuit of peace that is most needed in this world so full of strife. 
My fellow Americans, contact your representatives in Congress. Remind them of who we are. Remind them of what is best in us and what we stand for, so that we can leave behind a world that is more secure and more peaceful for our children.
Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-07-10,"Well, it's going to be an interesting time in the UK, and it's certainly going to be an interesting time with NATO. NATO has not treated us fairly, but I think we'll work something out. We pay far too much and they pay far too little. But we will work it out, and all countries will be happy. With the UK, that's a situation that's been going on for a long time.
So I have NATO, I have the UK, which is in somewhat turmoil, and I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of them all. Who would think? Who would think? But the UK certainly has a -- they have a lot of things going on.
I have not. No, I have not. But Boris Johnson is a friend of mine. He's been very, very nice to me and very supportive. And maybe we'll speak to him when I get over there. I like Boris Johnson. I've always liked him.
Well, that's up to the people. I get along with her very well. I have a very good relationship. That's certainly up to the people, not up to me.
Well, we do have a lot of allies, but we cannot be taken advantage of. We're being taken advantage of by the European Union. We lost $151 billion last year on trade. And on top of that, we spend at least 70 percent for NATO. And, frankly, it helps them a lot more than it helps us. So we'll see what happens. We have a long, beautiful week.
I will say also, last night was an incredible evening. Brett Kavanaugh has gotten rave reviews -- rave reviews -- actually, from both sides. And I think it's going to be a beautiful thing to watch over the next month. But he has gotten rave reviews.
I really can't say right now. As far as I'm concerned, a competitor. A competitor. I think that getting along with Russia, getting along with China, getting along with others is a good thing, not a bad thing. I've said that many times for many years. So we'll see. We're meeting with Vladimir Putin on Monday. We'll see how that goes.
They didn't give it. I have it for him. They didn't give it. But it will be given at a certain period. I actually do -- I actually do have a little gift for him, but you'll find out what that gift is when I give it.
No, I haven't. I really haven't. We haven't discussed it.
Well, I have a solution: Tell people not to come to our country illegally. That's the solution. Don't come to our country illegally. Come like other people do; come legally.
I'm saying this, very simply: We have laws. We have borders. Don't come to our country illegally. It's not a good thing. And as far as ICE is concerned, the people that are fighting ICE, it's a disgrace. These people go into harm's way. There is nobody under greater danger than the people from ICE. What they do to MS-13 and everything else.
So we ought to support ICE, not do what the Democrats are doing. Democrats want open borders, and they don't mind crime. We want no crime, and we want borders where borders mean something. And remember this: Without borders, you do not have a country.  Thank you, everybody.

Nicola Sturgeon,United Kingdom,2020-05-07,"Good afternoon. Thank you very for joining us again today.
I want to start with the usual statistical update on COVID-19 in Scotland.
As at 9 o’clock this morning, there have been 12,924 positive cases confirmed – which is an increase of 215 since yesterday.
A total of 1,587 patients are currently in hospital with either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 – that is a decrease of 45 since yesterday.
A total of 86 people last night were in intensive care with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. And that is a decrease of three since yesterday.
I am also able to confirm today that since 5 March, 2,954 patients who had tested positive and been admitted to hospital for the virus have been able to leave hospital, and I wish all of them well.
Unfortunately though I also have to report that in the last 24 hours, 59 deaths have been registered of patients who had been confirmed through a test as having the virus – and that takes the total number of deaths in Scotland, under that measurement, to 1,762.
As always, let me stress that these numbers are not statistics – or just statistics. They represent real people whose loss is being felt and mourned by many. And I want again to send my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one to this virus – we are all thinking of you.
I also want to thank again our health and care workers for the extraordinary work that you are doing in these most difficult of circumstances.
And I want to thank all of you watching at home, for the sacrifices you are continuing to make as you follow our very clear advice to stay at home, save lives and help us to continue to protect the NHS.
Now I have one main point that I want to update you on this afternoon.
As I have indicated previously this week, the Scottish Government is legally required to review the regulations giving effect to the lockdown every three weeks, and the latest review falls due today.
Our assessment of the evidence leads me to the conclusion that the lockdown must be extended at this stage. More detail of our analysis will be published alongside today’s daily statistics at 2pm. But let me say this now.
We are – together – making really significant progress in our efforts to get this virus under control. I have reported today a further reduction in the number of patients in intensive care. And yesterday, National Records of Scotland reported the first weekly decline in the number of registered deaths related to the virus since this outbreak began.
All of that gives us real hope and real encouragement.
But we also know that progress remains fragile. Our estimates suggest that there are still significant numbers of people in Scotland infected with this virus.
And we are not yet confident that the all-important R number is comfortably below 1 – and I’ve explained and set out before why it is so important to get it and keep it comfortably below 1. Indeed, we think it could still be hovering around 1 just now – which means that any significant easing up of restrictions at this stage would be very very risky indeed.
Also, we think the R number may still be a bit higher here than it is in other parts of the UK – perhaps reflecting the fact that our first cases came later than England’s and so we may be at a different – and slightly later – stage of the infection curve.
Now, all of that tells me that extreme caution is required, at this critical juncture, to avoid a rapid resurgence of the virus.
Before we can judge that it is safe to begin any significant, albeit gradual, easing of the restrictions, we want to see data in the days ahead that confirms a very clear downward trend.
In particular, I want to see what our estimates of new cases and the R number look like a week from now.
And I will be looking very carefully, as I’m sure all of us will be, to see if next week’s NRS figures show a continued fall in the number of deaths.
And it is to allow for such further careful assessment that we have concluded that the lockdown – and the associated regulations – must remain in place for now.
The legal deadline for the next review of these regulations will be three weeks from now – which is the 28 May.
But I want to be very clear again today that we can make changes to the regulations before then if the evidence suggests it is safe to do so.
And let me say again, I am as anxious as anyone to restore some degree of normality to our lives as soon as possible and to reduce the harms that we know lockdown itself is doing.
It is also open to us to amend the supporting guidance if we think that is possible – and indeed there is one very limited, specific change to the guidance that we are considering already, and I want to come back to that shortly.
But, first of all, I want to address reports that you might have seen in today’s media that the Prime Minister might be planning on Sunday to announce changes to the lockdown in England. I should stress that these are only media reports – I do not know yet how accurate they are.
And before I go any further here, I want to take the opportunity to remind you that none of the decisions I am taking just now – absolutely none of them – are driven by politics. They are driven only by doing what is right to tackle this virus and to save lives. And I believe that is true for all leaders across the UK.
However, I have to be clear with you that the potential changes that are reported in the media today have not yet been discussed with the Scottish Government or, as far as I know, with the other devolved governments.
I hope we will have discussions in the next few days. We had expected a COBRA meeting today or tomorrow but it seems now that it might not take place until Sunday – which of course is the day the Prime Minister is due to make his statement.
However, in the last half hour I understand that the Prime Minister has requested a call with the devolved governments later today, and I very much welcome that.
And if and when those discussions do take place I will make very clear – as I have all along – that it is my preference, if possible, for all four UK nations to make changes, together, at the same pace. Because that certainly helps us give clear, consistent messages to you, the public.
However, for that approach to work, we must agree to make changes only when all four governments are satisfied that they don’t risk a resurgence of the virus.
And – again, let me be clear – if the Prime Minister decides that he wants to move at a faster pace for England than I consider is right for Scotland – that is of course his right. I will respect that and I will not criticise him for doing that.
But I hope you understand, and indeed I hope you agree, that I must make judgments, informed by the evidence, that are right and safe for Scotland.
I will not be pressured into lifting restrictions prematurely, before I am as certain as I can be that we will not be risking a resurgence of infection rates.
Now, of the changes that are floated in the media today, there is only one I may – and I would stress at this stage, may – be prepared to agree to in the immediate future – and that is a change to the guidance limiting outdoor exercise to once a day only.
That is currently, as you know, one of the limited number of reasons that you are permitted to leave home.
As I alluded to earlier in the week, we are already considering whether it would be possible now, without increasing the R number, to permit you to exercise outdoors more often than once a day – but on the strict conditions that you still stay within your own household group, stay two meters away from others, and stay reasonably close to your own home.
It would – and let me stress this point – it would not change the overall message to stay at home except for the limited reasons of exercise, food and medicine.
We will report back on our consideration and indeed any four nation discussion of that over the next few days. In the meantime however, let me be clear that the once a day rule does remain in place.
The other possible changes that are reported in the media today – such as encouraging more people back to work now or opening beer gardens or encouraging more use of public transport – would not, in my judgement, be safe for us to make yet.
And I particularly strongly believe that for us to drop the clear, well understood ‘Stay at Home’ message right now could be a potentially catastrophic mistake.
Now, there’s discussion in many countries about the timing of lockdowns.
All along we have taken the decisions we considered right and at the time we thought right. And that’s what we will continue to do. And of course, none of us have the benefit of hindsight when we make those decisions.
But right now we do have the benefit of foresight. And what I do not want a few weeks from now is for us to see a resurgence of this virus and for you to be asking me this – why on earth did you start to ease lockdown a week, or a couple of weeks, too early?
It’s not an exaggeration to say that the decisions we take now are a matter of life and death. And that is why they weigh so very, very heavily. And it’s why they must be taken with great care. And it is why, as I take them, I will continue to err on the side of caution.
Now I will keep you updated of any and all discussions with the UK governments – other UK governments – over the weekend.
For now though, the advice remains the same as it has been.
It is easier for us to start emerging from lockdown, the lower the R number is, and the fewer infectious cases that there are.
And so for all of us, the way in which we emerge from lockdown that bit more quickly, is to stick with the current restrictions now.
So please, stay at home except for essential purposes such as exercise, or buying food or medicines.
Stay more than two meters from other people when you are out, and do not meet up with people from other households.
Wear a face covering if you are in a shop or on public transport. And isolate completely if you or someone else in your household has symptoms.
I know that these restrictions are very tough – and I also know and worry that any talk of easing the lockdown might make it more tempting to go out that bit more often.
But please, resist that temptation. Stick with the current rules. We must – absolutely must – protect the progress that we have all made together so far. Because it is by doing that that we will continue to slow down the spread of the virus, continue to protect the NHS, and continue to save lives.
Thank you very much indeed for listening. I’m going to hand briefly to the Cabinet Secretary for Health before her, I, and of course the Chief Medical Officer take questions from journalists.
",2020 Statement on the Coronavirus (07/05/2020),http://www.ukpol.co.uk/nicola-sturgeon-2020-statement-on-the-coronavirus-07-05-2020/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-05-22,"Thank you very much. We appreciate you being here. I'm delighted to welcome five of our nation's great governors to the White House, and Governor Hutchinson, Governor Ducey, Governor Bryan, Governor Martinez and Governor McMaster, they're doing a fantastic job, and we'll be talking about numerous things.
But one of the elements so important to us is to discuss the border and border security, crime and other things. But that's what we'll be focusing on tonight. We're grateful also to be joined by Secretary Nielsen, who's really working very hard at the border, with some very bad laws.
We have laws that are the worst anywhere in the world, as far as stopping people from coming in. But with that being said, we're down over 40% border crossings. We've been able to do what I think nobody else has been able to do. We're down over 40% tonight, where I'll be discussing joint efforts to stop illegal immigration and secure the borders.
Also we're going to be discussing the deadly ravages of drugs, gangs, and crime that's pouring across our border. We are stopping it and getting them out when they are able to get through, and the only reason they do get through is because of our weak laws that really have been given to us by weak people in Congress.
The Democrats have been horrible on border security. Frankly, it shouldn't be allowed, and many of them are standing there and sitting there and agreeing with me 100%.
As you know, I recently deployed the National Guard to the southern border, and I want to thank each of the governors here tonight. They've all been extremely helpful. They've sent a lot of people to those borders and we appreciate it very much.
We're also working with Congress to close the crippling loopholes and federal or especially, to disgraceful practice of catch and release. That's where you'll catch somebody, talk to him, sign them, and then you have to release them, and it's a horrible situation.
They're supposed to then show up to court. A very small percentage show up to court, and what happens is they get lost in our country, and in some cases, these are not people that you want in the country. So we're talking about catch and release. We have to end it. We're working with Congress on that. These laws have been there a long time and they are horrible
At the same time, we'll use every relevant legal authority to immediately protect our national security and to dismantle the violent criminal organizations plaguing our nation and poisoning our children. What's happening with drugs is a disgrace.
We've started the wall. We have $1.6 billion for the wall. We started new sections and we've started fixing large sections of wall. We have areas in San Diego that are going up very rapidly. We could have waited, and we would have had tremendous support to build the wall because they wanted it very badly in San Diego.
We decided to go forward, instead, we've made a lot of progress on the wall, but now we're going for additional funding and we need the wall for protection of our country also for keeping the drugs out. Very effective. Probably the most effective thing.
So with that, I think maybe what I'll do is we'll go around the room and each of the governors can say a few words, talk about the border, talk about crime or any other subject you'd like. Mr. Governor.
Good, well, you've done a great job Doug. We appreciate it very much, and appreciate your support. You've had it all the way.
General, would you like to say a few words about borders? You know more about borders, I think, than anybody.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much Henry. That's very nice. We are. The country is doing well from the standpoint of economics and finance. And what we're doing, I think, is unparalleled, and I appreciate your statement. Thank you very much. Governor?
Thank you very much Governor. Appreciate it. How about Rick Perry. You know a lot about borders Rick. Governor of Texas for a long time. And what do you think?
A lot of progress. A lot of progress. We do need changes in the law, right Secretary?
We need changes in the law to make it really, really good, but we have done a heck of a job, considering the fact that we do -- and I say it all the time, we have the worst immigration laws in the entire world. There is nobody close, and it could be changed so easily and we're gonna get it changed. Susanna?
Right. Beautifully stated. Thank you very much, appreciate it.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.

And, really, I want to congratulate the Prime Minister on a tremendous victory. He had a fantastic victory, as you know. He didn't surprise me, but he surprised a lot of other people.
See, I knew him, so I said, ""He's going to do very well."" And he did. He did. They called it an upset, but I don't call it an upset. You probably didn't. Your wife didn't call it an upset. It's a fantastic thing you did.
That's exactly right.
I'll tell you what: I'd like to.
It might not be easy, but I'd like to. That's a big deal. That's going to be great. That's going to be great.
Yeah, well, I think I can say very easily that we've been very good to our allies. We work with our allies. We take care of our allies. Generally speaking, I've inherited massive trade deficits with our allies. And we even help our allies militarily. So we do look at ourselves, and we look at ourselves, I think, more positively than ever before.
But we also look at our allies. And I think Australia is a good example. We've worked together very closely - - just recently, on a big trade situation. We had a little bit of a trade deal going, and it worked out very well for both of us. And I think especially when it comes to those great allies, and Australia would be right there.
We're very proud of it. It's one of our oldest and one of our best. We were just talking about the battles that we fought together. These are big-name battles, and they were tough battles, and we won every one of them. So, it's great to be with you.

John Hutton,United Kingdom,2015-12-02,"Can I first of all thank the CBI for inviting me to come and talk with you this morning.
I very much welcome the commitment of the CBI to engage in the debate about public service reform.  For many years business organisations in the UK were not always fully involved in the debate about how we improve the quality of our public services.  That has now changed.  Businesses use and fund public services.  Education, transport and health systems make a critical difference to the competitiveness of the UK economy. And increasingly you are part of the solution – partnering with the public sector in the delivery of those services.  The creation of the CBI’s Public Services Strategy Board and this Public Services Forum reflects the tremendous growth of this new industry and a commitment on behalf of business in engaging fully in that debate. We welcome this involvement and participation.
This is probably the right time for us to reflect on what we have learnt from a decade in office – what has worked and what hasn’t worked – and for us to debate where the focus of public service reform needs to shift to meet the challenges of the coming decade.
There is no doubt in my mind that a continuing commitment to reforming our public services will be central to the Government’s agenda.  The reason for this is obvious.  Globalisation and demographic change necessitate an appropriate response from our public services so that we can help individuals and families realise the opportunities of the new world economy.  Without such a response, our society and our economy would be impoverished – the life chances of millions diminished.
I know there are some on the political margins who hope the coming political transition inside the Labour Party will open a window of opportunity to reverse our approach.  They will be disappointed.  The core of our reform programme – significant and sustained investment, choice, personalisation and empowerment for users, devolution to the front line, an open minded approach to who provides – is being built into the DNA of our public service infrastructure.
There is little doubt that this Government’s progress on public service reform can be described as a journey.  It is tempting for all of us when we look back to try and retrofit a neat story about our public service reforms.  In reality, whether in the public or private sector, you have to learn on the job. And themes do emerge over time.
There are four that stand out.
First, that investment in our public services – in people, technology, infrastructure – has been a necessary pre-condition for reform.  But on its own it is insufficient.  Many in my party wanted to believe that we would deliver service improvement simply by building more schools and hospitals and recruiting more staff.  Ten years on we recognise the incredible benefits that that investment has brought – I see it all the time in my own constituency and across the country – but we also recognise its limits. Money can not solve all of the problems we face.
Second, timelines are frustratingly long.  If ministers decide that something fundamental needs to change in the system today, in reality it often takes several years before the effects of that change start to flow through.  Then more time before it has widespread impact.  And for that reason alone, we should perhaps have started more of our reforms from Day 1.
Third, that part of the political and intellectual journey we have been on, is to realise that the development of social markets hold the key to reform.  This has been perhaps the most controversial and difficult of our reforms.  Opening up monopoly state provision to private and voluntary sector providers.  In the early days we believed that structural change was a distraction from raising educational standards or healthcare.  Eventually we came to understand that structural change and incentives also have an important role to play in raising standards; that you simply could not have one without the other.
And finally, it is clear that there are limits to central intervention, planning, targets, audit and inspection.  Self-sustaining reform – a built-in mechanism to drive continuous quality improvement – can only be achieved if individual users of public services become the drivers of performance in the system and local staff and institutions are empowered to respond to and help deliver those preferences.
And it is on this last point – about how we create a wider ownership for reform that I want to focus my remarks today.
It has become a familiar critique that despite substantial investment, recruitment of hundreds of thousands more staff and above average wage increases, that those who have to deliver public services feel insufficient ownership or responsibility for the reforms being implemented.
So, one of our most difficult tasks in this next phase of reform is how to share power, responsibility and accountability with staff and institutions to create a new momentum behind these reforms, one that is less reliant on central direction but balanced by new accountabilities to customers and an intolerance of failure.
You know only too well from the way you manage your own businesses, that there is ultimately a limit to how much you can achieve through imposing targets and practice on staff.  If those that work within your organisations do not believe in what you are saying and feel disconnected from the process of change, then change – real and sustained – simply won’t happen.
Forging a new relationship with staff will be important.  5.5 million people are now employed in the public sector.  They are a conduit for informing and shaping the national public debate about our public services.
There are those that think the root of this problem lies with too much top down central control and the imposition of targets that distort customer priorities.
There are those that think we have placed too much emphasis on structural change and reorganisation for its own sake.
There are those that think the so-called marketisation of our public services has eroded a public service ethos.
There are those that think the cause lies with our tone, our communication strategy or ‘narrative’.  If only we explained more clearly what we were trying to do, then ‘they would get it’.
And there are those that think it will always be like this and that we just need to accept that they will never be ‘on our side’.  Change disrupts comfortable patterns and established ways of doing things.
As ever, there’s no simple answer.  No straightforward solution.  I’m sure that there is more we need to do to engage effectively with staff.  Communicate where we are going and why.
But for me, what this challenge really reflects is a more fundamental question. ‘Who owns the responsibility for reform in our public services today?’
I don’t just mean the day to day implementation of today’s priorities but tomorrow’s innovation in patient care, welfare or teaching standards?
Because we believed strongly in the case for change, we drove it hard from the centre.  We ‘owned’ the challenge of change.  Both the problem and the answer.  We came to believe that policy makers and politicians in Westminster and Whitehall were meant to be the brain for every creative impulse across the system.  It delivered improvements and continues to do so.  But it comes with a price.  A stream of initiatives, targets and legislation in which staff often feel passive recipients; in which they have little influence or control.
But analyse any of the UK’s best performing companies and you will find few that are able to maintain high customer service standards, innovation and efficiency without creating that shared sense of ownership deep within the organisation that can ensure continued success.
So, if our challenge is to create a shared sense of ownership amongst both staff and customers for the future of public service reform, how we create it is equally critical.
And I am clear that it won’t be achieved by slowing down the pace of reform.  It won’t be achieved just through engaging more effectively with staff or communicating our message.
It will only be achieved through sharing the responsibility and accountability for change.  For as long as reform is seen simply as a dialogue between the national media and politicians, we will continue to detach local institutions and the people who work within them from owning the change that should be made.
That shared sense of ownership can only come if we at the centre are clearer about our national priorities and frame them increasingly in ways that reflect the outcomes that we want to achieve.
If we want to move to a system based on a shared sense of ownership then we will need to empower not only the customer but also the staff to bring about the changes they feel are necessary to respond to customer needs.
The mistake we must avoid is sharing power and responsibility without accountability.  That will never work.  Government can only step back if there’s a strong, responsive framework of accountability for individuals and organisations that fall short.
When we nationalised public services in the post-war era, it was based on a deal with public service professionals that said, ‘we will nationalise this service but we will give you the freedom to get on and manage’.  But there was a flaw. No one took responsibility for service failure. We had come to expect that public services would never be as good as those that could be paid for by people who could afford to opt out.
In 1997 many people within the public sector believed that we would go back to that post-war settlement – except this time with increased investment.
We did of course significantly increase investment.  But we also broke with the post-war past by creating new forms of accountability.  We set national targets and oversaw their delivery through one of the most expansive audit and inspection regimes in the world.  However necessary this shift, it prioritised accountability to the centre.  It underplayed the role of the consumer in shaping public services.  Or the importance of public preferences and choices in driving performance.  As such it meant the ‘ownership’ for change was ‘grabbed’ by the centre and left there.  And as the pace of reform intensified and more fundamental change advanced, the dynamic between employees and the political leadership of the country felt critical at best and passive at worst.
So if we share ownership for change, we must base a new settlement of accountability through two routes; firstly to match devolution of power with the use of payment by results funding systems; but secondly and crucially through enhancing, wherever possible and appropriate, the use of competition that allows the customer to influence public services through the choices they make.
If we can get this right, then public service reform will become more self-sustaining; driven not by central Government, but increasingly designed and championed by those operating within the public sector. Performance should no longer need to be managed through an overly engineered web of targets, audit and inspection.  Instead, accountability driven first hand by customers.
At the DWP our City Strategy seeks to capture these principles – offering local consortia of providers new funding and flexibilities in return for outcome-based payments. And David Freud’s report on our welfare system earlier this year, argued for a more effective market in welfare provision, rewarding providers proportionate to the value to the taxpayer of getting an individual into work and helping them to stay there.
With such an approach must come a re-balancing of welfare expenditure towards those who are most in need. A payment by results system – as we have tested out in the Employment Zones – could create incentives to develop programmes across the full spectrum of clients and avoid cherry-picking of the easiest clients to help by paying more to help those furthest from the labour market and facing the greatest barriers to work.   And critically, the centre will be able to step back as the system imbeds itself.
The same is increasingly true for education and health. At the heart of the public service reform programme in the NHS is the development of a more transparent payment by results system that incentivises output based performance. While in education we are developing and piloting models of “Contextual Value Added” – measuring the results of pupils against what might be expected based on previous attainment and factors relating to their background.
The potential power of such information is not just that it strengthens accountability and performance management – but when combined with greater contestability and choice, it can give the user of public services a strong mechanism to shape these services through the choices they make.
We need to put an end to the essentially passive relationship that has all too often characterised the nature of the interaction between the user of public services and the State that provides them.
A relationship that can be particularly damaging for those who need good quality public services the most – where poor outcomes can all too readily become accepted as all that can reasonably be expected.
Exercising choice over a provider or programme can be a powerful way of restoring a real sense of personal responsibility in the individual – enabling them to shape the service outcomes that they themselves want. Of course there are limits to choice – and we must always understand this. But that must not become an excuse for failing to extend the opportunity of choice to those most in need of our public services.
At its most simple, the ability to make an informed choice is still about getting the very basics of a service culture right within the public sector; choice about which channels to use to access services or booking a next-day appointment with a GP online. At its most complex, choice is about a deliberative process of engagement with a school about a child’s education.
Afterall, public services are there to give people a choice. The choice of a good education, good health and the chance to succeed in life – especially for people who could never afford to buy these services themselves.
Critically, over the past decade we have also learnt about the intrinsic benefits of managed competition as a way of strengthening accountability and shifting the ownership of change.  It is that process of competition and how we structure it that creates the dynamic for change – not necessarily whether competing services are delivered by the public, private or voluntary sectors.
I have always believed that strong public services are the best provider of opportunity that any society can have.
But ultimately our values can only be maintained in the decades ahead if we are prepared to continue radical reform. If we are serious about transforming people’s lives by making our public services accountable to the people they serve.
And if, in doing so, we hope to make the best possible use of the energy, expertise and commitment of public service professionals, then we must be prepared to see through the fundamental change we have begun.

1. Begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border, on day one. Mexico will pay for the wall.
2. End catch-and-release. Under a Trump administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.
3. Move criminal aliens out day one, in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement. We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.
4. End sanctuary cities.
5. Immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties. All immigration laws will be enforced - we will triple the number of ICE agents. Anyone who enters the U.S. illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country.
6. Suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.
7. Ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.
8. Ensure that a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system is fully implemented at all land, air, and sea ports.
9. Turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. Many immigrants come to the U.S. illegally in search of jobs, even though federal law prohibits the employment of illegal immigrants.
10. Reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, keeping immigration levels within historic norms.

Arthur Balfour,United Kingdom,2019-01-13,"The history of this House is not a brief or an uneventful one, but I think it has never met in sadder circumstances than to-day or had the melancholy duty laid more clearly upon it of expressing a universal sorrow—a sorrow extending from one end of the Empire to the other, a sorrow which fills every heart and which every citizen feels, not merely as a national, but also as a personal loss. I do not know how it may seem to others, hut, for my own part, I can hardly yet realise the magnitude of the blow which has fallen upon the country—a blow, indeed, sorrowfully expected, but not, on that account, less heavy when it falls.
I suppose that, in all the history of the British Monarchy, there never has been a case in which the feeling of national grief was so deep-seated as it is at present, so universal, so spontaneous. And that grief affects us not merely because we have lost a great personality, but because we feel that the end of a great epoch has come upon us—an epoch the beginning of which stretches beyond the memory, I suppose, of any individual whom I am now addressing, and which embraces within its compass sixty-three years, more important, more crowded with epoch-making change, than almost any other period of like length that could be selected in the history of the world. It is wonderful to reflect that, before these great changes, now familiar and almost vulgarised by constant discussion, were thought of or developed—great industrial inventions, great economic changes, great discoveries in science which are now in all men’s mouths-—Queen Victoria reigned over this Empire.
Yet, Sir, it is not this reflection, striking though it be, which now moves us most deeply. It is not simply the length of the reign, it is not simply the magnitude of the events with which that reign is filled, which have produced the deep and abiding emotion which stirs every heart throughout this kingdom. The reign of Queen Victoria is no mere chronological landmark. It is no mere convenient division of time, useful to the historian or the chronicler. No, Sir, we feel as we do feel for our great loss because we intimately associate the personality of Queen Victoria with the great succession of events which have filled her reign, with the growth, moral and material, of the Empire over which she ruled. And, in so doing, surely we do well. In my judgement, the importance of the Crown in our Constitution is not a diminishing, but an increasing factor. It increases, and must increase with the development of those free, self-governing communities, those new commonwealths beyond the sea, who are constitutionally linked to us through the person of the Sovereign, the living symbol of Imperial unity. Hut, Sir, it is not given, it cannot, in ordinary course, be given, to a constitutional Monarch to signalise his reign by any great isolated action. His influence, great as it may be, can only be produced by the slow, constant, and cumulative results of a great ideal and a great example; and in presenting effectively that great ideal and that great example to her people Queen Victoria surely was the first of all constitutional Monarchs whom the world has vet seen. Where shall we find any ideal so lofty in itself, so constantly and consistently maintained, through two generations, through more than two generations, of her subjects, through many generations of her Ministers and public men?
Sir, it would be almost impertinent for me were I to attempt to express to the House in words the effect which the character of our late Sovereign produced upon all who were in any degree, however remote, brought in contact with her. In the simple dignity, befitting a Monarch of this realm, she could never fail, because it arose from her inherent sense of the fitness of things. And because it was no artificial ornament of office, because it was natural and inevitable, this queenly dignity only served to throw into a stronger relief, into a brighter light those admirable virtues of the wife, the mother, and the woman with which she was so richly endowed. Those kindly graces, those admirable qualities, have endeared her to every class in the community, and are known to all. Perhaps less known was the life of continuous labour which her position as Queen threw upon her. Short as was the interval between the last trembling signature affixed to a public document and the final and perfect rest, it was yet long enough to clog and hamper the wheels of administration; and when I saw the accumulating mass of untouched documents which awaited the attention of the Sovereign, I marvelled at the unostentatious patience which for sixty-three years, through sorrow, through suffering, in moments of weariness, in moments of despondency, had enabled her to carry on without break or pause her share in the government of this great Empire. For her there was no holiday, to her there was no intermission of toil. Domestic sorrow, domestic sickness, made no difference in her labours, and they were continued from the hour at which she became our Sovereign to within a few days—I had almost said a few hours—of her death. It is easy to chronicle the growth of Empire, the course of discovery, the progress of trade, the triumphs of war, all the events that make history interesting or exciting; but who is there that will dare to weigh in the balance the effect which such an example, continued over sixty-three years, has produced on the highest life of her people?
It was a great life, and surely it had a, happy ending. She found her reward in the undying affection and the passionate devotion of all her subjects, where so ever their lot might be cast. This has not always been the fate of her ancestors. It has not been the fate of some of the greatest among them. It has been their less happy destiny to outlive contemporary fame, to see their people’s love grow cold, to find new generations growing up who know them not, and burdens to be lifted too heavy for their aged arms. Their sun, once so bright, has set amid darkening clouds and the muttering of threatening-tempests. Such was not the lot of Queen Victoria. She passed away with her children and her children’s children, to the third generation, around her, beloved and cherished of all. She passed away without, I well believe, a single enemy in the world—for even those who loved not England loved her; and she, passed away not only knowing that she was—I had almost said adored by her people, but that their feelings towards her had grown in depth and intensity with every year in which she was spared to rule over them. No such reign, no such ending, can the history of this country show us.
Mr. Speaker, the Message from the King which you have read from the Chair calls forth, according to the immemorial usage of this House, a double response. We condole with His Majesty upon the irreparable loss which he and the country have sustained. We congratulate him upon his accession to the ancient dignities of his House. I suppose at this moment there is no sadder heart in this kingdom than that of its Sovereign; and it may seem therefore to savour of bitter irony that we should offer him on such a melancholy occasion the congratulations of his people. Yet, Sir, it is not so. Each generation must bear its own burdens; and in the course of nature it is right that the burden of Monarchy should fall upon the heir to the Throne. He is, therefore, to be congratulated, as every man is to be congratulated who, in obedience to plain duty, takes upon himself the weight of great responsibilities, filled with the earnest hope of worthily fulfilling his task to the end, or, in his own words, “while life shall last.” It. is for us on this occasion, so momentous in the history of the Monarchy, so momentous in the history of the King, to express to him our unfailing confidence that the great interests committed to his charge are safe in his keeping, to assure him of the ungrudging-support which his loyal subjects are ever prepared to give, him, to wish him honour, to wish him long life, to wish him the greatest of all blessings, the blessing of reigning over a happy and a contented people, and to wish, above all, that his reign may, in the eyes of an envious posterity, fitly compare with that great epoch which has just drawn to a close. Mr. Speaker, I now beg to read the, Address which I shall ask you to put from the Chair and to which I shall ask the House to assent. I move—
“That a humble Address be presented to His Majesty, to assure His Majesty that this House deeply sympathises in the great sorrow which His Majesty has sustained by the death of our beloved Sovereign, the late Queen, whose unfailing devotion to the duties of Her high estate and to the welfare of Her people will ever cause Her reign to be remembered with reverence and affection: to submit to His Majesty our respectful congratulations on His Accession to the Throne, to assure His Majesty of our loyal attachment to His person, and further to assure Him of our earnest conviction that His reign will be distinguished under the blessing of Providence by an anxious desire to maintain the Laws of the Kingdom, and to promote the happiness and liberty of His subjects.”

We have a sacred duty to remember the twisted thinking that led here -- how a great society of culture and science succumbed to the worst instincts of man and rationalized mass murder and one of the most barbaric acts in history.
The perpetrators of that crime tried to annihilate the entire Jewish people.But they failed. Because 65 years ago today, when the gates flew open, you were still standing.And every day that you have lived, every child and grandchild that your families have brought into the world with love, every day the sun rises on the Jewish state of Israel -- that is the ultimate rebuke to the ignorance and hatred of this place.
Let that be the true meaning of Auschwitz. Let that be the liberation we celebrate today -- a liberation of the spirit that, if embraced, can lead us all -- individuals and as nations -- to be among the righteous.

Charles Morrison,United Kingdom,2020-04-16,"I feel that the sands of time have run out even before I start, so I shall endeavour to be brief. I agreed strongly with the hon. Members should be able to live adequately. I might add “by roughly equivalent standards”, but I emphasise “roughly” because I also agree with him that we are unique and I do not think that our salary scale should be attached to any other scale. That must mean a review by the Boyle committee or its equivalent not just once in a while, at the behest of the Government, but at regular intervals. This is an objective towards which we should be working.
I was glad that the hon.
However highly motivated the potential parliamentarian aged 28 or 30 may be, since it is not unusual for young people of that age to have been married only recently, he may well have to consider carefully his responsibility towards his wife and family. In addition, when wives consider the alternatives of the parliamentary salary or their husbands continuing in their present careers and gradually climbing the ladder, most will tell their husbands that in no circumstances should they go into the House of Commons. That is an important aspect for us to take into account.
There was a germ of truth in some of the comments of the right hon. He said that we should make our decision on behalf of subsequent Parliaments and not for ourselves. I disagree; I believe that we should make the decision, implement it, and go to the country carrying that responsibility on our own shoulders, rather than half-pretending that only others will benefit from our decision. I would prefer to come clean with the electors to putting up a smoke-screen and pretending that something that is to happen will not happen.
I agree strongly with those who said that it is never the right time to review parliamentary salaries. For almost as long as I can remember, there have been the additional problems involved with incomes policies, but the real and relative values of parliamentary salaries have been steadily eroded. If it pleases the right hon. Member for Down, South, I add the words “while I have been an hon. Member.”
The fact that salaries are too low is entirely the fault of ourselves, particularly the Back Benchers. Our salaries are not imposed on us by the Treasury; they are imposed on us because we have not been prepared to take a strong line ourselves. In the past, there has been a lot of lobbying by us all, particularly Back Benchers, about salary increases, but when the Government of the day decide to make increases or to implement someone else’s recommendations, we Back Benchers have too often run scared. We have run for cover and let the Government carry ​ the can. In consequence, we have got what we deserve—or, perhaps, what we do not deserve.
Looking to the future, it is important that, to a much greater extent, we should personalise the responsibility on each of us for justifying the salaries that we receive. This is a subsidiary objective in the development of the joint approach between both main parties for which the greatest credit must be given to my right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes).
The Minister referred to future pay increases and said that there were grave difficulties in giving a blind commitment in advance. I understand that. It is not surprising that there should be that reaction from the Government Front Bench, in isolation. It is not impossible for the commitment, which has been requested by other hon. Members, to be made by both Front Benches and, if need be, by the minor parties. If such a commitment is not made there will be continuing and growing dissatisfaction because of the uncertainty that will arise.
Unless some such commitment is entered into there will be an unseemly row, such as there has been in other countries, for example, Australia. The outcome of that sort of row will be that the Back Benches will be in control and will impose their will on the Government of the day and, perhaps, the Opposition Front Bench. The Government have to remember that they are the servants of Parliament, not vice versa.

Nicky Morgan,United Kingdom,2016-01-14,"What a pleasure it is to be here with the Holocaust Educational Trust again.
I had the pleasure, too, of speaking at HET’s summer reception last year and my colleague Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary, spoke at HET’s annual dinner in the autumn.
British politicians – on all sides – take the work of HET very seriously because we believe that what happened during the Holocaust must never be forgotten.
I was thrilled to see that 10 Holocaust survivors were recognised in this year’s New Year’s Honours list and that 3 of them, Agnes, Renee and Susan, are here with us this evening.
Let me also say how honoured we all are to have Eva Clarke here.
I won’t say too much about her story because you will hear more about it during the conversation coming up but let me pay a brief tribute to her.
Eva was born at the gates of a concentration camp in 1945 in the final days of World War 2.
Her mother, Anka, suffered not just at one concentration camp but several.
Eva was truly a miracle baby, and she is a survivor who is keeping the memories of what happened during the Holocaust alive by going into schools – on a totally voluntary basis – and educating the next generation.
To Eva and to all the survivors among us tonight – you are truly inspirational. Thank you for sharing your stories over and over again to ensure that future generations never forget what you – and millions of others endured.
I am pleased that the Department for Education funds HET’s Lessons from Auschwitz project, which has sent more than 28,000 students to visit the site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.
I visited Auschwitz in 2012 with a group of young people from a school in my constituency.
Talk to anyone who has been and they will all tell you the same thing: once you have visited Auschwitz it never leaves you.
I can’t stress enough just how important it is that every generation of young people not only knows what happened at Auschwitz – and other concentration camps – but also understands the horror of what happened so that their generation can be steadfast in preventing it ever happening again.
This is particularly pressing as the torch passes from survivors to the next generation to tell the story of the Holocaust.
Those young people who visit Auschwitz become ambassadors for the Holocaust Education Trust.
By taking the time to discuss it not only with their peers but also their wider communities they are at the front line of the battle against intolerance.
I know that some of HET’s ambassadors are here tonight so please join me in thanking them for their work and giving them a round of applause.
There is no room for complacency on Holocaust education and HET have rightly highlighted their concerns.
These have focussed on gaps in knowledge, specialist teaching and how teaching about the Holocaust is prioritised.
For our part, we recognise the vital importance of maintaining Holocaust education as a key part of the key stage 3 curriculum and we will continue to do all we can to promote, support and fund teaching of the Holocaust.
As many of you will already know, Holocaust Memorial Day will be marked on 27 January – the day of Auschwitz’s liberation.
Its theme this year is ‘Don’t stand by’, and we are prompted to remember those people who refused to stand by and watch as the horror of the Holocaust unfolded around them.
People like Jane Haining, a Scottish missionary in a Jewish orphanage in Hungary who refused to evacuate but chose instead to stay with the children.
Jane was later killed in a gas chamber.
People like Frank Foley, Head of the British Passport Control Office in Berlin who used his position to forge passports and grant visas for those who would have found themselves inside concentration camps. Frank saved many thousands of lives.
To the Members of the House of Commons and House of Lords here tonight please be aware that HET are placing a ‘book of commitment’ in each House – as they do every year – and I would encourage every member to sign it; to publicly affirm their commitment to remembering the Holocaust as well as take part in debates taking place in both Houses in the lead up to Holocaust Memorial Day itself.
I’d also like to pay tribute to the work of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation and everything they are doing to take forward the recommendations of the Prime Minister’s Holocaust Commission to build a proper national memorial to the Holocaust and to record the testimony of British Holocaust survivors and camp liberators before it is too late.
I know the Prime Minister will have more to say on this later this month.
As a nation it is vitally important that we remember the Holocaust, to remember those who suffered as well as those who refused to stand by as the suffering occurred.
As a nation Britain is not prone to inaction but that doesn’t mean we don’t have a responsibility to keep what happened fresh in our minds.
We must remember collectively so that not a single one of us can ever forget.
The Holocaust didn’t begin in the gas chambers. It began in the minds of a hateful, ignorant, dangerous few.
That’s why my department has been so active in leading the fight against extremism in education and attempts to radicalise young people.
Now more than ever we feel the threat of those who want to put poison in the minds and hatred in the hearts of our children and we must help them develop the resilience to resist their propaganda.
Learning about the Holocaust helps to do just that – not just informing young people’s history but helping them to understand the dangers of prejudice, bigotry and intolerance and in doing so making them more tolerant, more confident and more resilient as citizens too.
Let’s make sure that in Britain we continue to educate everyone about the Holocaust so that the evil it represents can never be allowed to flourish again.
Thank you.

Greg Clark,United Kingdom,2016-01-26,"I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak alongside Lord Adonis and Lord Heseltine, who have done so much to galvanise the debate on the future of our cities.
It’s also an honour to share a stage with Mike Ward and Sir Peter, each of whom brings so much passion and intelligence to working for the future of their respective cities.
All I want to do today is answer a simple question. It is to explain why, in the Coalition Agreement, the Government made a commitment to establishing elected mayors in cities outside London, subject to a confirmatory referendum of local people.
Let me start with an example that will be familiar to everyone here. Nearly one hundred and forty years ago, Joseph Chamberlain became mayor of Birmingham. At the age of 37, he was not what would now be called a career politician. He had spent his early life running family businesses – trading in ironware and shoes. But his business acumen equipped him well for civic life. After just three years as mayor, he was able to boast that he had left his city “parked, paved, assized, marketed, gas and watered and improved.”
His influence is still evident today, from parks that soften the city, to fine buildings on Corporation Street, to the University. But his legacy is more than physical: he has become a symbol of what good local government can achieve, and an abiding inspiration to generations of people who believe in public service in their city.
It is no coincidence, I would argue, that Chamberlain represented a particular brand of leadership. He was a charismatic individual who assumed the captaincy of his city, exercised broad powers, and set a clear personal vision.
Today, the great challenge before us is one of economic growth. And I am convinced that the battle for Britain’s prosperity will be won or lost in our cities. It is a challenge on a global scale. Consider Birmingham, the second largest city economy in the United Kingdom, but only now the 71st largest in the world. A world, in which economic power is shifting from West to East and North to South. Where, when it comes to competing for the brightest graduates and the best investment, you don’t just have to beat Barcelona, but Bangalore too.
Our cities have great strengths and a proud history, but they need to fight harder than ever to be heard in world that is dawning. Vigorous local leadership is becoming more important as every year goes by.
It is self evident that each of our cities is distinct and unique. Bristol and Newcastle, Manchester and Leicester, they all have different ambitions, different assets. No team of ministers or officials in London – no matter how bright or well-intentioned – can devise one set of solutions that fit these very different circumstances. To achieve their ambitions, to fulfil their potential, cities need to take charge of their own destinies. The drive must come from within, not without.
To achieve their ambitions, to fulfil their potential, cities need to take charge of their own destinies.
Where we can see strong leadership, complemented by clear accountability to local people, we in central Government are ready to help cities do things their way. Our great cities should not be run as branch offices of central Government. This may turn the established order on its head, but it’s time that Whitehall knew its place. Let Birmingham be Birmingham, let Manchester be Manchester. Let cities have the powers and freedoms they need tailored to their individual circumstances. I am, for example, looking forward to talking with Sir Peter about the new freedoms he needs to help him shape Leicester’s future.
Local leadership can come in many forms. Look at Mike’s past eight years as leader here – producing ambitious plans for the city centre, securing improvements to New Street Station, and getting the new library underway. Or take Mike’s key role in making a success of the new Local Enterprise Partnership, for example by securing the involvement of Andy Street – the MD of John Lewis – one of Britain’s most outstanding business leaders in one of Britain’s most admired companies. Mike’s achievements stand as testament that great things are possible under current arrangements.
But I believe the evidence also shows that some forms of leadership are better suited than others in helping cities reach their full potential. The experience, both in this country and abroad, suggests that the leadership model with the greatest promise of all is the elected mayor.
Research undertaken on behalf of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2005 found that the democratic mandate provided by directly elected mayors has – and I quote “provided a basis for a stronger, more proactive style of leadership than other models.”
The world’s great cities have mayors who lead for their city on the national and international stage, attracting investment and jobs.
Look at the cities that Birmingham is twinned with: Chicago, Frankfurt, Johannesburg, Lyon and Milan. All led by an executive mayor.
We believe that mayors can help English cities achieve their full potential too.
In its twelve years of existence, the Mayoralty of London is already hailed across the world for its influence in raising the profile of the capital and for securing major projects the city needs – from Crossrail to the Olympic games.
Mayors have clout – a personal mandate to speak truth to central Government, to argue for the interests of those they represent.
Mayors are visible – with a profile that makes them natural ambassadors for their cities, especially when it comes to attracting investment.
And with a four-year term, mayors have the space to think for the long term, to make tough strategic decisions, to get public and private sectors working together effectively.
In short, I believe that mayors have the greatest potential of any leadership model, which is why we are asking our largest cities to vote on whether they want to move to a mayoral system.
To those who worry that our proposals represent an imposition on communities – I would say that, on the contrary, referendums give people a chance to look at the evidence and decide for themselves. All we are doing is insisting on the debate – and giving the people of each city the chance to have their say.
Last Thursday, Parliament considered the order that would allow the people of Birmingham can have their say on the 3rd May. Subject to further parliamentary debates, we soon hope to confirm that ten more cities will be having a referendum in May too. If cities vote yes to having a mayor, a further ballot will take place to decide who that first mayor should be.
The new mayor should be in place sooner rather than later to get on with the job. So I can announce today that our intention is that this ballot will take place on November 15: the same day as the elections for the first police commissioners – and hence a day that I hope will be a landmark in the shift of powers and influence from Whitehall to communities.
2012 will be a mayoral year in Britain. We will see a contest that will decide who will be leader of our capital city in this, its Olympic summer. We will see mayoral referendums in 11 of our great cities. Where cities want it, we will see further votes in November. There is every prospect that by the end of this year a new generation of mayors will be in post.
Now it’s over to you. This May, the people of our cities will have the chance to have their say. Now is the time to start weighing up what a mayor can do for your city, and so I welcome today’s debate as just such an opportunity.
Thank you to the Chamber of Commerce for hosting this occasion. Birmingham has made a rich contribution to the history of municipal leadership. I can’t think of a better place to witness a debate that is key to its future.

Sajid Javid,United Kingdom,2018-03-23,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement to update the House on support for those affected by the Grenfell tragedy and on the second report from the independent recovery taskforce. This report will be published in full on gov.uk and placed in the Library of the House.
Nine months on, the shocking and terrible events of 14 June continue to cast a long shadow. I know that it cannot have been easy for the survivors and the bereaved to hear last week about the failure of a fire door from the tower, which was tested as part of the Metropolitan Police Service’s investigation. I am confident that the police and the public inquiry will, in time, provide answers. But, having met survivors and heard their stories, I know that that does not take away from the pain and loss being suffered now by those left behind. Their welfare remains our highest priority, and we see that through our continued work supporting the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and through the valuable work of my right hon. We are ensuring that the voices and concerns are heard right across Government. That work is supported by my Department and, more widely, by the NHS, by local government and by the voluntary sector.
I give my thanks to everyone who has gone that extra mile to be there for a community that has gone through so much. I also thank the taskforce for its work in helping us to ensure that, after the slow and confused initial response to the disaster, the people of North Kensington are receiving better support from RBKC to help them to recover and to rebuild their lives.
I was clear when I reflected on the taskforce’s first report in November that, while progress was being made, I expected to see swift, effective action to address all the issues that were highlighted, particularly the slow pace of delivery and the need for greater empathy and emotional intelligence—two things that are vital if RBKC is to regain the trust of the people that it serves.
My Department has been working closely with RBKC throughout to provide the support and challenge necessary to drive this work. I am pleased to see, from the taskforce’s second report, that some important progress has been made. RBKC, alongside the Government, has put in significant resources and increased its efforts to provide those affected with greater clarity about the support that is available to them. We have also seen a stronger focus on implementing new ways of working to drive much needed cultural change across the council in collaboration with external stakeholders, and a greater candour about the improvements that still need to be made. But there is much more to do to ensure that residents can see and feel that things are getting better on the ground. Nowhere is this more important than the vital task of rehousing those who lost their homes—a task that I have always been clear must be sensitive to individual needs, but not use these needs as an excuse to justify any type of delay.
Five months on from the fire, at the time of the taskforce’s first report, 122 households out of a total of 204 had accepted an offer of temporary or permanent ​accommodation. Only 73 households had moved in, and only 26 of those had moved into permanent homes. Today I can report that 188 households have accepted an offer of accommodation. Just over two thirds of these—128 households—have already moved into new accommodation, including 62 into permanent homes. This is welcome news but, as the taskforce’s second report highlights, progress has been far too slow.
It was always going to be a challenge to respond to an unprecedented tragedy on this scale and to secure new accommodation in one of the country’s most expensive locations, but progress has not been made as quickly as it should have been. There are still 82 households in emergency accommodation, including 15 in serviced apartments, with 25 families and 39 children among them. This is totally unacceptable. The suffering that these families have already endured is unimaginable. Living for this long in hotels can only make the process of grieving and recovery even harder. As the taskforce has said, it is unlikely that all households will be permanently rehoused by the one-year anniversary of the fire. This is clearly not good enough. I hoped to have seen much more progress. It is very understandable that the people of North Kensington will feel disappointed and let down, even if there are encouraging signs that the pace of rehousing is speeding up.
The council now has over 300 properties that are available to those who lost their homes, so each household can now choose a good quality property that meets their needs, with the option of staying in the area if that is what they wish. To ensure that these homes are taken up, I expect all households, regardless of their level of engagement, to be given whatever support they require to be rehoused as quickly as possible. The Government will continue to play their part, providing help with rehousing and other support for survivors, including financial support currently worth more than £72 million. The weeks ahead will be critical for ensuring that efforts to rehouse survivors go up a gear. I will be closely monitoring progress and will of course keep the House updated.
As I said earlier, if the council is to regain trust it is paramount that the Grenfell community is not just being told that things are changing, but can see that its views and concerns are being heard and acted on. A good example of this, as highlighted by the report, is the transfer of responsibilities from the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation to RBKC on an interim basis. This happened after residents made it clear that the tenant management organisation could no longer have a role, not only on the Lancaster West estate but more widely in housing management throughout the borough.
Residents have been engaged in the process of refurbishing the Lancaster West estate, with the Government matching the £15 million that the council is investing in this programme. Alongside this, the council will shortly be consulting residents on the long-term delivery of housing management needs across the borough. The voices and needs of the residents will also be at the heart of the process to determine the future of the Grenfell site and the public inquiry, which has just begun its second procedural hearing.
There must be an even stronger focus on needs as we step up efforts not just to rehouse survivors, but to help them to rebuild their lives and, vitally, to rebuild trust. ​It is a process that will clearly take time and unstinting commitment on all sides. As the taskforce has noted, some progress has been made, but there is no room for complacency. I expect the council to take on board the taskforce’s recommendations and do more to listen to the community, improve links with the voluntary sector and act on feedback that it gets from those on the frontline.
I thank the members of the taskforce once again for their valuable contribution, which will continue for as long as it is needed. As they have noted, despite the many challenges, there is
“a level of community spirit and attachment not often seen in local communities in London”.
It is a dynamic and diverse community spirit made stronger during the darkest of days—a spirit that is determined to secure a brighter future for the people of North Kensington. We share that determination and will continue to work with the bereaved, survivors and others. I commend this statement to the House.
",2018 Update on the Grenfell Tragedy,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/sajid-javid-2018-update-on-the-grenfell-tragedy/
Jo Johnson,United Kingdom,2018-02-14,"Good morning.
It’s a pleasure to be here today.
And where better to discuss the knowledge economy than the British Museum?
A place ‘full of unassailable facts’, according to Trollope.
And a fitting backdrop for this Knowledge Quarter conference.
Since this kind invitation was extended, I have moved from being Universities and Science Minister to being a Minister in the Department of Transport and Minister for London
And the invitation followed me.
In fact, it was clear to me that even as I entered the world of bus lanes, cycle-superhighways and high-speed trains, there was no leaving the knowledge economy.
Our hard infrastructure of roads, railways and airports and our soft infrastructure, in the form of our human capital and the institutions that cultivate it, are of course intimately connected and mutually dependent.
And one of the reasons for the Knowledge Quarter’s success as a cluster is certainly its hyperconnectedness, so obvious in its extraordinary transport links.
St Pancras, gateway to continental Europe, now restored to its Victorian splendour.
King’s Cross Station, transformed in recent years and now catering for 50 million passengers a year.
Euston about to be transformed by HS2, with faster connections to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.
Multiple bus routes.
Six different underground lines, as well as the Elizabeth Line and, eventually, Crossrail 2.
The Knowledge Quarter is networked – a quality that’s vital for the transmission of knowledge into practical applications in our economy.
Transport and travel have always been fundamental to the development and diffusion of knowledge.
We can see that in the collection that surrounds us at the British Museum today….
With its countless stories of exploration, adventure and discovery.
And it’s that relationship – between transport and knowledge – that I’d like to discuss today.
During the 19th century, Britain developed from an agricultural economy to an industrial one.
But today, our economic performance is increasingly dependent on our human capital.
Skills, creativity and innovation are more likely to provide a competitive advantage than access to mass labour or natural resources.
At the same time, the relationship between the state, business and citizens is changing.
It was Sir Francis Bacon who said ‘Scientia potestas est’ – knowledge is power.
Today, we all have unprecedented access to information and knowledge.
Tweets and videos go round the world in an afternoon – and sometimes old ones come back to bite too.
Higher education, once rationed to a narrow elite, is now a mass undertaking.
Whereas only 19% of young people went to university in 1990, the proportion is now close to 46% – and this includes more people from disadvantaged backgrounds than ever before.
Technology and political devolution are combining to rebalance power away from the centre – and towards the region, the community, and the individual.
This might sound like a threat to some.
But it’s actually an opportunity.
It’s an opportunity that’s at the heart of the government’s Industrial Strategy.
In our support for hard and soft infrastructure – from HS2 to broadband to our universities and our world-leading science base.
In our creation of elected mayors and devolved authorities.
Building and supporting the knowledge economy across the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine – areas that were global leaders when the industrial economy was thriving, and that are now diversifying into new sectors.
We want the rest of the country to be as hyperconnected as you are here in London’s Knowledge Quarter.
The new industries taking hold in these regions depend increasingly on innovation and specialist knowledge.
Sustainable energy and cyber security in Northern Ireland.
Manchester’s media sector and science parks.
Digital hubs in Leeds and Newcastle.
And fast-growing creative industries in Wales.
But although new knowledge clusters depend on modern skills and innovation, something about them never changes.
Their reliance on good transport links and communications.
The Knowledge Quarter is itself actually part of a much bigger geographical network – sometimes known as the Golden Triangle – linking Oxford, Cambridge and London.
And containing one of the world’s great science and innovation hubs.
Even within this extraordinary Golden Triangle, there is scope for better connectivity.
Which is why we’re reviving the rail line between Oxford and Cambridge.
This route survived the Beeching cuts of the early 1960s, but was torn up a few years later by British Rail.
The closure of the line was one of the most regrettable acts of transport vandalism of the era.
Today, the corridor from Oxford to Cambridge is one of the fastest-growing areas of the country.
It contains not only brilliant universities, but also a great concentration of science and technology employers.
But transport connections between Cambridge, Milton Keynes and Oxford are so poor they create a barrier between hubs of knowledge-based growth.
So we are restoring the old line.
And we aim to have it fully open by 2030.
By reconnecting the two university cities with rail services, and by linking up Milton Keynes, Bedford, Bicester and Bletchley in the Golden Triangle, we aim to create a knowledge corridor that will drive growth and jobs for generations to come.
To develop more of these hubs across the country, we’re carrying out place-based Science and Innovation audits.
To build new consortia and smart regional specialisations.
We also want to deepen connections between knowledge hubs across the UK.
From Scotland to Cornwall to Northern Ireland.
It’s vital we stimulate the knowledge economy by improving transport throughout the country.
That’s why we’re working with Transport for the North on its important plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail.
And it’s why we’re transforming connections between Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands by building HS2, linking 8 of our 10 biggest cities.
The biggest investment in the country’s railways since the Victorian era.
But there’s a clear problem with hypermobility that we must also acknowledge.
We’re travelling twice as much as we did in 1970.
We’re driving more than ever before.
And flying more than ever.
Many thought transport would become less necessary as the Internet grew.
But in fact the opposite has happened.
And while this mobility spurs economic growth, there’s a price to pay.
In congestion.
Overcrowded trains.
Pollution.
And carbon emissions.
In fact there comes a point when too much travel undermines its benefits.
When congestion clogs the network and pollution destroys our planet.
We’re at that tipping point today.
Congestion plagues the Knowledge Quarter and every major city in the country.
The average speed of vehicles in the centre of London is now just 8 mph during the day.
Trollope would recognise these paltry speeds.
That’s a slow trot for a horse. If it carries on declining, we’ll before long reach equine walking pace.
However, occasionally, an opportunity arises to make a breakthrough.
To invest in and roll out technologies that are true game-changers.
Providing completely new solutions to old problems.
And we have one of those opportunities today.
To rethink the way we plan and deliver transport services.
To end our reliance on fossil fuels.
With self-driving vehicles and smart infrastructure.
With digital communications that design transport services around the user.
Our opportunity – if we grasp it – is to make travel easier and more reliable.
To clean up transport emissions.
To diversify our transport industry into new markets, and stimulate knowledge-based growth in our economy.
All while continuing to enjoy the special advantages that good transport connections have always brought.
That’s the challenge.
The pace of innovation in the automotive sector, with driverless vehicles about to change our lives in ways we are only now just grasping, is breathtaking.
So let me instead take rail as my example.
Here there has been less innovation.
Certainly – train services have grown at a remarkable rate since privatisation in the 1990s.
Particularly considering that our railway infrastructure was designed and built for a Victorian economy – not a 21st century one.
As a result we now have one of the most intensively used networks in Europe.
This government is injecting record levels of investment in the railway to help it cope with these pressures and to grow further.
But alongside increased funding, the industry also needs to modernise and to innovate.
Compared with other forms of transportation, progress has been palpably slow.
Yes, we’ve got real-time platform information.
Better train management allowing more services to run on existing tracks.
And big improvements in safety.
But the railways of today are ones that in many respects Trollope would again have no difficulty in recognising.
The pace of innovation needs to find a new gear.
Sometimes, those innovations can be relatively modest.
That’s why in October we launched the ‘First of a Kind’ programme…
With Innovate UK and the Knowledge Transfer Network…
To speed up the delivery of new ideas and improvements to rail services.
Today I can announce that the winning ideas from the programme’s first £3.5 million competition include:
A system to guide passengers to available seats when boarding.
Apps that will improve the travel experience for disabled passengers.
And programmes which will educate and inform long distance passengers about the sights they see from their window.
But other innovations have to be on a much bigger scale.
And that’s why I am today announcing a new ambition.
I would like to see us take all diesel-only trains off the track by 2040.
If that seems like an ambitious goal – it should be and I make no apology for that.
After all, we’re committed to ending sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040.
If we can achieve that, then why can’t the railway aspire to a similar objective?
Rail may be less carbon intensive than road transport.
That’s why modal shift’s so important.
Getting freight and passenger vehicles off the roads onto greener forms of transport.
But that does not absolve the rail industry from cleaning up its own act.
You may have seen stories recently about transport becoming the most polluting sector of our economy.
And the fact that rail emissions have actually increased in absolute terms.
Up 33% since 1990.
This cannot go on.
Now – we are making progress on modernising rolling stock.
For example, the much derided Pacers are going.
Along with other long-standing members of the fleet like Intercity 125s….
Old diesels being replaced by much cleaner trains featuring low carbon and NOx technology.
But we need to go further…
By decarbonising rail, we’ll reduce pollutants and improve air quality, particularly in our semi-enclosed stations.
We will tackle this with the urgency it deserves by setting tough new environmental performance goals in each rail franchise which the train operators will have to meet.
Total electrification of our tracks is unlikely to be the only or most cost-effective way to secure these vital environmental benefits.
New bi-modes trains are a great bridging technology to other low emission futures.
Bi-mode trains fitted with modern diesels – which we started introducing last autumn on the Great Western line and on the East Coast Main Line in 2018 – are less polluting than the trains they replaced.
And as battery technologies improve we expect to see the diesel engines in bi-modes replaced altogether.
With batteries powering the train between the electrified sections of the network.
Or maybe in the future we could see those batteries and diesel engines replaced with hydrogen units?
Alternative-fuel trains powered entirely by hydrogen are a prize on the horizon.
I’d like to see hydrogen train trials on the UK railway as soon as possible.
Hydrogen offers an affordable – and potentially much cleaner – alternative to diesel.
And the technology has developed fast in recent years.
To the extent that Alstom is now testing a train which only emits steam and condensed water – yet is capable of 140 km per hour and a range of up to 800 kilometres.
Which matches the performance of regular regional trains.
Rolls Royce is also looking at this technology
So the next generation of trains is just around the corner.
To speed our journey towards a zero-carbon railway, the government is investing record amounts in public R&amp;D to improve our knowledge base.
Through the environmental performance goals we are setting in each rail franchise, we will hold the train operators to account for progress.
These include reducing energy consumption of trains, depots and many stations.
We have tasked Arriva – the operator of the Northern franchise – to deliver an electric/battery hybrid on the Windermere branch from 2021.
But the drive to decarbonise must come from all sectors of the industry.
So today I am calling on the railway to provide a vision for how it will decarbonise.
And I expect the industry to report back by the autumn.
I want to see a clear, long term strategy with consistent objectives and incentives.
I want to see options like lighter rolling stock and alternative sources of power considered and analysed.
I want barriers to innovation removed, so ideas can be brought to market more rapidly.
And I want to see the railway industry show a lead on this crucial issue.
With train operators, Network Rail, and the companies that supply them – all working together as one team.
So let me finish this speech on a positive note.
Despite the challenges I’ve outlined today, I hope I’ve also communicated my optimism about the prospects for the future of transport in this country.
The organisations here in the Knowledge Quarter have a role to play in developing technologies and know-how that will help Britain to enjoy an even bigger advantage from transport in the future:
Increased mobility for every part of the community – yet less congestion.
More intensive use of the infrastructure – and yet more comfortable travel.
Faster journeys – yet fewer transport emissions. These goals are within our grasp.
A knowledge economy more innovative than ever.
So let’s raise our ambitions – and realise them.
Thank you.

David Cameron,United Kingdom,2015-11-23,"It is wonderful to be back with my good friend and partner David Cameron. I’d like to congratulate him, as I did over the phone, on his resounding election victory and look forward to working with him on a whole host of issues in the coming year.
This is going to give us an opportunity to discuss a number of particular challenges that require US and United Kingdom leadership. We’ll be talking about Russia and Ukraine, and the importance of us maintaining the sanctions regime to put pressure on Russia and separatist forces, to implement fully the Minsk agreement. We think that there can be a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to this problem but it’s going to require that Europe and the United States and the Transatlantic Partnership, as well as the world, stay vigilant and stay focused on the importance of upholding the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty.
We’ll also have a chance to talk about hot spots like Libya and Nigeria where obviously terrorism has gotten a foothold. And more affirmatively, we’re going to have the opportunity to continue the discussion bilaterally that we’ve been having with the other G7 members around issues like trade and climate change and the importance of US and British leadership on those issues.
So I am very much looking forward to this conversation. We have no closer partner around the globe on a whole host of critical issues. I would note that one of the great values of having the United Kingdom in the European Union is its leadership and strength on a whole host of global challenges. And so we very much are looking forward to the United Kingdom staying a part of the European Union because of – we think its influence is positive not just for Europe but also for the world.
Well, thank you very much, and it’s good to be back with my friend and close partner Barack Obama, and working together over the coming years. As you said Barack, there are so many issues to discuss at this meeting and bilaterally, with our very close partnership and the partnership between Britain and the United States, that special relationship. But they all really come down to two words: prosperity and security. What we want for our people back at home, which is the chance of a job and also the chance of greater security. And whether we’re discussing the situation in the Ukraine, the need to fight Islamist extremist terrorism, particularly in Iraq and Syria, but elsewhere around the world, it’s about keeping people safe back at home, where the cooperation between our security and intelligence services and our military is as close as it’s ever been, and as effective as it’s ever been.
We’ve also got a lot of issues to discuss that really will determine whether we can have successful, strong economies, like the need for these trade deals we were talking about earlier, and also the deal on climate change which is going to be very important for our future prosperity and security.
So a lot of issues to discuss tonight and it’s great to be back together with you addressing them in this bilateral meeting as well as in the bigger G7. So thank you very much.
",2015 Statement with President Barack Obama,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2015-statement-with-president-barack-obama/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-07-17,"We're both ready. I've no doubt. We need toughness. We need strength. Obama's weak, Hillary's weak. And part of it is that; a big part of it. We need law and order. We need strong borders.
Well, as a president, I'm going to be -- you know, they've been an ally and I stay with our allies. They have been an ally. But that was a quick coup. I was actually surprised to see how well it was handled. And you know who really handled it? The people.
So, I mean, we can say what we want, but the people handled it. When they surrounded the army tanks -- And without the people, you would've never had it. The military would've taken over.
Horrible.
It is war. By the way, it is war.
Look, we have people that hate us. We have people that want to wipe us out; we're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS. These are people that --
I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need; which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there. We are going to use --
Excuse me -- and we're going to have surrounding states and, very importantly, get NATO involved because we support NATO far more than we should, frankly, because you have a a lot of countries that aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing. And we have to wipe out ISIS.
And speaking of Turkey, Turkey is an ally. Turkey can do it by themselves. But they have to be incentivized. For whatever reason, they're not. So we have no choice.
Very little. I'm going to --
-- get neighboring states and I'm going to get -- we are going to get NATO; we're going to wipe 'em out. We're going to --
Now look, we are going to get rid of ISIS, big league. And we're going to get rid of 'em fast. And we're going to use surrounding states. We're going to use NATO, probably. And we're going to declare war. It is war.
Yeah, you went to Iraq, but that was handled so badly.
I don't care.
It's a long time ago. And he voted that way and they were also misled.
But I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning
Many people have, and frankly, I'm one of the few that was right on Iraq.
But she's not --
No. She's not.
Okay, I did.
That called me and came to me and wanted it badly. And you know, the press didn't report that. The press said, ""Well, maybe he's having hard time picking --""
I actually brought it up to him.
I got to know him during the -- when I was in Indiana during the primaries, and I did very well in Indiana, like I did just about everywhere else in all fairness. And I looked at the numbers, meaning the financials, which we would say in business.
But I looked at the numbers. Unemployment? What a great job he did. Jobs? What a great job he did. Triple-A rating on his bonds.
I broached it
I would say that he thought about it a little bit.
Like many others.
Well, I went for the quality individual rather than I'm going to win a state, because I'm doing very well in Indiana, and I guess I'm a lot up. And I think I'm going to win Indiana. I have a great relationship and Bobby Knight helped me so much with Indiana. Indiana's a great place; great state.
He would've been very good. But -- but I really like him as an individual.
Very happy.
Yes, it was party unity. I'm an outsider. I am a person that used to be establishment when I'd give them hundreds of thousands of dollars.
-- than anybody else. He's very establishment, in many ways, and that's not a bad thing. But I will tell you --
-- I have seen more people that, frankly, did not like me so much, and now they're saying, ""What a great pick."" You see the kind of reaction. He -- he has helped bring the party together. I understand. Look, I got more votes than anybody, but I also understand there's a faction --
I think it's very close to unified. And I will say --
No. I think it's be-- I think it was much more unified than people thought. You saw that with the recent vote where we won in a landslide. You saw that with the big vote, the primary vote.
I think it's far more unified than the press lets on. But having Governor Mike Pence has really -- people that I wasn't necessarily liking or getting along are loving this pick, because they have such respect for him
And the party unity is okay. You know, I think it's okay to say I picked somebody, because I -- as one of the things. But I really believe the main reason I picked him is the incredible job he's done. Just look at the economics of Indiana --
-- and what's going on.
Religious.
Religious --
yeah, religious.
Hey, I won the evangelicals. The evangelicals --
-- well, I think it means a lot. I don't think they think I'm perfect, and they would get up and they would say, ""You know, he's not perfect,"" but --
-- they like me --
-- but I won -- I won states with evangelicals that nobody thought I'd even come close to --
-- and I won --
-- with landslides --
I think it helps. But I don't think I needed him, no, because -- I won with evangelicals.
what might be immediately obvious.
I think we will have very, very good chemistry. I feel that. And I can feel that pretty early on. I don't think you need to be with somebody for two years to find that out. My feeling is --
I knew him during the primaries, during many trips to Indiana, I'd be with him. I think we have a great chemistry.
Yeah.
Lesley, Lesley
We're different people. I understand that. I'll give you an example. Hillary Clinton is a liar. Hillary Clinton -- that was just proven --
-- last week.
Hillary Clinton --
-- you better believe it. Hillary Clinton is a crook.
I call her ""Crooked Hillary."" She's crooked Hillary. He won't -- I -- I don't -- I didn't ask him to do it, but I don't think he should do it because it's different for him.
He's not that kind of a --
-- person. We're different people --
-- to me she's --
-- Crooked Hillary.
I don't think he should use that term. I've never said one way or the other. But to him, I don't think it would sound right, but he will say how dishonest she is by going over the facts.
I'd like him to if he thinks I was doing something wrong --
-- just say --
Absolutely --
-- absolutely. I might not apologize. You know, you said apologize, but --
. I accept that from my consultants and my people and If Mike came in and told me, you know, ""I think you should do this or that —
I would listen and very likely listen to him.
You could say yes. I -- that's okay.
that one, you could say yes, I mean, you're not — it's fine -- hey, look, I like John McCain. But we have to take care of our vets.
Okay, but I'm just --
-- I'm just saying, that's --
-- why not that many people are that upset --
So you call it territories. Okay? We're going to do territories. We're going to not let people come in from Syria that nobody knows who they are. Hillary Clinton wants 550 percent more people to come in than Obama --
-- who doesn't know what he's --
-- so we're going to --
-- no, I -- call it whatever you want. We'll call it territories, okay?
You know -- the Constitution -- there's nothing like it. But it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, as a country, okay? And I'll tell you this. Call it whatever you want, change territories, but there are territories and terror states and terror nations that we're not going to allow the people to come into our country.
And we're going to have a thing called ""Extreme vetting."" And if people want to come in, there's going to be extreme vetting. We're going to have extreme vetting. They're going to come in and we're going to know where they came from and who they are.
Is that a good thing? I think that's a good thing.
Well, I -- I speak from my heart and my brain.
This is maybe more important.
I do. I'm free trade, but I want to make good deals. No, no, I'm all for free --
-- trade. You --
-- know I'm not an isolationist. A lot of people think because I want to make good deals --
-- these are stupid people --
-- wait a minute Lesley, these are stupid people that think that. I want to make great deals for our country. We have deals like the deal signed by Bill Clinton, NAFTA, one of the worst things that ever happened to this country in terms of trade, in terms of economics.
We're going to bring back jobs --
We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our wealth, we're going to take care of our people. Very simple.
I like that answer.
But Lesley, let's step further. We have an enemy, ISIS and others, who chop off heads, who drown people in steel cages and we can't do waterboarding --
-- okay, they're not playing --
-- what, those techniques get information. I don't care what anyone says.
And get information --
-- using those things.
Well, I think we're going to have an exciting time. We've got some wonderful speakers. We have some very talented people. My family's going to speak.
I have great faith in law enforcement. If they don't want to take their guns, I think that's fantastic. But I have great confidence in law enforcement. The police like Donald Trump. It's law and order. And I have great confidence that they will do a great job.
I want to make America great again. Honestly. I want to make Am-- I'm not doing this because -- I'm sacrificing tremendous things. I could be doing other things. It's lovely to sit down with you and be grilled. That's okay. But I could be doing other things right now. And I have some of the greatest properties in the world. I could be out there --
I tell you what. I've really enjoyed this process. I've gotten to know the people of this country. I've gotten to know places that I didn't know, that I read about, but I didn't know. I've also gotten to see the problems. And it's a movement.
Now, when you ask me the question, do I want to be?
I want to be for one reason. I want to make America safe again, and I want to make America great again. That's why I'm doing this. And I love it.
I do want to govern.
I do --
I govern my -- I --
Sure. No, no I want to govern
Okay.
I think I am, actually humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.
You just said it best.
In a world that's spinning apart. That's what I'm thinking of. I'm not thinking of, ""Oh gee, isn't this wonderful? Isn't this great what I've done?"" I've had people that said, ""It doesn't matter if you win or lose, what you've done has never been done before. You're going to go down in the history books.""
You know what I say to 'em?"" I say, ""You're wrong."" I will consider it, 'cause I funded my own primaries, I'm funding now a lot of this campaign. I'm putting in, you know -- I've spent $55 million in the primaries.
I'm spending a fortunate now. I'll tell you, it is spinning. Our world is spinning out of control. Our country's spinning out of control. That's what I think about. And I'll stop that.
I love what he just said.
",Interview: Lesley Stahl Interviews Donald Trump and Mike Pence on 60 Minutes,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-60-minutes-pence-stahl-july-17-2016
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-03-27,"Well, thank you, Sean, very much. It's an honor.
Well, we are very happy about it. It's gone on for a long time, almost since the beginning of my term, and you know, if you look at it, we've done so much despite that. But it was a cloud. It was a cloud that most people didn't believe, fortunately. They spent more than $30 million, hundreds of interviews of people, in some cases very innocent people that were put through the ringer.
Millions of document pages, millions and millions of document pages, and after that, there was no collusion, there was no obstruction. It was such a ridiculous thing that happened. On the other hand, you know, you look at, how did this start? How did it start? You had dirty cops. You had people that are about FBI folks.
I know so many. They are incredible people. But at the top, they were not clean, to put it mildly. And what they did to our country was a terrible, terrible thing.
Well, when I said there could be somebody spying on my campaign, a lot of things happened. It was like -- it went wild out there. They couldn't believe that I could say such a thing. And as it turned out, that was a small potatoes compared to what went on. When you look at what happened, and when it happened, and the money that was spent, the millions and millions on the phony dossier, and then they used the dossier to start things, and there was no truth whatsoever.
It was a fraud and paid for by Hillary Clinton and paid for by the Democrats and the DNC. It's hard to believe. If you wrote this as a novel, no one would buy it. It would be a failure because it will be too unbelievable. Nobody would believe it's possible, the things that went on. And we're getting to the bottom of it, and it's got to be -- I mean, you can never allow this to happen to another president.
This can never, ever happen to a president again, Sean. That was a disgrace and an embarrassment our country, that they were allowed to get away with this. Hopefully, they won't get away with it.
Well, people were hurt so badly, so badly. Their lives have been ruined and over -- you know, over something that should have never taken place, an investigation that should have never happened. There was no crime, as you know. You're only allowed to do this legally if there is a crime. There was no crime.
They've all admitted it. Comey, who is a terrible guy, Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Page, the lover, Page, and all of these people, they've admitted in testimony that there was no crime. So they'd started an investigation based on no crime. I will say this, our new attorney general, Bill Barr, is a great gentleman.
I've heard about him for years. He's a great man. Had he been there initially, this all would not have happened because what has gone on there is just a disgrace to our country.
So, but a lot of -- a lot of innocent people were hurt very badly, and it's very, very sad actually.
Well, I'm going to leave that to our new attorney general, who has been so incredible, actually. That's based on a lot of people saying, this is a very, very special person. That's what you need in that position. That's a very important position. You need so many different -- you need genius, you need rationality, you need different levels of good.
And I'm also going to leave it to Lindsey Graham. He's head of Judiciary and Senate and a very, very good guy and a very smart guy. You know, I'm just going to let them do whatever they want to do, and I would imagine they don't like what they see, to put it mildly. But you would have to ask them. I think it is much more appropriate -- I purposely did not want to involve myself in this whole thing.
I wanted to let other people do it. And I wish he didn't take so long. You know, we are talking about really longer than, if you think about it, longer than Mueller -- it was many months before that that Strzok and Page were talking about the insurance policy, right? The insurance policy -- just in case Hillary Clinton lost, they wanted an insurance policy against me. And what we were playing out until just recently was the insurance policy.
They wanted to do a subversion. It was treason. It was really treason. If the Republican Party had done this to the Democrats, if we had done this to President Obama, you'd have 100 people in jail right now and it would be treason. It would be considered treason and they'd be in jail for the rest of their lives.
But it worked out the other way, and, you know, it just is really a horrible situation. And an incredible outcome, or certainly very close to an outcome, and we'll have to see how it all started. But I'm going to leave that to other people, including the attorney general, and others, to make a determination.
But it's very, very important for our country to know, because in 50 years from now, and 100 years from now, if someone tries the same thing, they have to know that the penalty will be very, very great, if and when they get caught.
Well, as I told you, many, many people were hurt, incredibly hurt by this whole scam, just a scam. But it's much worse than that. It's at the highest level, and the importance is so -- what it meant our country, it's a very, very dark period, and I think maybe we are shedding a lot of light. We are going to come into a bright, beautiful, sunny day.
But when you mention General Flynn, he was a man who had an incredible record in the military, you see what happened to him. The FBI said he wasn't lying, as I understand it, and if the Mueller group said he was lying, and you know what he has gone through, and what so many others have gone through. I could name names that would just go on for the entire -- your entire show.
It's a very, very sad thing. I don't want to talk about pardons now but I can say, it's so sad on so many levels.
As many people have said, and fortunately we have had some incredible people that really were fair. When you mentioned Rush or Mark -- Mark Levin, or Steve Doocy, and Ainsley in the morning, and Brian and Laura, Jesse, Jeanine -- I hope Jeanine's back soon.
So many people. I don't want to keep going because I'm going to leave out some people. I could again go so long. So many great people have been -- you know, they get it. Nobody has been tougher, nobody, on Russia than me. And everybody -- my enemies say that, when they are reasonable enemies, when they are fair.
You look at the pipeline, exposing that going into Germany. You look at oil with the number one -- I mean, it is what we have done with energy, and oil and gas and that is all competition from -- for Russia. You look at the Ukraine, you look at so many different levels. You look at our military. Look at the fact that we would have been powered by wind, which wouldn't have worked, by the way, because it only blows it sometimes, and lots of problems come about.
But we are stronger now as a country then we have ever been. We are doing better financially than we have ever done, our markets are hitting records all the time. I have many, many records of the highest stock market. It's up almost 50 percent from the time I am elected president.
And other countries are way down. You look at China as an example, we are negotiating a deal with China. We're going to make a very good deal with China. China is way down. We are way up. But nobody has been tougher to Russia or on Russia than Donald Trump, President Trump. Nobody even close. And yet, with all of that, we want to have a great relationship with Russia.
We want to have a great relationship with China. All of these things are smart to do. We'll do great with it. But nobody has been tougher. And when I watched all of this nonsense, it was fake news, just terrible fake news, the good news is, based on polls and based on other things, based on where we stand now with the public, Sean, the people never bought it. They get what's happening.
Our country is doing fantastically well. More regulations cut than any other president, and that's only in two years. Nobody's come even close. The big tax cuts, so many things we are going to do, incredible health care that the Democrats, frankly, wouldn't even know how to do. We all become the party of health care, the party of really good health care.
We've done so much and we have so much planned. So when I had to listen to CNN, which is so, so fake, so horribly fake, I would just -- I wouldn't listen often -- believe me, I wouldn't want to listen often. But whenever I did, whenever I thought, I have never seen anything like it. And MSNBC, the same thing.
The good news is, I heard their ratings last night, both of them were -- they dropped off the folder. They dropped to a level that nobody could believe because now that they see the Mueller report, where you look at their finding -- I mean, the finding was very, very strong. No collusion, no obstruction, no Russia, no nothing.
And it's great. I notice your record, you had virtually record ratings last night. So, that's because you have credibility. So I want to think FOX. I want to thank some of those people I just named, but also many others, they have been so fantastic to me, and really to our country. And I really do -- they are really amazing people, great people.
And it wasn't so easy for them.
Well, he's right about that -- for any reason. If you look at Article Two, for any reason. But despite that, that was an incorrect statement. When you say what I said, there was nothing said wrong there but they did not play the whole interview. When they play the whole thing, you see exactly. I mean, the fact is, it would only get worse.
And I said this. It would only get worse if I fired him. I knew that it was going to get worse, not better. I'm not going to fire him and everything goes away. It would be a bigger deal if I fired him, and I knew that. So it was a negative, not a positive. And everybody knew that. But NBC didn't want to play it that way.
They wanted to play it a different way. And when you talk about people that are dishonest, when you talk about bad, fake news, NBC, where we had the ""The Apprentice"" for many years as one of their most successful shows, NBC is as bad as CNN, I can tell you that.
Right.
Well, Schiff is a bad guy. He knew he was lying. I mean, he's not a dummy. He knew he was lying. And for a year and a half, he would go on and just lie and lie and leak and call up CNN and others and just -- you know, I watch him, so sanctimonious, and gets on and says, oh, we want to talk about Russia. He knew it was a lie and he would get into the back room with his friends and the Democrat Party, and they would laugh like hell at what they were doing.
It's a disgrace. And he knew it was a lie. And therefore, in one way, you could say it's a crime what he did, because he was giving, I mean, horrible -- making horrible statements that he knew were false, and frankly, I heard they should force them off the committee, or if the committee chair. He should be forced out of office.
He is a disgrace to our country. And you have plenty of others. But he would go on night after night, talking about collusion, the collusion delusion. And I will tell you this about Russia, if they had anything on me, it would have come out a long time ago, probably a long time before I ran because they would have been much better off.
I hope we really get along well with them but they would have been a lot better off with Hillary Clinton as president. In terms of energy, in terms of oil and gas, look at what we are doing with the energy. It's incredible in our country. But that's a bad thing --
-- competition for Russia. Hillary wouldn't let you drill, there would be no oil, there would be no gas, there wouldn't be anything to compete. Russia, if they were at all for me -- by the way, if you look at all of the things, they were sort of for and against both, not just one way -- but you look at all of the different things, Russia much rather have Hillary than Donald Trump.
I can tell you that right now.
No, not really. I did feel that way very much, the night I won, they were all screaming ""locker up, locker up."" Look, she lost 33 -- they deleted 33,000 emails, and they were Bleach Bit, that's a big deal, a very expensive process. And almost nobody does it because it's so expensive. But that's the way you really get rid of it. So she deleted 33,000 emails.
Can you imagine if I did that? Supposing I did that, I gave millions of pages to these people that were --
-- the case that was involved with the Clinton Foundation, and another case, Weissmann, you know all about Weissmann, and many others. We gave millions of pages, they found nothing. If they were up have found one bad sentence out of millions of pages, believe me, it would have been front and center. It would have been front and center.
But it's true, when I, on November 8th, '16, one of the great nights that a lot of people have had, since they came from the hills and the mountains, they came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, Sean. It was an incredible evening. And, you know, they have been rewarded because our job numbers, our unemployment numbers, all of the numbers that they really wanted are the best we have ever had.
But I will say this, I said, you know, let's get back on, let's not think about the past, let's think about the future. But now, I think thinking about the past is just OK because we can never let this happen again in our country or to another president. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking into the future.
We can never allow this treasonous -- these treasonous acts to happen to another president. This was an attempted takeover of our government, of our country, an illegal takeover. If it were the other way around, where I was doing it to President Obama or a Democrat, it would be virtually the maximum sentence that you can find no matter where you look in whatever legal book.
Yes, it didn't seem to be biased. It was biased.
It was tremendously anti-Trump. It was Never Trumpers, it was anti-Trump. I think in every single instance, I know that Andrew Weissmann was at her -- I guess you'd call it the wake, which was the big evening on November 8th, he was there to celebrate, you know, to celebrate a victory, he was there, and not a happy camper.
But these were people that contributed, most of them, contributed to her campaign. I mean, it was a shocking to see it. So, you know, I wasn't exactly sure -- I know one thing, I had nothing to do with Russia, but I wasn't exactly -- when I looked at the team that was assembled, I wasn't exactly sure what they -- you know, maybe they would take a sentence from here and a sentence from there, I had no idea.
I know one thing, I was the most innocent human being -- and they all said it, even Comey said he found no wrongdoing -- and one of the few times he didn't like him because he lied in front of Congress. Brennan lied. Many of these people lied to Congress and nothing happened. And yet with Flynn, where they didn't even know if he lied based on --
-- what the reports are, and others, look what happened to them on the other side. But these people with so many lies, and lies before Congress, which is just about the ultimate, sworn testimony where Comey told so much, and he leaked classified information. Well, if somebody in our team leaked classified information, it would be years in jail.
So nobody can understand what went on. Nobody really understands one of other thing, when the report came out, why didn't they look at all of these acts on the other side? Was it they only looked at our people? Now, all of that being said, the end result, it took a long time, almost two years, but the end result is no collusion, and no obstruction.
But it took a long time to get there.
I do, I have plans to declassify and release. I have plans to absolutely release. But I have some very talented people working for me, lawyers. And they really didn't want me to do it early on. Devin Nunes, by the way, and Meadows, you look at Jim Jordan, and all of the people, they worked so hard. And a lot of people wanted me to do it a long time ago.
I'm glad I didn't do it. We got a great result without having to do it but we well. One of the reasons that my lawyers didn't want me to do it is they said, if I do it, they will call it a form of obstruction, so they will say, oh, you released these documents so we would make all of this information transparent.
You know, and politics you always hear transparency. It would make it transparent. And then they call it obstruction, knowing the people we are dealing with. So, frankly, I thought it would be better if we held it to the end. No, but at the right time, we will be absolutely releasing it. I did the right thing by not doing it so far.
But you understand, they would call it something that it wouldn't be. It's the only time you would be transparent where they would say bad things about transparency.
Right.
Yes.
Well, I think Brennan is a sick person. I think there's something wrong for him. And I watch -- for him to come out of the CIA and act that way was so disrespectful to the country and to the CIA and to the position he held. And he was not considered good at what he did. He was never respected guy. Tough guy but not a respected guy.
But he lied to Congress. And the other night before the report came out, he predicted horrible things. Things he said were horrible. Then today, I guess he said something -- I didn't see it but I heard he said, well, I must have bad sources or bad information. I mean, this is a man who really is either sick or there is some other problem.
But the way he spoke -- and as you know, clapper lied, and perhaps the statute of limitations ran out on that one but it didn't run out on Comey, it didn't run out on Brennan or Strzok or Page or McCabe. I mean, McCabe, his wife got hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was running the FBI and running all sorts of cases, and his wife got hundreds of thousands of dollars from essentially Clintons, from Clinton's closest friend.
Then he ruled so favorably. I mean, he tried to say he was not involved, I don't think too many people believe that, I did not believe that. But she got all those good rulings. It's really a scandalous situation. It is so badly that it reflects it so horribly, a guy like Ohr with his wife, Nellie Ohr, and GPS Fusion.
She wrote the report, and the goes, gives it to her husband who is at the DOJ, and then he goes and brings it to the FBI, and she's getting paid for doing it. It's incredible.
The things that happened are incredible, and very, very bad for our country.
We have repaired, I mean, literally -- you know, many, many miles. I could give you numbers but many, many miles. We are building many miles. We're going to have hundreds of miles already under construction are soon to be under construction. Billions of dollars will be necessary. It's absolutely vital if you look at what's happening at the border, it's terrible with the human traffickers, the drugs, everything that is coming across, and that goes across the soft points, which are the points without the wall.
And we will have hundreds of miles built fairly quickly. Billions of dollars, we took a billion dollars in today. And I'm building and much less expensively than it was in the past. If you look at the past, they were talking about $25 billion to $30 billion. I'm building it for a fraction of that. The wall is better.
It's going up faster. The Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job working with us and we have some real professionals, and the military has been incredible, putting up the barbed wire, essentially, it's barbed wire. It's actually barb wire plus. But it's incredible what they have done. You have seen it. I mean, you know, many, many miles of wire.
If we didn't have it, we would really have a problem. But we are really capturing -- let's use the word capturing -- we are capturing people that are coming in illegally, we are not just releasing them, in some cases, we are running out of room, and many cases now, we are running out of room. The laws are so bad, normally you just bring them back by the laws don't let you do that.
Our laws that could be easily changed by the Democrats, but they are so bad and so corrupt on immigration, whether it's catch and release or chain migration or any of the various things that we have to put up with, it's terrible. So -- but we are doing fantastic. We are building -- in fact, into weeks, I'm going to a location, it's going to be in California, believe it or not, they were begging us to build in San Diego, begging us to build a wall and we are just in the process of completing a major stretch of many miles of wall, and we are going to have a news conference there just to show people.
It's really good stuff. It's better, less expensive, goes up faster, but it's actually better than what they were doing before. So we are going to have it done and we are in great shape. We got a great support from the Republicans, both in Congress, if you look at our congressmen and women and from the Senate.
I really had great support. A couple of them people voted against but you know what? That's OK, they had their reasons. We had great support.
Many billions, yes. Many billions. You go to a lot of the generals, they will tell you, this is a national emergency. This is -- we need to defend our country. You have people pouring in. I mean, they are pouring -- we are capturing these people, we are getting them. But, you know, we don't do like other countries, other countries stand there with machine guns ready to fire.
We can't do that and I wouldn't want to do that, OK? It's a very effective way of doing it and I wouldn't want to do it. We can't do it. But we do -- if we have barriers, we have the walls like we are building now, and building -- a lot of people don't think we are building walls, we are building massive, many, many miles of walls right now, and we are gearing up to do many more.
We'll have hundreds of miles of walls built in the very near -- built and renovated, too, a lot of it, we were able to use the old carcass of a wall. We fixed it and we -- for a smaller amount of money, we were able to build a wall that is literally just as good as new. So we've done a lot of work on it, and a lot of talent has been involved, and we've had really a tremendous help, a lot of people agree.
I mean, most people agree. Even the Democrats agree. They don't say that. They go into back rooms, like I said before about Schiff, they go back there and they laugh. But they go into the room and -- everyone knows you need the wall. The Democrats, almost every one of them, voted for the walls in the past.
But now, they don't because they don't want to give us a victory. But they are hurting the country. They are not hurting me, they are hurting the country.
Well, I don't want to speak badly about the New Green Deal, Sean, because, frankly, I'm afraid they will stop using it, because I really do want to campaign against it. It's ridiculous, all right, it's crazy. It will cost $100 trillion. Nobody knows what that means. That means is more money than you have in the world.
And it will be catastrophic. It's not going to happen. It's just talk. And, of course, they will campaign on it. They'll say, we're going to give free everything. You're going to end up being Venezuela if that's happening. We have a nice big problem with Venezuela. You look at Venezuela, was a wealthy country not long ago, and now, it's one of the poorest countries.
We'll end up being the same thing. The New Green Deal is ridiculous, but I don't want to speak badly because I want them to keep going forward with it. I really look forward to campaigning, just a little bit early, just like Elizabeth Warren. I hit her too hard, too early, and now it looks like she's finished.
I wish she would have been in the race and frankly, I would have loved to have run against her but I would say she's probably finished. But they have plenty left. New Green Deal is going nowhere.
Well, you don't have to go to other countries when you see what is going on in this country -- yesterday, I was very honored to do the Golan Heights. That was something that was promised by many, many presidents over many, many years, and I got it done. Then you look at also Jerusalem, moving the embassy to Jerusalem.
For years, many presidents for many decades campaigned on it. They were going to do it and they never did it because frankly, it was much tougher to do than people whatever ever understand. It was very tough. I understand why they ultimately didn't do it, they didn't get it done, but I got it done. Not only did I get it done, I got the embassy belt for a fraction, a tiny, tiny fraction of the cost of what it was supposed to cost.
And now, as you know, the embassy is open. It's not just designated, it's open in Jerusalem. So, look, I'm very proud of what we have done for Israel. I'm very proud of my relationship with Israel, and what is going on with the Democrats, and with Jewish people and the Democrats and Israel is a shocking to me. You know, I grew up in a world where people really -- and Democrats, they loved Israel.
And now, I'm looking at a world where many Democrats seem to hate Israel. They seem to despise Israel. It is a tremendous surprise to me. What's going on with Israel and the Democrat Party is absolutely horrific. Terrible.
Well, first of all, let me say that Devin Nunes is someday going to be hailed as a great American hero. They tried to destroy that man because he spoke up for good and just and all of the things that you have to speak up for. But most people don't have the courage to do it. He will be someday hailed as a great American hero, what he did.
They tried to ruin him. They tried to destroy him. They tried to ruin his life and his family. And he just kept plugging like there was nothing going on. I mean, it was an amazing thing. As far as your other part of the question, in September, if you look, supposedly, the FBI told president Obama all about Russia trying to get involved in some form in the election, and he decided to do nothing about it because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.
So he didn't want to do anything because he thought that Clinton was going to win and he didn't want to upset the apple cart. But he knew about it. And the question is, one of the many, many questions, and this is probably not as big as other questions, because you are talking about major, major treason and corrupt -- all the things.
But one of the questions is, why didn't he do something? He knew about it. This wasn't up to me. I wasn't president when all this was happening. Why didn't President Obama and the Obama administration do something when they were informed about Russia and the election?
I think it's very important to know that Russia or anybody else had no impact on votes. That is very important for people to know. That has been coming out, as you know, from every agency, everybody that has done it. So whether they tried, and how hard they tried, and President Obama knew, the bottom line is, they had a zero impact on the election of 2016. I'm very happy about that.
That is what we are all about. We can't allow that to happen in any way, shape, or form. But we are putting very strong safeguards and, this sounds a little old-fashioned, but the best backup is a paper back up, not a computer back up, and we have many paper backups, just in case there is a problem, something which they didn't have before.
But we are being very vigilant and working very hard --
-- and we have tremendous systems in place, Sean.
We're going to do great. We are going along with Texas, we are winning the case, and we're going to have great health care. The Republican Party will be the party of great healthcare. You watch.
All included. We're going to have pre-existing conditions, absolutely, and we already got rid of the individual mandate, which was costing people a fortune. It was terrible.
Thank you very much, Sean.

Ulysses S. Grant,United States of America,1874-04-22 00:00:00,"To the Senate of the United States:
Herewith I return, Senate bill No. 617, entitled ""An act to fix the amount of United States notes and the circulation of national banks, and for other purposes,"" without my approval.
In doing so I must express my regret at not being able to give my assent to a measure which has received the sanction of a majority of the legislators chosen by the people to make laws for their guidance, and have studiously sought to find sufficient arguments to justify such assent, but unsuccessfully.
Practically it is a question whether the measure under discussion would give an additional dollar to the irredeemable paper currency of the country or not, and whether by requiring three-fourths of the reserve to be retained by the banks and prohibiting interest to be received on the balance it might not prove a contraction.
But the fact can not be concealed that theoretically the bill increases the paper circulation $100,000,000, less only the amount of reserves restrained from circulation by the provision of the second section. The measure has been supported on the theory that it would give increased circulation. It is a fair inference, therefore, that if in practice the measure should fail to create the abundance of circulation expected of it the friends of the measure, particularly those out of Congress, would clamor for such inflation as would give the expected relief.
The theory, in my belief, is a departure from true principles of finance, national interest, national obligations to creditors, Congressional promises, party pledges (on the part of both political parties), and of personal views and promises made by me in every annual message sent to Congress and in each inaugural address.
In my annual message to Congress in December, 1869, the following passages appear:
Among the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to, is that of an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest attention. It is a duty, and one of the highest duties, of Government to secure to the citizen a medium of exchange of fixed, unvarying value. This implies a return to a specie basis, and no substitute for it can be devised. It should be commenced now and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class. Immediate resumption, if practicable, would not be desirable. It would compel the debtor class to pay, beyond their contracts, the premium on gold at the date of their purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluctuation, however, in the paper value of the measure of all values (gold) is detrimental to the interests of trade. It makes the man of business an involuntary gambler, for in all sales where future payment is to be made both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be paid and received. I earnestly recommend to you, then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of currency.
I still adhere to the views then expressed.
As early as December 4, 1865, the House of Representatives passed a resolution, by a vote of 144 yeas to 6 nays, concurring ""in the views of the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to the necessity of a contraction of the currency, with a view to as early a resumption of specie payments as the business interests of the country will permit,"" and pledging ""cooperative action to this end as speedily as possible.""
The first act passed by the Forty-first Congress, (approved) on the 18th day of March, 1869, was as follows:
AN ACT to strengthen the public credit
Be it enacted, etc., That in order to remove any doubt as to the purpose of the Government to discharge all just obligations to the public creditors, and to settle conflicting questions and interpretations of the law by virtue of which such obligations have been contracted, it is hereby provided and declared that the faith of the United States is solemnly pledged to the payment in coin or its equivalent of all the obligations of the United States not bearing interest, known as United States notes, and all the interest-bearing obligations of the United States, except in cases where the law authorizing the issue of any such obligation has expressly provided that the same may be paid in lawful money or in other currency than gold and silver; but none of the said interest-bearing obligations not already due shall be redeemed or paid before maturity unless at such time United States notes shall be convertible into coin at the option of the holder, or unless at such time bonds of the United States bearing a lower rate of interest than the bonds to be redeemed can be sold at par in coin. And the United States also solemnly pledges its faith to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the redemption of the United States notes in coin.
This act still remains as a continuing pledge of the faith of the United States ""to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the redemption of the United States notes in coin.""
A declaration contained in the act of June 30, 1864, created an obligation that the total amount of United States notes issued or to be issued should never exceed $400,000,000. The amount in actual circulation was actually reduced to $356,000,000, at which point Congress passed the act of February 4, 1868, suspending the further reduction of the currency. The forty-four millions have ever been regarded as a reserve, to be used only in case of emergency, such as has occurred on several occasions, and must occur when from any cause revenues suddenly fall below expenditures; and such a reserve is necessary, because the fractional currency, amounting to fifty millions, is redeemable in legal tender on call.
It may be said that such a return of fractional currency for redemption is impossible; but let steps be taken for a return to a specie basis and it will be found that silver will take the place of fractional currency as rapidly as it can be supplied, when the premium on gold reaches a sufficiently low point. With the amount of United States notes to be issued permanently fixed within proper limits and the Treasury so strengthened as to be able to redeem them in coin on demand it will then be safe to inaugurate a system of free banking with such provisions as to make compulsory redemption of the circulating notes of the banks in coin, or in United States notes, themselves redeemable and made equivalent to coin.
As a measure preparatory to free banking, and for placing the Government in a condition to redeem its notes in coin ""at the earliest practicable period,"" the revenues of the country should be increased so as to pay current expenses, provide for the sinking fund required by law, and also a surplus to be retained in the Treasury in gold.
I am not a believer in any artificial method of making paper money equal to coin when the coin is not owned or held ready to redeem the promises to pay, for paper money is nothing more than promises to pay, and is valuable exactly in proportion to the amount of coin that it can be converted into. While coin is not used as a circulating medium, or the currency of the country is not convertible into it at par, it becomes an article of commerce as much as any other product. The surplus will seek a foreign market as will any other surplus. The balance of trade has nothing to do with the question. Duties on imports being required in coin creates a limited demand for gold. About enough to satisfy that demand remains in the country. To increase this supply I see no way open but by the Government hoarding through the means above given, and possibly by requiring the national banks to aid.
It is claimed by the advocates of the measure herewith returned that there is an unequal distribution of the banking capital of the country. I was disposed to give great weight to this view of the question at first, but on reflection it will be remembered that there still remains $4,000,000 of authorized bank-note circulation assigned to States having less than their quota not yet taken. In addition to this the States having less than their quota of bank circulation have the option of twenty-five millions more to be taken from those States having more than their proportion. When this is all taken up, or when specie payments are fully restored or are in rapid process of restoration, will be the time to consider the question of ""more currency.""

Carwyn Jones,United Kingdom,2015-11-30,"Cadeirydd, gynhadledd.
Chair, Conference.
Thank you Owen for that introduction and thank you for the work you’re doing at Westminster holding the Tories and Lib Dems to account.
You’ll hear much during this conference about the harm the Tories and Lib Dems are wreaking on ordinary families up and down the land:
– their one-size-fits-all approach to welfare reform;
– and their laissez-faire approach to the economy which has resulted in so many young people being out of work.
Their iniquitous bedroom tax, which penalises the disabled in particular.
Well done Ed!
Your pledge to do away with this morally bankrupt policy will bring hope to 40,000 households in Wales and many more across the rest of the UK which have been blighted by this tax.
Well, let me tell you some of the things we – as a Welsh Labour Government – have been doing to stand up for the people of Wales during these difficult times.
Our greatest focus as a Government has been on jobs and growth.
Trying to make the difference to the lives of people in Wales and not rely on the failed Tory policies which have blighted the rest of the UK since 2010.
As a result of our actions, in Wales, things are going in the right direction.
Over the last 12 months, employment, unemployment and economic inactivity rates in Wales have all moved in a positive direction and outperformed the UK average.
Since 1999 there has been a 101.2 per cent increase in Welsh exports, the fourth largest of any UK region and compared to an increase of 79.2 per cent for the whole of the UK.
Wales is on the up under Labour.
On inward investment into Wales, we are transforming the picture compared to some parts of the rest of the UK.
Over the last 12 months there have been 67 foreign direct inward investment projects for Wales, creating 2,605 new jobs and safeguarding another 4,857.
Through our ‘Our Business Start-up programme’ we’ve helped establish 6,800 new enterprises and that has helped create more than 13,433 jobs.
Conference one of the first things the Tories did when they came to power back in 2010, was to axe the Future Jobs Fund.
By contrast one of the first things the Welsh Labour did it when elected in 2011, was to introduce a Welsh version of that scheme – what we call, Jobs Growth Wales.
I am proud to stand here today and tell you that over the last 18 months we’ve created eight and a half thousand job opportunities for young people aged between 16 and 24 – with six and a half thousand of those going on to find work.
Conference – Labour delivering hope for young people in Wales for the future!
When it comes to tackling poverty, we are equally as focused.
In England you are witnessing the cuts to Sure Start.
In Wales we have Flying Start and by the end of this year nearly 28,000 children and their families will be receiving support from the programme.
It means we are on track to double the number of children benefitting from Flying Start by 2016.
Also Conference, I am proud to stand here today and tell you that, the Welsh Government introduced a support programme for Remploy workers who were abandoned by the Tories in Wales.
Our funding has helped 117 Remploy workers find new jobs – that’s a 117 disabled workers who faced redundancy thanks to Tory closures.
You see, as a Welsh Labour Government, we don’t have different policies for the sake of being different.
We have different policies in Wales because they’re right for our people.
Right for our young people – who need hope for the future.
Right for our older people – who need security and certainty.
Right for our vulnerable people – who need a government that cares.
Conference, we are building a Wales that’s a living, breathing example of what Labour values can achieve when in Government.
So, what are we doing to make Wales a fairer, more equal country with more opportunity for our people?
Well, for a start – when it comes to the NHS, there’s no market, no privatisation, no unworkable reform agenda.
Our NHS – the Welsh NHS – remains true to Bevan’s founding principles and remains true to ethos that has served it well since inception.
We have kept free prescriptions.
We’ve increased access to GPs.
And I’m proud to tell you that we recently passed a new law which means Wales will have the first opt-out system for organ donation anywhere in the UK – potentially providing organs to some of the 50 people in Wales who die every year waiting on the transplant list.
In education, we have introduced the Foundation Phase for the youngest children –a curriculum based on learning through experience.
Despite fierce opposition from the Lib Dems and Tories over many years, we have kept Free School Breakfasts for our children.
Yes conference  – the same Lib Dems and Tories who last week adopted Welsh Labour policy and will now follow our example in England.
We welcome their conversion, however late it is!
We’ve kept Education Maintenance Allowance to encourage our young people to stay in learning.
And, after the Tory debacle earlier this year, I am proud to say that in Wales we will retain GCSEs and A-levels as key school qualifications.
We will not follow the shambles that Michael Gove has presided over in England.
Conference, every day in Wales, we see tangible benefits of being a part of Europe.
Whether it be helping farmers and rural communities, increasing skills, creating jobs and improving research and innovation at our universities.
Thanks to EU money we have helped 50,000 people across the whole of Wales into work and nearly 140,000 to gain qualifications.
EU funding has invested £110 million in some 500 businesses, helping them grow and create jobs.
Europe is Wales’ largest trading partner and over 600 firms across the country export goods and services worth around £5bn every year to other EU countries.
There are around 150,000 jobs in Wales depending on that trade.
Wales cannot afford to leave the UK and we cannot afford to leave the EU.
As the First Minister of a Welsh Labour Government, I am proud of our strong links with the trades union movement in Wales.
We see trades unions as crucial social partners – just as we do with the CBI, for example.
In Wales, we work with all sectors of Welsh society to make Wales a better and more prosperous place for all of us – whether they be employer or employee.
We have worked with the trades unions to improve the lives  of our people and at a time when working people are under threat, they need trades unions to defend them.
When it comes to workers’ rights in Wales, I am proud of the various stands my Government has taken over the last twelve months.
If you remember one of the first things the Tories signalled when they came to office was their intent to scrap the Agriculture Wages Board and in England, they’ve already done it.
But in Wales – as a Labour Government, we decided not accept this. So we have now passed legislation to protect the wages of over 13,000 farm workers in Wales.
A Welsh Labour Government standing up for workers.
When the Tories tried to undermine UK wide pay agreements by floating the idea of the regional pay, we knew that for thousands of public sector workers in Wales and other parts of England such a move would mean less money for some of the most lowest paid workers in the UK.
Not only did we say “no” in Wales – we backed up our message of opposition with hard facts and hard evidence that destroyed the UK Government’s case to force it through.
Again, a Welsh Labour Government standing up for workers.
And more recently conference, I am proud to say we have taken action to stamp out the heinous practice of blacklisting.
Last week, my government issued a Procurement Advice Note to all Welsh public bodies making clear those circumstances where they can exclude blacklisters from bidding for a public contracts in Wales.
Conference, blacklisting has ruined the careers and livelihoods of good, decent trade unionists all over the UK.
In Wales we have said “enough”.
In Wales, there is a Government that is standing up for workers!
In Wales, we have a Labour Government – we need a Labour in Scotland with Johann as First Minister and we need a Labour Government in London with Ed as Prime Minister.
Working together, we can give people hope.
Show that there is a better way.
And lead the way to a fairer and more prosperous Britain.
In Wales, because of the bedroom tax, there are 40,000 good reasons to elect a Labour Prime Minister.
So let 2015 be the year to give hope.
And let 2015 be the year to win.
Thank you.
Diolch yn fawr.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-08-25,"Thank you very much, everybody. We're having a very good meeting -- a very good series of meetings. Last night, we had dinner. It worked out. I think it was fantastic.
Three that we'll talk about.
He needs no advice. He's the right man for the job. I've been saying that for a long time. It didn’t make your predecessor very happy. But I've been saying it for a long time: He's the right man for the job.
We're having very good trade talks between the UK and ourselves. We're going to do a very big trade deal -- bigger than we've ever had with the UK. And now, they won't have it. At some point, they won't have the obstacle of -- they won't have the anchor around their ankle, because that's what they had. So, we're going to have some very good trade talks and big numbers.
Many things -- many things we’re talking about.
Pretty quickly. We don't anticipate any problems. Before, we were sort of stymied. Well, I was stymied by the other side because nothing went -- nothing got done on the other side, as you've seen from Brexit. This is a different person, and this is a person that's going to be a great prime minister, in my opinion.
Boris, it's only my opinion.
That, I don't know. We did discuss it. We had a very good discussion on Russia and President Putin, and a lively discussion, but, really, a good one. And it's certainly --
It's certainly possible. It's certainly possible. We'll see.
No. Not at all. I haven’t heard that at all, no. I think they respect the trade war. It has to happen. China has been -- I can only speak for the United States. I can't say what they've been doing to the UK and to other places. But from the standpoint of the United States, what they've done is outrageous that Presidents and administrations allowed them to get away with taking hundreds of billions of dollars out every year, putting it into China.
So, the answer is, nobody has told me that, and nobody would tell me that.
Yeah, sure. Why not?
Might as well. Might as well.
I have second thoughts about everything.
Well, I have the right to, if I want. I could declare a national emergency. I think when they steal and take out, and -- intellectual property theft, anywhere from $300 billion to $500 billion a year, and where we have a total loss of almost a trillion dollars a year -- for many years, this has been going on -- in many ways, that's an emergency.
I have no plan right now. Actually, we're getting along very well with China right now. We're talking. I think they want to make a deal much more than I do. We're getting a lot of money in tariffs. It's coming in by the billions. We never got 10 cents from China. So we'll see what happens. But we are talking to China very seriously.
No. The market is doing great. Our country is doing great. Everybody was telling me, yesterday, people are trying to copy the formula. We've cut taxes way down. We got rid of regulations -- large numbers -- more than any President has gotten rid of. And we're doing very well. Our country is doing fantastically well.
I mean, you people want a recession because you think maybe that's the way to get Trump out. Maybe that's the way we get him out. But I don’t even think that would even work, because, look, if there's anything, it's -- you know, we've got to go into trade negotiations to get it right. But, ultimately, it'll be many times what it was before.
Our country is doing really well. We have horrible trade deals, and I'm straightening them out. The biggest one, by far, is China.
How about the last three years. Two-hundred, I agree with you.
We're very close to a major deal with Japan. As you know, Prime Minister Abe and I are very good friends and -- really good friends. We've been working on it for five months. Bob Lighthizer is here someplace. Bob? Do you want to say something about the deal with Japan?
We're working on a very big deal with Japan, and we're very close to getting it. And, frankly, I think what's happening in China helps with respect to Japan. But it's a very big deal. It'll be one of the biggest deals we've ever made with Japan. Okay? Thank you all very much.

Victoria Atkins,United Kingdom,2020-02-29,"With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement on Her Majesty’s inspectorate of police, fire and rescue services’ thematic report on its national child protection inspection programme. This important report was published today and summarises the findings of 64 inspections and re-inspections of police forces’ approaches to child protection since the programme began in 2014.
Keeping our children safe is an absolute priority for this Government, and we welcome Her Majesty’s inspectorate’s work in this area. Protecting vulnerable people should be of utmost importance to the police, and we are committed to ensuring that police forces demonstrate continued improvement in this regard. The activity of our independent inspectorates is critical to our ability to monitor progress and drive change. In the five years since it began, the national child protection inspection programme has been a vital source of independent scrutiny and challenge, and it has been instrumental in driving improvements in the way the police work with vulnerable children. As we know too well, this is an area of police work in which we have seen some of the worst failures in the past.
The report notes that
“we have continued to see an unambiguous commitment from police leaders, officers and staff to the protection of children.”
The report recognises improvements—in some cases, significant improvements—in the service received by children at risk. In every case, when inspectors returned to a police force that had previously been inspected, they saw progress being made and better outcomes for children. They saw examples of good, innovative work, such as the programme in Wales to provide early support to children exposed to adverse childhood experiences. Officers are better at understanding the signs of vulnerability and recognising children who are at risk. We welcome the positive findings in today’s report.
The report is clear, however, that more needs to be done. Although the police have a better understanding of risk, their resources are too often focused on areas of acute risk. Not enough is being done to spot the earliest signs of risk and prevent those risks from escalating. There are concerning findings around the detention of vulnerable children. Children are too often being detained in custody when they should not be, and they are not being appropriately safeguarded in those situations. There are inconsistencies in how forces manage dangerous offenders, and the escalation in the prevalence of digital technology in offending is a significant challenge, meaning that it is taking too long to identify and safeguard children who have been the victims of sexual abuse online.
These are serious matters, and I want to set out the steps the Government are taking to address them. As the Home Secretary stated yesterday, we are an ambitious and dynamic new Government with law and order at our heart. Our mission is clear. It is to deliver on the people’s priorities: to cut crime and to protect the public. We have recognised the huge demands placed on our police forces, and we are addressing these pressures with the recruitment of an unprecedented 20,000 additional ​officers over three years. We are investing a further £1.1 billion in policing next year—taking the total up to £15.2 billion—with the help of police and crime commissioners using their precepts. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary are driving a united Government response with a new cross-Whitehall crime and justice taskforce to ensure that we use every lever at our disposal to fight crime. However, as today’s report makes clear, the rise in high-harm crimes such as serious violence and child sexual abuse is having a particular impact on the most vulnerable, requiring more from our police officers. They need to be able to look beyond the obvious and to develop a deeper understanding of risk.
We have worked with the College of Policing and are providing £1.9 million of funding to develop a more comprehensive package of training for first responders, so that they are better able to identify signs of vulnerability and provide support to victims. We have also funded the police’s own vulnerability, knowledge and practice programme to develop policing best practice in response to vulnerability as a whole. The programme is recognised in today’s report for its work to evaluate best practice in early intervention. We have introduced stronger multi-agency child safeguarding arrangements with shared responsibility between local authorities, police and health partners for the local strategic response to safeguarding, including harms such as child sexual exploitation. Again, these reforms, which were implemented in every local area in England last September, are recognised in today’s report as a key opportunity to deliver the kind of systemic change we need to see.
In relation to the inappropriate detention of children, we will look carefully at the recommendation and do what we can to ensure that vulnerable children receive an appropriate service from the police. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the 2017 concordat on children in custody, which sets out the statutory duties of the police and local authorities and provides a protocol for how transfers should work in practice.
Today’s report also recognises that the nature of risk is changing, and investment in officers and changing police culture are only part of the solution. That is why we are investing in new capabilities to tackle the exploitation of vulnerable children through crimes such as child sexual exploitation, child criminal exploitation and county lines. Last year we announced a £30 million investment in funding for work to tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation in 2020-21. The new funding will include investment in the child abuse image database—CAID—which the Home Office has developed in collaboration with UK law enforcement. CAID is a single database of indecent images of children which enables UK law enforcement to work collaboratively to safeguard children and bring people to justice. The new funding will allow us to deliver upgrades to CAID, including a fast, forensic tool to rapidly analyse seized devices and find images already known to law enforcement; an image categorisation algorithm to assist officers to identify and categorise the severity of illegal imagery; and a capability to detect images with matching scenes to help to identify children in indecent images in order to safeguard victims.
We have announced £25 million of targeted investment across 2019-20 and 2020-21 to strengthen the law enforcement response to county lines and increase the ​support available to the children, young people and families who are affected. This is in addition to establishing the national county lines co-ordination centre, with £3.6 million of Home Office funding, and providing a range of support for county lines victims. We also recognise that by the time children experience these forms of exploitation, the harm has been done. Police and other services need to spot the signs of risk and intervene earlier. Through our £13 million four-year trusted relationships programme, we are trialling 11 innovative projects in England working to protect vulnerable 10 to 17-year-olds who are at high risk of sexual exploitation and other forms of harm. We want to do more, however, which is why this year we will be publishing a first-of-its-kind national strategy to tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation.
We welcome today’s report. The protection of vulnerable children from harm is of the highest priority to this Government, as it should be to our police forces, and the inspectorate’s work in this area is vital in shaping our work in the future. The Home Secretary intends to meet inspectors to discuss today’s report and understand what more we and the police can do to ensure that children receive the highest levels of protection in the future. I commend this statement to the House.

It's been... interesting, because it looked like it was going to be a very small storm, that we all got lucky -- it missed Puerto Rico.
It hit the Virgin Islands, but not as bad as it could have, but it really began to form and form big, and now it's looking like it could be an absolute monster. We're ready. We have the best people in the world ready, and they're gonna help you.
We're shipping food, we're shipping water, but it may be that you're going to evacuate. We're going to see what happens. We're waiting. It does seem almost certain that it's hitting dead center, and that's not good. The winds seem to be building at a tremendous rate. It looks like the winds are gonna be unbelievably high.
We're all ready, and hopefully we'll get lucky, but it looks to me like this time, it's heading in one direction. All indications are it's gonna hit very hard, and it's going to be very big -- somebody said bigger, or at least as big as Andrew, and if you remember Andrew, from many years ago, that was not good.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-01-15,"I have a dream. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s immortal words, delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, have inspired Americans of all background since they were spoken on that historic day in 1963.
Dr. King's dream is our dream. It is the American dream. It's the promise, stitched into the fabric of our nation, etched into the hearts of our people, and written into the soul of humankind. It is the dream of a world where people are judged by who they are, not how they look or where they come from. It is the dream of a nation that offers life of dignity and hope to every American, regardless of color or creed.
It is the dream of a nation faithful to its founding principle that we all created equal. This sacred principle was the cause for which Dr. King, and so many other historic Americans, sacrificed in places like Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery and Memphis. They were heroes who led our nation forward toward a future that is more just and more free.
Fifty years ago the spring, Dr King was cruelly taken from this world by an assassin's bullet. But the promise he fought for could never be taken away. His words, his deeds, they live on forever. And the cause for which he gave his life only gained strength and force and power with the passage of time.
Last week, I was so pleased to be joined by Dr King's niece, Alveda, as I signed into law the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park Act. This important legislation will ensure that the beautiful historic park continues to tell Dr. King's story for generations to come.
On this cherished day, we honor the memory of Reverend King, and we rededicate ourselves to glorious future, where every American from every walk of life can live free from fear, liberated from hatred, and uplifted by boundless love for their fellow citizens.
I ask every citizen to join me in remembering this great American hero, and to carry on his legacy of justice, equality and freedom. God bless the memory of Reverend King and God bless the United States of America.

Ed Miliband,United Kingdom,2015-12-09,"Thank you for those kind introductions.
Thank you Jo, for letting us join you this morning at your fantastic school – and to all of you for coming.
On May the Fifth it will be a year since the General Election.
For many people the local elections are the first chance for people to reflect on whether our country is heading in the right direction.
So I want to talk to you today about what I believe are the big three challenges facing our country.
– The cost of living crisis facing British Families;
– Whether we can meet the British promise by which the next generation should always do better than the last
– And how we build stronger communities.
I wish this Conservative led government was addressing these challenges.
I wish they understood that in tough times, we need to be ambitious about the kind of nation we should to be.
The problem is that because they have decided to cut too far and too fast, they are taking the country in the wrong direction.
1. From Downing Street to your Street.
We would halve the deficit in four years, and so the Tories say that there’s no real difference between us.
The local elections show how wrong they are, because up and country, we can see how Tory values, Tory choices impact our local communities.
Today we published new research that the Tory-led government’s cuts to local government will hit the average family with cuts of £182 per year.
And that’s on top of the cuts to services, the threat of redundancy, the increase in VAT and the tax credit changes which will make the squeeze even tighter, for the squeezed middle.
The scale and pace of these cuts threaten what I call the promise of Britain – the belief that the next generation must do be tter than the last.
Sure Start centres are being closed. Tuition fees trebled. Education Maintenance Allowances and the Future Jobs Fund scrapped.
The safety of our streets in the battle against crime is being put at risk by scrapping 12,000 police officers. While the youth services, leisure centres and after school clubs that help combat the causes of crime are being shut. These cuts threaten to unpick the very fabric of our communities.
No one should be in any doubt: all these cuts are coming direct from Downing Street to your street.
They go too far. And they are coming too fast.
2. Unfairness
But not only are these cuts happening too far and too fast.
We can see the values of this government in the way they make their cuts.
In our most vulnerable communities, in cities like Manchester and Liverpool, the cuts are nearly twice as deep as the national average, and nearly ten times as deep as in places like Windsor.
Communities across England face these threats. Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Corby, Thanet and West Somerset all face the highest level of cuts.
It‘s not about North versus south, it’s about fair versus unfair.
It’s the trademark of this government.
The politics of division.
3. Labour values
We can do something better.
I want us to do more than simply protest.
I want us to be able to protect.
Labour councils are focusing – and will focus – on supporting front-line services. We want to keep communities strong and safe and share the burden of cuts as fairly as possible.
Being a Labour council under this government is not going to be easy.
Labour councillors are being forced to make some hard choices.
But what matters to us is the chance to put our values into action.
We know that means tough decisions.
So Durham, for instance, facing cuts of £266 for an average family, the Labour council asked their residents, what they wanted to protect.
They said adult social care, so Labour protected those services.
But in the Conservative and Liberal Democrat-led Birmingham council, where we are today, adult social care cuts will hurt 11,000 vulnerable people.
The Tories so-called “EasyCouncil” in Barnet, is closing eight children’s centres and cutting sheltered housing wardens for the elderly.
And when it comes to reducing waste, Labour’s Sandwell Council has cut the number of top managers by fifty per cent, so money can go to frontline services.
In Liverpool, ranked by the Audit Commission as having the “worst financial management” in the country under the LibDems Labour’s Joe Anderson and his team found millions of pounds in efficiency savings.
Their reward? Some of the biggest cuts in funding in the country.
So Labour councils will strive to protect what matters most.
Labour councillors will put the communities they serve first.
We will try to make things a little fairer for hard pressed families.
These are our values.
These are the choices we’d make.
If you want a strong first line of defence against cuts that are coming too far, too fast.
If you want the tough decisions taken fairly and openly.
If you want councillors who will be your voice in tough times
Then vote Labour on May the Fifth.
",2011 Speech Launching Local Elections Campaign,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/ed-miliband-2011-speech-launching-local-elections-campaign/
Bernie Sanders,United States of America,2020-08-17,"Good evening. Our great nation is now living in an unprecedented moment. We’re facing the worst public health crisis in 100 years and the worst economic collapse since the great depression. We are confronting systemic racism and the enormous threat to our planet of climate change. And in the midst of all of this, we have a president who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. This election is the most important in the modern history of this country. In response to the unprecedented crises we face, we need an unprecedented response, a movement like never before of people who are prepared to stand up and fight for democracy and decency and against greed, oligarchy, and bigotry. And we need Joe Biden as our next president.
Let me take this opportunity to say a word to the millions of people who supported my campaign this year and in 2016. My friends, thank you for your trust, your support, and the love you showed Jane, me, and our family. Together, we have moved this country in a bold new direction, showing that all of us, black and white, Latino, native American, Asian American, gay and straight, native born and immigrant yearn for a nation based on the principles of justice, love, and compassion. Our campaign ended several months ago, but our movement continues and is getting stronger every day. Many of the ideas we fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream.
But let us be clear, if Donald Trump is reelected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy. At its most basic, this election is about preserving our democracy. During this president’s term, the unthinkable has become normal. He has tried to prevent people from voting, undermine the US Postal Service, deployed the military and federal agents against peaceful protestors, threatened to delay the election, and suggested that he will not leave office if he loses. This is not normal and we must never treat it like it is. Under this administration, authoritarianism has taken root in country. I and my family, and many of yours, know the insidious way authoritarianism destroys democracy, decency, and humanity.
As long as I am here, I will work with progressives, with moderates, and yes, with conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat. This president is not just a threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science, he has put our lives and health in jeopardy. Trump has attacked doctors and scientists trying to protect us from the pandemic while refusing to take strong action to produce the masks, gowns, and gloves our healthcare workers desperately need. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people.
Furthermore, Trump’s negligence has exacerbated the economic crisis we are now experiencing. Since this pandemic began, over 30 million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. Millions of working families are wondering how they will feed their kids and they’re worried that they will be evicted from their homes. And how has Trump responded? Instead of maintaining the $600 a week unemployment supplement that workers were receiving and the $1,200 emergency checks that many of you received, instead of helping small businesses, Trump concocted fraudulent executive orders that do virtually nothing to address the crisis while threatening the very future of social security and Medicare.
But the truth is that even before Trump’s negligent response to this pandemic, too many hardworking families have been caught on an economic treadmill with no hope of ever getting ahead. Together, we must build a nation that is more equitable, more compassionate, and more inclusive. I know that Joe Biden will begin that fight on day one. Let me offer you just a few examples of how Joe will move us forward. Joe supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This will give 40 million workers a pay raise and push the wage scale up for everyone else. Joe will also make it easier for workers to join unions, create 12 weeks of paid family leave, fund universal pre-K for three and four year olds, and make childcare affordable for millions of families.
Joe will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and fight the threat of climate change by transitioning us to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years, these initiatives will create millions of good paying jobs all across our country. As you know, we are the only industrialized nation not to guarantee healthcare for all people. While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage, he has a plan that will greatly expand healthcare and cut the cost of prescription drugs. Further, he will lower the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 down to 60. To help reform our broken criminal justice system, Joe will end private prisons and detention centers, cash bail, and the school to prison pipeline.
And to heal the soul of our nation, Joe Biden will end the hate and division Trump has created. He will stop the demonization of immigrants, the coddling of white nationalists, the racist dog whistling, the religious bigotry, and the ugly attacks on women. My friends, I say to you, to everyone who supported other candidates in the primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election, the future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. We must come together, defeat Donald Trump, and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president. My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine. Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2011-07-11,"Derek Jeter just got 3,000 hits, a great feat, a fantastic guy. I like Derek for a lot of reasons. One of them is he happens to live in one of my buildings and he's a prime prime guy, great.
But the young man, who is also, I mean, just a wonderful young guy, he's like 22 years old, he caught the ball and that ball has great value. He decided to hand it over to Derek and he got wonderful publicity. The fact is at the end of a little period of time, like two weeks when he realizes what he did, he's going to say why did they do this when he has to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to go to work when he needs Money to take care of his family or his future family, he's gonna be saying, I can't believe I did it.
He could have gotten a million dollars for that ball. Whether was four hundred thousand that I read or five hundred thousand, I say a million. Somebody would have paid it, maybe Derek would have paid it.
This guy is a wonderful guy. He's getting tremendous publicity. But mark, my words in two weeks, he's going to say, hey, what did I do now? There's one caveat, maybe the Yankees will see this incredible act of generosity or maybe even Derek and give the guy something substantial for himself.
That would be the perfect ending. He would have done a wonderful thing and would have gotten paid for it. But if that doesn't happen, I'm telling you he made a mistake.
The fact is of the Republicans don't blow it, they can overturn many of the mistakes that have been made over the last two years. And beyond that Obama care so many different things. You must include Obamacare in the negotiations, the Republicans have all of the cars, but if you remember not so long ago during the lame-duck session in December, the Republicans had two cards and they blew it and Obama came back stronger than ever before.
So if the Republicans are smart and there's a question as to whether or not they fully understand what's going on, if the Republic are smart, they can use the debt-ceiling to bring this country back and bring it back fast. They must be smart. They must be tough.
And they cannot break if they break and there's a real possibility they will. We're gonna be right back to the same old stuff. Recently, I bought a great vineyard and winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, which is absolutely one of the most beautiful places and a very progressive state with a fantastic governor.
Okay? So what did I do? I went to auction and bought something that probably cost about a hundred and fifty million to build. I bought it for six point, two million dollars, would I have paid more? Absolutely. But I watched this, I studied it, I had certain advantages over other people.
I got it for six point, two million dollars, I got it for a bargain. The point in bringing this is that the Wall Street Journal wrote a front-page story about it last week. It became a front-page story.
Everybody said what a great deal. I don't think about it as a good deal or a bad deal. I think about it this way.
This is what the country should be doing. This is the way we should be negotiating our trade pacts. This is the kind of thinking we need, not because it's my deal, we have to start making good deals or we're going to be a very, very poor country very, very soon.
We're already a debtor nation, but we're going to be a very poor debtor nation. We need the proper.

Theresa May,United Kingdom,2019-01-10,"Prime Minister Abe. It is a pleasure to welcome you to Downing Street.
The UK and Japan are natural partners. Thriving, innovative, island nations – committed to defending the global rules that we have shaped together.
Your visit comes at a crucial time. As the UK prepares to leave the EU and raise our horizons towards the rest of the world, our relationship with countries such as Japan will be increasingly important, and your Presidency of this year’s G20 allows us to work together towards our shared goals on the global stage.
Our people face many of the same challenges. But we also both have immense opportunities. And today we agree a deep and dynamic partnership to shape the 21st Century together.
Japan and the UK, as the world’s third and fifth largest economies, are already close economic partners. Japanese companies employ 150 thousand people here in Britain and trade between our two countries totalled £28 billion in the past year.
Our exit from the EU provides an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen this trade and investment relationship.
I welcome your renewed commitment, Prime Minister Abe, to us securing an ambitious bilateral arrangement, building on the deal already agreed between Japan and the EU. This gives businesses the stability and confidence to plan for the future, supports jobs, and gives more choice and lower prices to consumers.
Our enhanced bilateral relationship will also allow us to explore ways to go further.
We are already opening up export markets by ending the ban on sales of British beef and lamb to Japan. This will create opportunities worth over £120 million over five years, supporting farmers from the valleys of South Wales to the Highlands of Scotland.
Our enhanced co-operation shows that, at a time when global tensions are escalating, we stand together to promote free and fair trade.
As two of the world’s most innovative economies, we are uniquely placed to address the Grand Challenges of our time: an ageing society, the need for clean growth, how we respond to the increasing use of AI and data, and the future of mobility.
Today we mark the start of a significant joint programme of research and collaboration that will transform the way people live in the 21st Century.
British and Japanese experts, working side by side, will help people live independently in their home for longer, develop new treatments for chronic conditions like dementia and heart failure, and ensure a cleaner world for future generations.
Together we will also ensure businesses and innovators are able to use big data legally, ethically and safely in the future. This is our modern Industrial Strategy in action.
Our two cultures already inspire one another’s people. A quarter of a million Japanese tourists come to the UK each year, and we see growing numbers of British tourists visiting Japan.
As part of our cultural exchange the National Gallery will send a major exhibition to Japan – including the famous ‘Sunflowers’ by Vincent Van Gogh, a painter himself inspired by Japanese art.
And with Japan set to host the Rugby World Cup in 2019 and the Olympics and Paralympics in 2020, the UK is sharing our experience of delivering these events safely and successfully.
Global economic growth is underpinned by security.
In Tokyo, we signed a Joint Declaration that transformed our defence partnership and stepped up our collective response to the threats we both face.
We saw the strength of our relationship when Japan added its voice to condemn the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. I want to thank you, Shinzo, for the support your nation showed.
This year, we are increasing the number of combined exercises between our defence forces – on sea, land and air.
And we will deploy the Royal Navy warship HMS Montrose to the region, following on from three naval visits in the past twelve months.
This will help us to enforce sanctions against the DPRK as part of our joint determination to a peaceful resolution to tension in the region and the complete denuclearisation of North Korea.
I also welcome our collaboration on new technologies, including exploring co-operation on future combat aircraft and missile development that will ensure our forces remain an effective deterrent, while supporting high-skilled jobs and industries.
Working closely with Japan and our partners in the region ensures a more connected Asia that is free, open and stable.
And British expertise will help deliver infrastructure projects in the Pacific region, unlocking commercial opportunities for companies across the UK.
2019 is an historic year for Japan. We look forward to working closely with you to ensure a more peaceful, prosperous world.
And I am confident that our shared optimism and close friendship will see our nations stand together to shape our shared future.

When I visited the United Kingdom in April of this year, she gave me a special welcome by inviting me to the Chequers. As I return a favour, I had the pleasure to invite Prime Minister May to Kyoto and it was a delight that we were able to enjoy tea in a very traditional Omotesenke. And of course, at the Kyoto State Guest House, it’s a very traditionally Japanese architect, unlike here at the Akasaka Guest State House, but we did have a very candid and deep conversation together over dinner.
And in that sense, I very much was delighted that we were able to have a very candid conversation about the regional issues together. At a time of change and unpredictability, I put great and ever more importance with the United Kingdom as a global strategic partner that shares fundamental values such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.
I also would like to offer my respect to Prime Minister May’s leadership as she steers her country towards the departure from the European Union. Taking the opportunity of, Theresa, your visit to Japan, I hope to make it a huge step forward to elevate our relationship to a new level and would like to work hand in hand with you to robustly develop our bilateral ties between Japan and the United Kingdom.
Thank you, thank you very much, and I am delighted to be able to be here in Japan, and I would like to thank you for the welcome that you have given me. And I was particularly pleased on, as you say, my first visit to Japan, to be able to sample some traditional Japanese culture, as well as some very productive meetings.
As you say, this is an important time for the United Kingdom as we are preparing and negotiating for our exit from the European Union. And as we do so, we are looking to enhance our partnerships, our ties and our links with countries around the world with whom we have had good longstanding relationships, but with whom we can build further cooperation in the future, and Japan is a key country for the United Kingdom. And we already have good cooperation and partnerships in investment between our two countries, with – between businesses, and the Business Forum today was a very good opportunity for further links to be made.
And there will be further work for us to do on enhancing our trade relationship, but also in security and defence, as we both see the same challenges and threats around the world. And as two nations, island nations, that believe in the rule of law, in the rules-based international order, and have the same values, I believe it is important that we work together.

You know, when you have somebody and you're married it's a little different. And I do love the institution. What I don't like is if you have to dissolve it.
It gets very nasty. It's not a pretty picture.
No, no, no. she's actually not. But it's not a pretty picture I found that out with Ivana. I found it out to a much lesser extent with Marla
But Ivana was quite vicious in going after me.
You really stuck up for me, Howard.
That may have been the most complimentary quote I've ever had. Forget about making lots of money it doesn't mean anything. That was the ultimate.
Number one selling point, and that was, that was a nice headline. I very much appreciate it.
Yeah, sadly.
Well, I had a good time. He was a great guy, he was a great friend of mine. I was a terrible thing. That was unbelievable.
Well, I guess you could say that. It was terrible.
That's great. And of course, you know you're always welcome on the show whenever you want to be. Well, I know that. But you know, I just selfishly -- I would have really missed you and I really felt that there was no
But I look at the ratings and you know for the people that -- I look at the ratings the ratings are huge.
I just felt they probably had no choice. I would love to see the inclusion. I heard Penny before.
You know, just trust me, Penny, wherever hell you are. It was huge.
I'm going to go to Florida I'll be in Palm Beach.
I like Penny a lot. I would not bang her.
I wouldn't do that. Out of respect for her.
Well, I love you, I love you both, have a good time. Congratulations.
I'll see you soon, Howard.
",Interview: Donald Trump on The Howard Stern Show,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-howard-stern-show-december-15-2000
Danny Alexander,United Kingdom,2015-02-22,"Good morning, it’s a pleasure to be here at the IFS.
When this coalition government came into office, Britain faced some of the most substantial fiscal challenges anywhere in the world.
We had the largest forecast budget deficit in the G20 – bigger than many of those European countries whose fiscal challenges are regularly in the news.
The gap between what we raised and what we spent was the greatest in our post-war history.
It’s because of this Government’s leadership that we have sheltered the UK economy from the worst of the storm that continues to affect our Eurozone neighbours.
Britain is contributing to the global rescue package, not seeking support from it.
It’s worth remembering that it’s almost two years since the first Greek bailout, the trigger for a crisis that rumbles on today.
In contrast, only two weeks ago, Standard &amp; Poors reaffirmed the UK’s triple A rating with a stable outlook.
In S&amp;P words “We believe that the UK Government maintains a strong commitment to implementing its fiscal mandate, and has the ability and willingness to respond rapidly to economic challenges.”
Fiscal discipline is not ideological.
It is core to good Government. And it necessary to deliver fairness too.
Be in no doubt, it is the poorest and most disadvantaged, not the wealthy, who are hit hardest when a country loses control of its public finances.
It is fair that we tackle our debts today so that we don’t burden our children tomorrow.
Ensuring that we can continue to provide high quality public services and support to those who need it the most.
And even as we take the tough decisions to tackle that debt, we are making sure that it’s not the poor and vulnerable who are forced to carry the burden, and that those who have the most contribute the most.
Secondly, fiscal discipline is the vital precondition of growth.
Our commitment to fiscal discipline and economic stability has helped secure record low market interest rates.
Rates that support households paying mortgages, and businesses securing loans, right across the UK.
It is that credibility that is the essential precondition for private sector investment, growth and job creation…
226,000 new private sector jobs in the last year
634,000 since we came into Government
Private sector growth built on a foundation of economic stability.
Our Budget went even further in that ambition.
Sticking to our plans on fiscal consolidation to safeguard our economic stability.
Driving through reforms to support the private sector enterprise and innovation that is critical to our recovery.
Reforms that include an extra one percent cut in corporation tax…reducing it to 22 per cent by 2014.
The lowest rate in the G7, the fourth lowest in the G20.
Cutting the ineffective top rate of tax…a rate that was higher than the likes of America, Germany, Italy and France – and replacing it with new measures that ask the wealthy to pay 5 times more than the cost of lowering the top rate.
Increasing the personal allowance – within a hairs breadth now of our £10,000 tax free goal – through the largest tax cut for a generation for the working people of this country.
Investing to provide ultra-fast broadband in ten super-connected cities, with plans to fund a second wave of cities.
And continuing to support the establishment of a new Pension Infrastructure Platform owned by pension funds to bring as much as £2bn of investment by early 2013.
Investment that is critical to renewing our nation’s infrastructure, and catalysing growth in key and established industries right across the UK.
Of course, the damaging legacy of the financial crisis, and the headwinds in the global economy, means the road to recovery is a long one.
The latest assessment of the scale of the damage done to our economy by the financial crisis shows that the damage is greater than was thought at the time.
According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the part of our deficit that is structural was greater than previously thought.
The structural element of the deficit is the part that will not disappear as a consequence of economic growth – it requires policy choices, tax rises or spending cuts, to deal with it.
Put simply, our economy is now forecast to be 11% smaller than it would have been had the crisis not taken place.
For every £9 we thought we would have, we will only have £8. We simply can’t afford to go on spending and borrowing as a country as if we will still have the £9.
There were basically three options about how we could have reacted.
We could have done nothing- and put at risk our country’s economic credibility, seemingly as the official opposition continue to urge us to do.
Or we could cut more now.
But when you have set out detailed spending plans as we have done, credibility comes from implementing those plans, not tearing them up.
The credibility which we have secured means that we have not been forced by the markets to tear up our plans because of rising interest rates and economic instability – as some in Europe have been forced to do.
Instead, we set out plans for further spending reductions into the next parliament.
We have made clear that the total amount of public spending in this country will fall at the same annual pace as in this Parliament, for a further two years.
The OBR forecasts that at that point we will have successfully eliminated the structural current budget deficit as promised, and of course different political parties will quite properly have different ideas for the appropriate path thereafter.
But even as we galvanise our efforts to tackle the deficit, we are also concentrating our minds on the much longer term prospects for public spending.
As last year’s OBR Fiscal Sustainability Report said “There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the scale of the fiscal challenge that confronts future Governments, but the fact there is such a challenge is not in doubt”
Quite simply, the world is a different place to than it was two, ten or twenty years ago. These are pressures that have been building for many years.
The simple truth is that the choices we faced in the last Spending Review and the choices that will have to be made in the next Spending Review are inescapable.
If we want to continue to act fairly, improve social mobility, provide good public services,  provide capital investment that continues to grow, and educate a workforce that is able to drive this economy forward, we will need to work out where and how we save to make those things possible.
And we will need to respond so some of the huge challenges that governments in the past have mistakenly believed they could afford to duck.
That debate is a vital one for the country in the coming years.
But today I want to dwell in more detail on the progress we are making on the plan we have set out, and announce some further measures that reinforce our commitment to delivering on it.
In an environment of economic uncertainty, with ongoing instability in the Eurozone, the UK’s large deficit remains a crucial economic vulnerability.
It remains a clear and present danger to stability.
Carrying on as we were means accepting that we spend even more on debt interest as a share of public spending.
Leaving things as they are for longer would mean higher debt, higher interest payments, and that means even bigger cuts in the long run.
Instead, we argue that we have to cut our cloth today to reflect our means, and show that we can be trusted to restore our public finances to health.
Building that trust has two elements: figures that people believe, and a plan that is being delivered.
The significance of the creation of the Office for Budget Responsibility is often underestimated in the UK debate.
Historically in the UK, politicians had been tempted to adjust their economic forecasts to suit their policies.
So when last autumn the OBR chose to substantially change its assessment of the damage done by the crisis, and so of the spare capacity in our economy, the government could not sweep this uncomfortable judgement under the carpet.
Instead, as I explained earlier, policy had to respond.
This is a structural shift that will shape Government for decades to come.
Never again will politicians be able to fiddle their forecasts in the face of the uncomfortable truth…
And never again will Government’s be able to spend the financial mirages these forecasts create.
It is also an example of the UK leading the way.
The existence of a strong, effective institutional framework is a significant strength for the UK compared to other countries, and the creation of the OBR has further enhanced that strength.
Many other countries are now seeking to emulate this change as they seek to rebuild their fiscal credibility
For instance, the European Commission has now proposed that Euro area Member States put in place an independent fiscal council to monitor the implementation of national fiscal rules.
At home, we set out in the 2010 Emergency Budget, the standard by which we would measure our success: the fiscal mandate.
Achieving a cyclically adjusted current balance by the end of the rolling five year forecast period.
And for debt to be falling as a share of GDP by the end of this Parliament.
As well as some tax increases, we set out a fixed envelope for public spending for the remaining four years of this Parliament. And in the spending review in 2010, we set out budget reductions by department.
In particular we focused on reducing welfare costs and wasteful spending, for instance…
Saving £18bn by 2014-15 through welfare and public sector pension reforms
£6bn through efficiency savings in 2010-11, and another £6bn by 2014-15 by cutting Whitehall by a third
£3.3bn through a two year freeze in public sector pay
And £1.5bn a year by 2014-15 by abolishing the Regional Development Agencies.
In all, Departmental budgets other than health and overseas aid were cut by 19 per cent.
These were tough decisions to make, but within these overall reductions, we were able to make some important positive choices for the country to promote growth, fairness and social mobility:
Protecting health and schools spending in real terms
Investing more in the life chances of disadvantaged children, and shifting education spending towards the early years
Investing more in transport infrastructure than our predecessors had managed in the previous 4 years
Reforming the welfare system
Getting defence spending under control
And we are already making good progress.
According to the OBR, in 2011-12, departments exceeded budget reductions, forecasting around £6bn of lower spending than planned.
By the end of 2011-12, almost 30 per cent of the spending reductions planned for the 2010 Spending Review period will have been achieved.
And the deficit in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, a key measure of fiscal sustainability, has been halved from its peak in the last two years, going from 7 per cent to 3½ per cent, and is forecast to approach zero by 2014-15.
The cyclically adjusted primary balance is a strong measure of the structural consolidation we need to deliver debt sustainability.
It excludes debt interest payments and the economic cycle on the deficit, and is widely used by international organisations to illustrate the underlying fiscal position.
It shows that we are on the right path.
But with 3 years to go, very difficult decisions remain to be implemented.
And while many departments have made significant changes, we need to do more to change the Whitehall spending culture for good.
We need to ensure that old habits that led to waste and unnecessary spending cannot re-emerge, and that new focus on getting better for less is permanently ingrained.
So today, I am setting some new and tougher rules around spending that the Treasury will be enforcing from this year on.
These are rules have been drawn up with finance directors from across Whitehall, and are designed to fundamentally change and improve financial management across all organisations spending public money.
Rules that demonstrate the collective determination of government to ensure that never again will our nation’s finances be allowed to get into such a mess.
From arms-length bodies, to Whitehall departments, to devolved administrations…we must all work together to play our part in improving financial performance.
There are three core elements to this more rigorous approach:
Improving our monitoring of spending…
Improving our management of spending…
And improving our oversight and scrutiny of spending.
Let me take monitoring first.
Delegated responsibility for spending cannot be an excuse to hide information, close the books, or weaken financial management.
For too long financial management in Government has been stifled by poor information sharing and poor incentives.
On the one hand, this Government has made huge strides to make more information available to the public as part of our drive for transparency.
But that same ambition has not been matched within our own walls.
That has to change.
From now on, all departments must monitor and share spending information with the Treasury on a monthly basis.
And that data must be consistent, allowing us to build a shared understanding of where the risks lie and how they are managed, as and when they arise.
Not months or years down the line.
Not when we’re trapped in the wrong track.
But in real time.
And improved monitoring will help change incentives on financial management.
The old system of financial management implicitly rewarded those who didn’t manage their finances.
In the end, when departments faced policy problems or where difficulties have emerged, they felt they could simply turn to the contingency reserve to bail them out.
We have to change those incentives.
That’s why in the spending review, we deliberately kept the reserve small in order to get the most money out to departments.
It means that departments have to be able to deal with problems that arise from within their own budgets.
Many departments already operate a small ‘unallocated provision’ in their annual budgets, to meet smaller pressures that arise.
And, under the new rules I have asked all departments to identify around 5% of their resource budget that could be re-prioritised if new pressures emerge or new policies have to be funded, so there is a shared understanding of how it could be paid for.
To be clear, no departmental budget is being changed as a result of this exercise. It is simply about good financial management, of the sort practised by families and businesses across this country.
And in future I will take performance in financial management into account when deciding whether to grant claims on the reserve.
That means punishing poor management, but it also means rewarding those with a record of good financial management with greater freedom over their budgets.
But that freedom comes with higher scrutiny. Where the Treasury has concerns that Accounting Officers may be falling short of fulfilling their responsibilities for managing public money, I will write to the Secretaries of State and the Head of the Civil Service to set our those concerns.
These new controls are not just a tweak to the Whitehall machine.
They are another signal of our unwavering determination to deliver the fiscal consolidation we promised.
It is this focus on delivery that is the cornerstone of our country’s credibility. Credibility, let us not forget, which is delivering the record low interest rates that are benefitting millions of families across the UK.
We have taken some very difficult decisions to restore this country’s financial credibility and economic prosperity.
The delivery of those commitments will be enhanced by the measures I have announced here today. And it will require further difficult decisions to be taken as this Parliament progresses.
Because we literally cannot afford not to change the way we do things.
Thank you.

Wera Hobhouse,United Kingdom,2020-05-21,"I wish to put on record my warmest thanks to all our doctors, nurses and care workers here in Bath, to the police and emergency services, key workers and council workers, and to everybody else who has helped us keep going during lockdown.
The covid pandemic has forced us all to change our lives in ways we would not have imagined only a few months ago. In all of the hardship and tragedy of this time, one of the brightest points has been the improvement in our air quality, because many fewer cars are on the road. As we have adjusted to lockdown, many people have commented that they have thought about the benefits of talking a walk or going for a bike ride, because it is much more relaxing and there is more time to reflect. Walking and cycling contribute greatly to our ​wellbeing. We have talked at length about social distancing measures and the space we need to give each other when we are socially distancing. In this country, safety has always been a barrier to cycling, but now, as our towns and cities are less congested, cycling has become a much safer option. Of course, we want to restart the economy as soon as it is safe to do so, but when we do we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to look at our streets with fresh eyes. We need to think about what did and did not work before lockdown, and at what we want to achieve as we put in place the conditions for a new normal.
For decades we have been overdependent on cars, and that must change. I have also spoken before about the need to tackle emissions from surface transport. We have been having these discussions in my city of Bath, which has suffered from severe air pollution, for many months now. As we slowly emerge from lockdown, we need to look at ways to avoid a dramatic resurgence in car use, particularly as many people may be nervous about using public transport. Other countries are already looking at ways to rebalance the priority given to cars over cyclists and pedestrians in urban areas, through segregated cycle lanes, speed reduction zones or new and widened pavements. I welcome the Transport Secretary’s new guidance to local authorities. Early action will be crucial, in order to embed changes in behaviour. This is a great moment for change, and we must ensure that our economic recovery is focused on the need to get to net zero.

Tim Loughton,United Kingdom,2016-01-23,"Thank you Debbie. It’s a great pleasure to join you today to discuss our plans for the year ahead and beyond.
But before I look forward, I want to look back and pay a few words of appreciation and acknowledgement to your teams.
In particular, I want to say thank you to the ADCS and its members for your thoughtful, positive engagement with government over the last year in business critical areas like fostering, adoption and social work reform.
Thanks to you, we are beginning to see significant progress in the implementation of Professor Munro’s child protection recommendations and real evidence of sector led improvement, particularly in terms of supporting and challenging councils.
This is important progress – in an exceptionally difficult economic context – so let me start by offering my warmest congratulations, and can I ask that you please pass on my appreciation to your teams around the country.
I would like to say a few words this morning about the work we need to do to speed up progress in child protection, focusing on the most vulnerable children in particular. But I am going to start by laying down some very substantial challenges for local areas in the year ahead.
Over the 12 months, I have witnessed some truly inspiring turnarounds in fortune for many of the most vulnerable children and families in this country: for which you must all take enormous credit.
Young people moved back into education after months, sometimes years of disengagement. Chaotic families supported to establish loving attachments. Children rescued from neglect and abuse by the extraordinary professionalism of social workers.
This is the very best of child protection work in this country – the very best example of what can be achieved with focus and ambition.
But I am also acutely aware of the fact that these successes do not excuse the very serious examples of service failures we have sometimes seen:
Young people transported across the country to live in care miles from family and friends and familiar environments. Teenage girls lured away from residential homes by gangs of men to be sexually exploited. Children waiting years for high quality adoption placements to take place.
These kind of failures ask all of us to take a long, hard look at the circumstances in which they occur, and keep occurring.
Where is the drive in weaker areas to reduce delays in adoption and fostering placements? Where are the basic safeguards against children being placed in unsafe, unsuitable accommodation? Why are we still failing to protect children in care from abusers: surely the most elementary of all expectations?
These are questions we all, and I do mean all, need to confront: from politicians to policy makers, DCSs to staff on the frontline. They are also the challenges I want you to now put at the top of your in-tray if they aren’t already.
In saying this, let me make the point that I know, as well as anyone, the utter commitment of everyone in this room to protect young people from danger; to secure the best results for them; and to deliver the very highest quality services. I also understand as well as anyone that we cannot guarantee the safety of every child in this country.
But as leaders, we need to be relentless in our ambition to improve safeguarding arrangements: continually to assess where we could do better, where we could reduce risk.
I want us to be able to look each other in the eye at these conferences and say: ‘yes we have done everything humanly possible to safeguard those children in our care’.
But to accomplish this, we must first be honest and transparent about performance levels. We must be rigorous in our commitment to self-assessment and improvement. We must work across the sector to encourage, challenge and support one another. We must ensure that the experience of the best is transferred to those who are not so strong, and make sure there is no scope for the denial of weak performance.
For our part, we will continue to do everything we can as a government to support you, to get safeguarding right and to strengthen public confidence. I talk about an approach of spreading best practice, not just finger wagging. Sending out letters of congratulation, not just scrutiny and intervention
Already this year, we have made significant progress to bring Professor Munro’s widely acclaimed report on child protection into practice.
We have shortlisted several exceptional candidates for the position of Chief Social Worker and will announce the successful candidate shortly. Eight local authorities are testing new approaches to child assessment. Ofsted has introduced its new inspection framework to provide a sharper focus on the quality and effectiveness of support for children.
We have also responded to your concerns over excessive government control by cutting back disempowering bureaucracy in areas like the Working Together guidance. The three draft documents we have published for consultation will replace over 700 pages of detailed instructions with just 68 – focusing on the essentials and leaving the details to you.
These are radical reforms aimed squarely at putting the power of decision making back in your hands.
My plea to you this morning is to embrace this power shift enthusiastically and energetically. Don’t wait for government pronouncements that are not going to arrive, take charge of the opportunity and press ahead with local reform.
To support you we have invested in the Children’s Improvement Board to work with councils across the country to develop a model of sector-led improvement that is based around rigorous, honest and open self assessment, peer challenge and sector based support.
This is not an insignificant commitment from government. We are providing seed funding of £8.85 million over this financial year to support CIB and we expect to see lead members, chief executives and yourselves leading us towards a more open, transparent, innovative and collaborative approach to self improvement.
I have been hugely encouraged to see you putting the structures in place that will allow every region to make a reality of sector led improvement.
What we need to see now though, is more impact across the country – with self-assessment, peer challenge and support used as a routine way of securing meaningful improvement.
In particular, I want to see much faster progress towards raising standards of residential care for young people.
On Tuesday, I wrote to you all outlining the urgent reforms we are taking to protect children in care from sexual exploitation as part of a wider overhaul of the system.
These measures include ensuring more robust checks are made before children are placed in care outside their home boroughs, and ordering the immediate lifting of all regulations that stop Ofsted telling police and other agencies the location of children’s homes.
On top of this, we are reviewing all aspects of the quality and effectiveness of children’s homes – including their management, ownership and staffing.
It is important to say that there are many exceptional children’s homes that keep vulnerable children safe, as well as helping them to thrive and succeed. Last month I met inspirational residential staff who had been nominated for awards by the children in their care.
I know there are many more professionals like these around this country, who work tirelessly and passionately to support children in care, and they deserve our unstinting praise and respect.
But it would be entirely wrong to pretend there are not significant challenges before us. You know, and I know, that there are residential homes in this country that are clearly failing their children in the most tragic of circumstances.
Sue Berelowitz underlined the scale of the problem earlier this week and I am enormously grateful to her for responding to us so quickly with the early findings into her ongoing report on child sexual exploitation in gangs and groups.
As you will have seen, her report finds a clear pattern of residential homes being specifically targeted by abusers where there is, in her words: ‘a constant flow of vulnerable children for perpetrators to exploit’.
We are working with Ofsted to make sure all care homes match up to the very highest standards and are properly assessed. I have also set up a multi-agency taskforce to address the inadequacy of data relating to children missing from care.
Most importantly, as many of you will know we published the Child Sexual Exploitation Action Plan last November, identifying several key stages where we needed better intervention on child sexual exploitation: including taking more effective multi-agency action.
We are already seeing signs of positive progress, with the LSCB chairs’ network helping to spread best practice. And I thank Sue Woolmore for her efforts on this and for helping to coordinate the efforts of individual LSCBs.
But I remain acutely concerned at the worrying trend for placing children in unsuitable residential accommodation miles away from the familiarity of home. Some 45 per cent of young people in care now live outside their home boroughs.
If you look at a heat map of our towns and cities showing the locations of residential homes and then transpose onto them the whereabouts of known child sex abusers, drug dealers and criminal activity, you will find that we are too often placing our most vulnerable children into the most dangerous areas of our country.
We should not imagine that the public easily accepts or forgets failures in child protection of this kind. Or of the kind we saw in the Rochdale case this year, where young girls were lured from care homes with the promise of cheap vodka or drugs, before being passed around ‘like balls’ in the words of one of the victims.
So, I want to make it absolutely clear today that we expect action to be taken immediately, and decisively, if there is any suggestion that care homes are not passing muster or providing excellence in safeguarding.
DCSs have a critical role to play in selecting the best care homes for individual children: do not think it is ok to send a child to a poorly run home miles away from your own authority – or to take an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ approach to child protection.
This is an issue we must all work together on, with total determination. And I want today’s conference to mark the start of an uncompromising focus by councils on improving standards in residential care for children.
These homes should not simply be protecting children from danger, they should be supporting them to achieve to the very best of their abilities: to succeed at GCSE; to succeed at A Level; to go on to University; and to secure meaningful employment.
I want residential homes, and their staff, to take their responsibilities to these children as seriously as you or I take our own role as parents.
They should set world class benchmarks for the care of our most vulnerable young people and hold themselves to the highest possible standards of delivery.
As you are by now well aware, the other, related, area where we want to see significant progress is in adoption.
At the NCAS conference in October, I made the point that there are councils doing a sterling job of improving the quality of their adoption metrics.
But we know the wider picture is mixed. Overall adoption figures fell again last year. Still only 74 per cent of children are being placed within 12 months of their adoption decision, and there is significant variation at local level.
The evidence shows overwhelmingly that delay has a negative impact on the life chances of children. It is imperative that stable homes are found within a reasonable time, and we are determined, as a government, to do all we can to speed up and streamline the adoption process.
In March, I wrote to you announcing the publication of the Adoption Action Plan. Last month, we published our adoption scorecards setting out performance thresholds and minimum expectations for timeliness.
On top of this, we are undertaking critical research in areas like adoption breakdown so we can fill data gaps, and we’re working to recruit a greater number and wider range of prospective adopters.
We know this is already having a positive impact, with greater attention and interest by councils producing substantial improvements in their adoption figures.
I would like to thank those authorities straightaway for their work but I also want encourage the others to will themselves on to do even better.
I ask you to treat adoption as a priority issue and to take it as a given that we will do anything, and everything we can to support you as you take action.
At the same time, I ask you to focus hard on fostering, where the challenge is just as significant, just as urgent.
According to the Fostering Network, a child comes into care every 22 minutes. Of all the children who come into care, 75 per cent are looked after by foster carers. To cope with demand, an estimated 8,750 new foster carers are needed across the UK in this year alone.
Foster carers are in an unrivalled position to build strong, stable relationships with the children they care for and to help a child address difficulties resulting from their experiences before entering care so they can turn their lives around.
That is why I launched the Foster Carers’ Charter last year, to give foster carers the recognition they deserve. I am delighted that 86 local authorities have already signed up to the Charter with a further 37 in the process of doing so.
The issue now is to make sure all fostering services sign up to, and implement the Charter so that all foster carers, whether they foster for local authorities or independent providers, receive the support, training and recognition that they need.
Finally, I want to build on my comments from last year’s conference and encourage everyone here to ensure they are using Positive for Youth to inspire high quality services for young people.
As some here will already know, we are publishing new guidance for local authorities shortly that will show the key role that services for young people have to play.
As I said at NCAS, we are going to provide you with the flexibility you need to design services and prioritise resources around local needs. In particular, the guidance will be shorter and sharper and it will be up to you to assess the sufficiency of the offer you make to young people.
We’ll also be taking stock of progress on positive for youth at the end of the year and pushing ahead with the inspirational National Citizen Service programme.
But I want to take this opportunity to say that I have been delighted to hear so many stories about the involvement of young people in local decision making, scrutiny of services and commissioning.
In particular, it is enormously encouraging to see so many positive examples emerging of councils working together across professions, legacy service structures, and radically redesigned local services.
I appreciate these efforts and do please keep on sharing your experiences of what works, and indeed what doesn’t, with colleagues around the country.
I know many of you are already doing this as a matter of routine so I want to end with sincere thanks to the ADCS.
I am aware that I have been challenging at times today. I do not, however, want you to imagine that I either underestimate or under appreciate the inspirational impact that you can have as DCSs.
I see the difference you make with my own eyes every day: not just in the reports that cross my desk and the conversations we hold across board tables, but in the work I see being done on the frontline by your teams.
Nor do I live in ignorance of the tremendous pressure that is placed on you from all angles, particularly in these tough economic times.
It is very difficult for those not directly involved to appreciate fully the extraordinarily fine judgements involved in child protection, and the pressure under which your staff are expected to deliver.
On a day-to-day basis, DCSs negotiate conflicting demands and situations of inordinate complexity, making the most far reaching of decisions. I want to assure you I never forget this contribution or take it for granted.
So, thank you and please take my challenge only as a signal of my very highest regard: the confidence I have in you to make a lasting difference to the most vulnerable young people in this country.

The Government of the United Kingdom stands with the people of South Sudan as they seek a future of stability and prosperity; one we hope of lasting peace with their neighbours, full integration into the region, and strong cooperation with Britain and other nations represented here today. We look forward to South Sudan taking its place as a full member of the United Nations.
We pay tribute to the enormous progress South Sudan has made since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement six and a half years ago. The 98% vote for secession in January’s referendum showed the unity of the people of South Sudan in their desire for self-government: today, that dream has become a reality. And we remember all those who died or were bereaved during the conflict. Their sacrifices should redouble the determination of all of us to support a peaceful future for South Sudan.
I commend all those in North and South who have been part of the painstaking negotiations that brought us to this point; and President Thabo Mbeki, the AU High Level Panel, the African Union and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development for their irreplaceable role in these efforts.
The people of the Republic of South Sudan and the Republic of Sudan now have a chance to coexist peacefully as neighbours and to settle their remaining differences.
We urge the leaders of both countries to maintain their commitment to the continuing negotiations, which are essential to building a lasting peace for all the peoples of both Sudans, and to lose no time in addressing the considerable challenges which still remain. They will have the support of the Britain and the international community as they do this.
To the people of the South Sudan, I say that the United Kingdom understands the challenges your new country will face. We will work with you as you face those challenges. As a demonstration of that support and our confidence in your future, we have today opened a new British Embassy in Juba and appointed the first British Ambassador to South Sudan, Dr Alastair McPhail. We will use this enhanced diplomatic presence to work alongside you as you build your nation and seek to meet the aspirations of your people.
And I also say to their neighbours in the north, the people of Sudan, that the United Kingdom wants to develop our relations with you and to help you too to build a better future.
Thank you very much, and happy Independence Day.

Munira Wilson,United Kingdom,2020-05-12,"History will judge us by how we treat the most vulnerable and poorest in our society during this pandemic. Today, the Office for National Statistics revealed that the lowest paid people are disproportionately more likely to die from covid, and among them, careworkers are twice as likely to die, compared with NHS workers. We know that there have been at least 6,600 deaths in care homes since the start of this pandemic, and it has become clear that the social care sector has been something of an afterthought in the Government’s pandemic planning. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that there is an epidemic in care homes, and we must not forget the hundreds of thousands of people who receive care in their own homes, some of whom will have died from covid and will be lost in the community statistics. We are talking about individuals of all ages who may be frail, have complex conditions, and significant needs. We are talking about staff who are often forced to work on the national minimum wage, and with zero-hours contracts and only statutory sick pay.
On 11 March I asked the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care whether he would be issuing personal protective equipment to social care workers, he said
“we are taking that into account”.
Staggeringly, it took until 15 April and thousands of deaths before he announced a plan to tackle coronavirus in the social care sector, including measures for getting PPE to providers. In the meantime, councils and providers struggled every day to get hold of it. With domiciliary care staff visiting many different households in a day, and residential care staff often working in more than one setting, that delay in getting vital equipment to the frontline has undoubtedly cost lives. What assurances can the Minister provide that all social care providers now have access to the protective equipment they need to keep their staff and clients safe?
It is welcome that provision has been expanded to ensure that all those working and residing in care homes are able to access testing. On 23 March, I raised in the House the dangers of discharging patients from hospitals into care homes without testing, but policy change came far too late. The long delay in access to testing enabled the virus to enter care homes with a lethal impact, spreading like wildfire. It has been reported that some care staff do not wish to take a test because they are concerned about the financial impact of taking time off work. Statutory sick pay is simply not enough to survive on, and it must be addressed urgently.​
We must not overlook the impact of the crisis on the wellbeing of care staff, many of whom are experiencing things they have never been trained for. Some fear that they are being blamed for the spread of the virus, and some that they may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder at a later date. What measures will be available to support their mental health?
It is right that we champion the NHS and, in the words of the Chancellor, give it “whatever it needs” to cope with coronavirus, but we must do the same for social care. We know that the extra funds granted to local authorities do not go anywhere near far enough. For too long, social care has been a poor relation to the NHS, and reform has been kicked into the long grass time and again. This crisis has brought into sharp relief just how important social care is in enabling the NHS to function well. It has also brought into sharp relief the many problems facing the sector. The covid crisis will precipitate many long-term changes in policy, and first and foremost among the areas for change must be social care.

Keir Starmer,United Kingdom,2016-12-14,"I would like to thank Bloomberg for hosting this speech today.
At this time of year, it is natural to reflect.
To look back on the year that has passed and to look forward to the year ahead.
Years that are so full of significance that the year itself becomes a shorthand for a set of events are rare.
But there can be no doubt that 2016 will go down as one of the truly defining years of the 21st century.
Two years ago today – on 13 December 2014 – I was in St Pancras Church opposite Euston Station.
I was speaking to hundreds of Labour Party members, having just been selected to succeed Frank Dobson as Labour’s candidate for my home constituency of Holborn &amp; St Pancras.
How different the world looked then.
Is it any wonder that we are still attempting to understand the world as it has now become and how we got to here?
But the real challenge is not just to interpret the past but to chart a path towards the future.
And that is my task for today.
Coming here to Bloomberg to deliver a speech on Britain and the European Union might be considered to be tempting fate.
When David Cameron spoke here in January 2013 he decided – as was so often the case – to put short-term political considerations ahead of the national interest.
My speech today will be guided by a different lodestar – our country’s interest.
I want to talk about how Labour should respond to Brexit in the national interest.
First, the context.
The Labour Party campaigned to stay in the EU.
I campaigned to stay in the EU.
The vote was to leave.
A high turnout.
A relatively close result.
But a clear result.
Yes, there were half-truths and untruths told in the campaign – none more egregious than the promise of £350 million a-week for our NHS that was daubed on the Vote Leave bus.
Yes, the tone of the referendum was deeply divisive, with social consequences that we all have a duty to tackle.
But we had a referendum and we have a clear result.
Had it gone the other way, those of us who passionately campaigned for Remain would have expected the result to be accepted and respected.
And that cuts both ways.
Now we face an uncertain future.
The first step is for the Prime Minister to distil the diverse and divergent views within her own party into a model of Brexit that can be negotiated with the EU.
I understand what a difficult position the Prime Minister is in.
Her predecessor, leading a government in which she served as Home Secretary, oversaw one of the greatest derelictions of duty of a British government in modern times.
The decision not to undertake any preparations whatsoever for a vote to leave has left the country without a plan and the government without direction.
The stakes could not be higher and the risks of getting this wrong should not be underestimated.
The Prime Minister must embark on the most difficult and complicated negotiations this country has undertaken since the end of the Second World War.
The outcome will determine not just our place in Europe but also our place in the world.
The role of the opposition is crucial.
This is not business as usual.
Setting out what Labour would do in 2020 does not suffice.
This is real opposition in real time.
By 2020, we will be living in a different world.
So how should Labour approach the task?
Some have argued that Labour should adopt the stance taken by the Liberal Democrats.
Frustrate the process: vote against the triggering of Article 50, block the road and somehow turn the clock back to 22 June this year.
Insofar as those advocating this course of action fear that in exiting the EU we risk becoming isolated, abandoning our values of tolerance and damaging our economy, I can understand the plea.
But it is the wrong response for three reasons.
First, as a matter of principle, no serious political party can claim to accept and respect the outcome of the referendum and in the next breath say that it will seek to prevent the Prime Minister from even starting the Article 50 negotiations.
A short point; but an important one.
Second, any political party with an ambition simply to frustrate the process cannot unify or heal the country.
Since I was appointed to my current role, I have travelled all over the UK – including to Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
I have met groups and individuals, held public events, talked to businesses large and small and discussed Brexit with different political parties and leaders.
From this, the evidence is clear: As a society we are more divided now than at any time in my life.
The divide is deep and, in some instances, it is bitter.
The surge in hate crime across the country and the reaction to the High Court judges who delivered judgment in the Article 50 case are testament to this.
In some London constituencies, 75% of those voting in the referendum voted to Remain.
Yet in other areas the precise opposite is the case.
Last Friday, I was in the Midlands, where in some areas 75% of those voting voted to leave.
A new fracture in politics has emerged.
And it is real.
The role of any responsible government ought to be to repair the breach.
Bring the country back together.
Unify.
But from the start, the Prime Minister has only had a message for one side of the divide.
The Conservative Party failed to act in the national interest by not planning for Brexit.
And this Conservative Prime Minister has set aside the national interest once again by serving the interests of just one side of the divide.
It is a double dereliction of duty.
Extrapolating the view of a group within the 52%, who were seriously concerned about freedom of movement and immigration, the Prime Minister has issued a ‘loud and clear’ warning that control over immigration will be prioritised over jobs, the economy and living standards.
I’m not going to shy away from the question of immigration, or to suggest that it was not a powerful factor in the referendum debate and outcome.
But by clinging to the discredited promise to get immigration into the tens of thousands, the Prime Minister is raising Brexit expectations which cannot be fulfilled without seriously harming our economy and public services.
Most reasonable people expect that the government should aim both for economic security and for the fair management of migration.
Not that it would sacrifice jobs and living standards to make arbitrary reductions in immigration.
Pursuing Brexit in the partisan interest might make Tory party management easier in the short run.
But as David Cameron could tell Theresa May: stray too far from the national interest, and you will be found out in the end.
The Prime Minister’s approach is also alienating the 48% of voters who voted to remain in the EU.
They feel increasingly despondent and despairing.
The government is treating them as if they voted themselves out of their own future.
They did no such thing.
And no party that proceeds against our economic interests in such a divisive way deserves to govern for long.
The government should be negotiating in the national interest, pulling the 52% and the 48% together, imagining and striving for a future that works for the 100%.
But those who advocate frustrating the Article 50 process are making the same mistake.
The Liberal Democrats hold out the false promise to the 48% of being able to frustrate the process.
But what have they got to say to the 52%?
Absolutely nothing.
How can their stance unify the country?
It can’t.
And Labour should not fall into the same trap.
A party that can only speak to and for half a nation cannot heal the rift in our society.
A party that can only speak to and for half a nation does not deserve to govern.
A party that can only speak to and for half a nation cannot forge a bold inclusive vision of the future capable of working for everyone.
The same is true of UKIP’s approach to Brexit.
Immediate withdrawal, without even bothering to negotiate a deal.
The hardest of hard Brexits.
Not only would this be deeply divisive – ignoring the 48% and many more besides – it would be disastrous for our economy, for jobs and for working class communities across the country.
That brings me to the third reason why Labour should not set its sights simply on frustrating the Article 50 process.
That is because to do so would mean walking away from the bigger battle that we must fight.
As we stand on the brink of profound change, it is clear that there are two versions of our future that could be negotiated.
The first is a future that tears us apart from our EU partners.
Standing outside and shut off from the European market of 500 million people who could buy our products and services.
Reverting to World Trade Organisation rules, which as the CBI have said “would do serious and lasting damage to the UK economy and those of our trading partners”.
A global race to the bottom which would not only put our economy and jobs at risk, but which would also abandon our shared scientific, educational and cultural endeavours with the EU.
So-called ‘Hard’ Brexit.
The second version of our future is a version where we exit the EU but build a new and strong relationship with our EU partners based on the principles of co-operation, collaboration and mutual benefit.
A future which preserves our ability to trade in goods and services with our biggest market of 500 million people.
A future that values joint scientific, educational and cultural work with our EU partners, and maintains our status as a global scientific superpower.
A future that guarantees our continued co-operation in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.
A future which allows the UK to retain its leading position in the world, influencing and contributing to developments across Europe and beyond.
The battle between these two versions of our future is the battle of our times.
It will be fought out over the next few years.
Labour needs to be leading that battle.
As the opposition, we need to be fighting the battle for the future of Britain.
If we do not, the chance to shape the future of our country will be lost.
Future generations will not forgive us for such a dereliction of duty.
But accepting and respecting the referendum result is not the end of the process; it is the beginning.
The referendum answered the question of what we should do, but provided no answer to how we should do so.
That question was not on the ballot paper on 23rd June.
It was not in the Conservative Party manifesto.
And it was not addressed by Theresa May before she became Prime Minister.
But it is the now the most pressing question Britain has faced for generations.
So what does fighting for the right version of our future entail?
Let me start with trade.
A good deal of ink has been spilt in the last few months on the finer distinctions of the single market and the customs union.
I’m not sure how much clarity that has provided.
So let me attempt to put Labour’s position succinctly by focussing on function not form.
Put simply, Labour will push for a Brexit model which maintains and protects our ability successfully to trade goods and deliver services with and to the EU.
That means:
A model that ensures continued tariff-free trade for UK businesses with the EU
A model that ensures that any new regulatory frameworks do not add bureaucratic burdens or risk harmful divergence from the EU market.
A model that protects the competitiveness of our services and manufacturing sectors; and
A model that ensures that existing protections at work provided by the EU are maintained.
These tests complement the aims set out by John McDonnell earlier this year and set a blueprint against which the government’s endeavours can be measured.
Significantly, the Government has provided far less clarity about its approach.
It has veered between a hard, extreme Brexit and some other undefined, vaguer form of Brexit.
The Prime Minister’s conference speech outlined the former: a UK out of any EU rules based systems altogether.
Necessarily isolated and detached.
When I visited Brussels shortly afterwards, it was clear this had been received by our EU colleagues as the Prime Minister wanting to take the UK out of the single market, out of the customs union and adopting the stance of a remote third party to the EU.
Hence the description, “Hard Brexit”.
Contrast that with the tone struck by the Business Secretary Greg Clark when he announced Nissan’s welcome investment in Sunderland.
We were told that the Government had given private assurances to Nissan that the UK would seek to achieve ‘continued access’ to the single market ‘without tariffs and without bureaucratic impediments’.
Amid those two very different visions of Brexit we have had a range of contradictory messages from Cabinet Members, as well as leaks, hints and Boris Johnson’s never ending running commentary.
Given the complexity of the issues before us and the deliberate lack of planning by the Cameron government, it is perhaps not surprising that we have this level of chaos and confusion.
But it needs to end now.
That is why Labour’s victory last week in securing a commitment from the government to publish a plan before invoking Article 50 was so important.
During the debate last week, I set out five tests for the plan to satisfy:
Does it end uncertainty surrounding the Government’s position on fundamental issues such the access to the single market, the customs union and transitional arrangements?
Does it include sufficient detail to allow the Brexit select committee and other relevant Parliamentary bodies to carry out their scrutiny functions effectively?
Does it enable the Office of Budget Responsibility to do its job properly in assessing the economic impact of Brexit?
Does it include sufficient detail to allow the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be assured that their particular and specific concerns are being addressed?
Will it help build a national consensus on Brexit?
A late vague plan will not do.
And I have put the government on notice that if no meaningful plan emerges, Labour will seek to amend any Article 50 Bill brought forward early next year.
Anyone who thinks that the government has been handed a blank cheque is very much mistaken.
Let me now turn to freedom of movement.
If Labour has the ambition to bring the 52% and the 48% together and to build a national consensus on Brexit, we have to recognise that changes to the way freedom of movement rules operate in the UK have to be part of the Brexit negotiations.
When I was Shadow Immigration Minister I spent months visiting every region of the UK to listen to views on immigration.
I know how important the issue is to many voters.
I know that any party that seeks to govern needs to listen to their concerns and come up with adequate and appropriate responses.
No comprehensive approach to Brexit or response to the referendum result can ignore the issue of freedom of movement.
As Len McCluskey recently said:
Labour needs a bold and ambitious response.
The rules must change.
And our new relationship with the EU will have to be one which is based on fair migration rules and the reasonable management of migration.
If Brexit forces us to confront the appalling and enduring skills gap in the UK, that is a good thing.
If Brexit forces us to confront low pay exploitation, that is also a good thing.
But the status quo is not an option.
Labour’s response must, of course, be driven by our values.
As President Obama recently said, the rapidly changing nature of:
“….politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration…in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe, or crude nationalism”.
The Labour Party and the wider Labour movement have always been at the forefront of fighting discrimination and building a fairer, more equal society.
Labour recognises that without the hard work and skill of migrants our public services, our businesses and our economy would suffer.
But we have also always been the party that values strong, cohesive communities.
It was striking that the referendum results showed the areas in the country with the highest levels of immigration voted most strongly to Remain.
But the areas with the highest pace of change voted most strongly to Leave.
That tells me that the British people are open and tolerant; but that they also expect change to be managed, rather than simply allowing the free market to rip through communities.
This is not to pretend that arguing for changes to freedom of movement will not make a deal on single market access harder.
It will.
But in the negotiations to come, it is incumbent on the government to fight for the fullest possible market access and reasonable management of migration.
We should demand nothing less.
But our new relationship with the EU has to go beyond an economic argument and protecting our ability to trade in goods and services – vital though they are.
Underpinning everything we have done with our European partners since the war have been shared values – British values.
As we forge a new future outside the EU, it is vital that we re-assert these values and use them to guide us through the turbulent times ahead.
Labour must argue for a bold, progressive domestic policy post-Brexit.
It is true – as many of us argued during the referendum campaign – that EU legislation has been a driver of progressive UK policy in areas such the environment, consumer rights and employment rights.
Protecting these gains is essential.
Particularly since some Conservative MPs have already signalled an intention to use the Great Repeal Bill as an opportunity to water down or erode these vital rights and standards.
But defending the status quo should never be the summit of Labour’s ambitions.
Enshrining rights in our law is important, but we should also pursue more progressive, more ambitious policies than those enshrined in EU law.
Not to match EU standards but to use Labour values to go beyond them.
And, in doing so, to seek to address some of the underlying causes of the division in our society.
So to conclude.
Many of the certainties and policy assumptions we have made for more than four decades are now up for grabs.
That is why the role of the opposition is so important right here; right now.
The future of Britain is being decided and Labour will be at the centre of it.
Respecting the result.
Fighting for a confident and outward looking country and a co-operative, collaborative and values-led version of our future.
Bringing a fractured country back together.
Responding to Brexit in the national interest.
That is Labour’s task.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-10-26,"Thank you. Beautiful.
Thank you, Pastor. A great, great honor.
And it's great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me, that's the issue of urban renewal, something you don't hear very much about, and the rebuilding of our inner cities.
Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class and to provide a new deal for black America. That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education and high-paying jobs.
My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign right from the beginning. And you've seen where we've come from and where we are right now. It's called America first.
Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first. I'm asking today for the honor of your vote and the privilege to represent you as your president.
And I will not let you down. You watch.
Here is the promise I make to you. Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country. But I will be your greatest champion.
Thank you.
I have no special interest. I take no orders from donors or lobbyists. I've put a lot money into this campaign, believe me. I'll be in for over a hundred million dollars, that's a lot. I work for you and I work only for you.
Our campaign is about change, optimism and the future. I'm asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future and our future together.
Our opponent represents the rigged system and the failed thinking of yesterday. Hillary Clinton's campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets and it's never going to get better. She's been doing this for 30 years and for 30 years it's only gotten worse. American politics is caught in a time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over and over.
And they keep coming back to the African-American community and the Hispanic community and they keep talking about what they're going to do and they don't do it. And then four years later, you see them again. It's enough.
They keep making the same mistakes and they keep offering the same, old, lame excuses when nothing happens. You know that, I know that. Frankly, everybody knows that. The fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement, we have a major movement, there's never been anything like it in this country.
And this is so important to me what I'm saying today. I wanted a small group of very, very powerful, influential people from the African-American community and that's what I wanted to do. Enough with the rallies of 25,000 and 30,000 people. This was very important to me.
And I just met with some of the finest people I've ever met, backstage. We had a great meeting. And I just want to thank those people right now. They are phenomenal people, so I want to say thank you very much.
But it's just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime. This is a movement that's once in a lifetime, never going to happen again, never going to have another opportunity. Every day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking and every day the same people getting rich off our broken system tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new because it's not good for them.
I have a message for all of the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics and not the critics.
And it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country. African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for our nation. They've fought and died in every war since the Revolution and from the pews and the picket lines they've lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rights.
Yet too many...
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yet too many African Americans have been left behind, massive numbers have been left behind. Forty-five percent of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not currently employed. African Americans comprise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make up 60 percent of murder victims under the age of 22. That's some number isn't it, though? Some number.
In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent and it's expected to rise to 24 percent this year. In Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January 1st of this year, that's not a very long time ago. Think of it, 3,500 people. The condition in our inner cities today are totally unacceptable and we have to fix them.
The Democrats have run our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years or more, uninterrupted. They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayors' office and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed and they've failed miserably. They've trapped children in failing government schools and oppose school choice at every single turn.
The Clintons gave us NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals in the history of any country.
It's taken our jobs, it's taken our companies, it's taken everything, so much out of our country. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that truly de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina where we are really focusing.
And by the way, you see the new polls coming out? We're really doing well, which is OK.
We really are. Thank you. We're going to win North Carolina, I tell you. We're going to win Florida, too.
Actually, we're going to win Florida, too. And we're going to win Ohio and we're going to win Iowa.
Yeah, we're winning a lot of states. They're getting a little worried back there, I'll tell you. The media, they're saying, what's going on over here? You have to see, in Florida they have lines that are four blocks long trying to get into the polling booths. They've never seen that.
And same thing in many other states that have started.
This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. Think of it, half. Decimating, by the way, and they have been decimated, decimating the African-American community and the African-American middle class, decimating. These jobs went to Mexico and other places.
Politicians -- Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and total violence. Then there's the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business and radical restrictions on American energy have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities and, in many cases, out of our country.
Hillary wants to raise taxes very, very substantially on everybody and on business and especially on small business, as high as 45 percent, which will only drive more jobs out of your community, out of our country and into other countries.
One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African Americans. That's what's been happening.
No group has been more economically harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge to enact open borders made in secret to a foreign bank -- WikiLeaks...
This WikiLeaks is unbelievable. What we've learned about her and her people, what they've said about her behind her back, but now it's not behind her back. She's got bad instincts according to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton has bad instincts. I wouldn't want my people saying those things. I wonder what they're saying.
Is there some way we can check it out.
No, they say terrible, terrible things about her. So, I mean, if they say that and they work with her all the time, why would we want her to be president.
At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what's happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and right here in North Carolina. You know that for a fact. It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
If I'm president and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they're moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a very, very simple call. I don't know if it's presidential, but I'd rather do it myself. And who cares.
Who cares.
Thank you. Very fun, very nice. He's screaming, Make that call! Make that call!"" Takes me five minutes
I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35 percent tax on their product, which in this case is small cars. You know, they're moving their small-car plants out of mostly Michigan, moving to Mexico. I mean, it's terrible. They're going to make their small cars. That's a big thing. It might be a small car, but it's a lot of business.
Before they ship it back to the United States, they're going to pay a tax, 35 percent. You tell them and you know what? They're going to stay. They're going to stay. They're not leaving. They're not leaving. But nobody ever says that. The politicians don't say that because they're getting campaign contributions from these people and their special interests, so they're not going to say that.
Me? I'm saying it. I'm doing what's right. I'm working for you, folks. We're going to get this thing right.
We're going to get it right.
Such a big problem. Our jobs are leaving us and people are being fired all over the country, our plants, our factories are leaving us. We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. Not going to happen. It's so easy.
When we stop offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home, meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable. At the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores.
You'll have jobs. You'll have jobs back.
It also includes a massive middle-class tax cut, tax-free child care savings account,s and child care tax deductions and credits, and a total simplification of the tax code.
I will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, a new tax incentive to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. And they will do that, it will be worthwhile. It's called incentive, they will do it.
I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties and the increased presence of law enforcement so we have safety in our community. We need that. We need that, the safety is important.
Some of our inner cities are more dangerous than some of the war zones that we're reading about and seeing about every night. We have to stop that.
I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. It's going to be beautiful.
Such talent, there's such a potential talent out there. It's so incredible and it's totally being wasted, wasted by politicians that maybe don't want to see it happen.
Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. You folks know that. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie, two friendly names, but they're not so friendly.
It's time for a 21st Glass-Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need. We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable, but forgivable microloans. Very simple, but something so good.
Then there's the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump administration. Safe.
Thank you, I love you, too.
Who is this.
No, I means so many people, so many people -- I mean, you walk to the store to buy a loaf of bread, maybe with your child, and you get shot or your child gets shot. Gotta stop it, no good, no good. We need safety.
I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African- American citizens about our justice system. And I promise that under a Trump administration, the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be no prejudice.
There will be only one set of rules, not a two-tiered system of justice like we have right now. You just see that with Hillary Clinton. I mean, think of it.
Think of it, she deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress and she has no trouble. And in your community, you know what you're going through, can you imagine if you did that? Can you imagine if I did that? I think they'd reinstitute the electric chair.
Forget about you, how about me? Would I be in trouble!
It is so unfair. It is so unfair that she's even allowed to run for the office of president.
And then you probably read, $675,000 went to the wife of the head of the FBI who was in charge of the investigation, to her campaign? No, no, is this too hard to believe? I mean, went to the head of the FBI's wife, who was in charge of the investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal. And then you wonder, gee, I wonder why she got off. That is a serious, horrible thing. Look, it's a horrible thing. It's not even believable. I have people, great, great lawyers, they can't even believe what's happening. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete her 33,000 e-mails and, especially after the subpoena from Congress, lie to Congress, like to the FBI, put our national security at grave risk, I mean, our national security was put at unbelievable risk with what she was doing, and not even face so much as a minor fine.
Now, think of it. A major general, a man, four-star general, that's about the top, General James Cartwright lied one time to the FBI. And he probably did it, he did it, in my opinion, for national security reasons, and he may go to jail for a five-year sentence. Think of it, five years, he may go to jail for five years. One time to the FBI; she lied looks like hundreds of times, hundreds.
Hey, how about she couldn't remember 39 times? Well, each one of those 39 was a lie, right.
Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama administration never held Wall Street accountable.
We will also police our streets, have to make our streets safe. I want every poor, African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace and not be scared and not be hurt.
The problem is not the presence of police, but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe, to keep us all safe. You know the murder rate in the United States, I don't know if you know this because the press never talks about it, is the highest it's been, think of this, in 45 years. Nobody knows that. The murder rate, highest it's been in 45 years.
I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods.
The reduction of crime is not merely a goal, it's a necessity for all of us. We will get it done. The war on police, urged on by my rival, is really reckless. What's happening is reckless and dangerous and puts African-American lives at risk. And all you have to do is look at the statistics and you see what's happening.
We must work with our police, not against them. We're going to work together and we're going to have an amazing relationship because, you know, everybody wants the same thing, we all really want the same thing.
Our immigration, that is, my policy on immigration is so simple. We will restore the civil rights of African American, Hispanic Americans and all Americans by ending illegal immigration. And yes, we will build the wall.
We will build the wall.
And we're going to stop the inflow, the massive inflow of drugs which is coming into your community more than any community, but coming into your community and poisoning our youth and poisoning many other people, but poisoning our youth. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs. And I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.
A portion of the massive amounts of money saved by enforcing our laws and suspending refugees will be reinvested in our inner cities. Don't forget, many of these refugees are coming from Syria and other parts of the world. We don't know where they're from, who they are, what their thought process is. And they're being let in by the thousands and thousands and thousands. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over what President Obama is allowing.
We don't know what's going to happen. This is the story of the Trojan horse. This is your second Trojan horse, guaranteed. And I can tell you right now it's not happening, not with me, it will be ended, it will be ended.
That will be ended. We have enough problems in our country. It's time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.
Infrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion in infrastructure investment of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary. We need something done. It's so bad. You look at your roads and you look at your everything, you look at your schools and hospitals, everything, it's so bad.
I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama/Clinton.
We're giving billions and billions of dollars away, we have no idea for what, and others aren't doing so much -- believe me, they are laughing, I'll tell you, that's what they're doing, they're laughing at us -- including all global warming payments to the United Nations, billions of dollars.
And listen to this. These steps will save $100 billion over eight years. And this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities. You see Flint, Michigan what's happened there, it's horrible. I was there and it is unbelievable, horrible, incompetent politicians doing the wrong thing.
School choice is at the center of my plan. Such a great thing.
And by the way, we're going to terminate Common Core and bring education local.
So important. Look, it's not working the way it is now. I don't know why anybody would even fight it. Well, we know who's fighting it. You know that.
My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice.
School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time. And I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. What a difference it will make.
I will also be establishing a commission which will include some of the tremendous people I met backstage today.
Raise your hands. I mean, you people were so -- thank you -- so great, some great ideas.
To tackle the school-to-prison pipeline and to shut that pipeline down and to create, so important, and to create a new pathway that leads from a great education instead to a great job. That's what we want.
It is, it's school to prison.
My plan will also ensure funding for historical black colleges and universities, more afford two and four-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.
You know, I've got to school with many people, some totally brilliant at one thing, but not at all brilliant at others. But we all know this. We've had students that sat next to us in class and they were terrible students, but they were phenomenal at fixing a car engine. They were phenomenal at fixing a television set.
They can take it apart blindfolded. And I can't do that. And you can't do that. But they were phenomenal at fixing things. We don't do that anymore. Remember, we used to have this great vocational education. They were talented, they were great. They were horrible students, and they were great, they can take a motor, they can take an engine apart blindfolded. And we have to bring that back. And that's what they love doing. That's what they love doing. And they'll do fantastically with it.
Don't you think, right? So true. So we're going to get that going again.
Finally today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty.
It's great. Nice to see, it's very nice to see.
That's something you'll never hear from Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you.
The promotion of family and support for the African-American church, it's been a tremendous power in this country for so many years. This is just the beginning because I will never ever take the African-American community for granted, never ever.
Unlike Hillary who does nothing, does nothing, for the Hispanics or for the African-American communities.
It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow.
The vicious cycle of poverty can be broken and great new things can happen for all of our people, great new things can happen. But to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites from Washington who have been wrong about virtually everything happening for decades.
Hey, they've been wrong about the wars. They've been wrong about jobs. They've been wrong about everything. And the question is, are they...
... are they stupid? The question is, are they stupid or do they have a plan? I actually think for the most part they have a plan, but some are not too smart.
And you're right about the swamp. Say it again.
Right? You better believe it. Boy, that is...
That is a -- you know, I said that about a week ago and I didn't like it that much, didn't sound that great. And the whole world picked it up.
So it shows you what I know. It's crazy.
Drain the swamp. We're going to drain the swamp of Washington. We're going to have fun doing it and we're all doing it together. And it is funny.
Funny how things like that happen. I was listening the other day to a great singer, great, one of the great legends, and said that, you know, so and so didn't like it, didn't like it, became one of the greatest hits of all time. So drain the swamp, I didn't like it, now I love it, right.
The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA and opening up our markets to China would bring a new era of jobs and prosperity. That didn't happen. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache and loss. The people opposing us are the same people who we've, and think of this, who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice, that have produced only more terrorism, more death, more suffering. Imagine if that money had been spent right here in our home.
We've totally destabilized the Middle East. And if you think about it, $6 trillion and it was far better 15 years ago. So we've made it worse. We've spent $6 trillion, lost thousands of lives, you could say hundreds of thousands of lives, because look at the other side also, so we've lost hundreds of thousands of lives and we're far worse off than we were when we started. Who are the people that do this?
And then we end the war in such a bad way that a vacuum is formed and we have ISIS. And that was the JV, the junior varsity, but now the JV is violent and vicious and ensconced in 32 different nations. And the one that gave us the JV now says how she's going to get rid of it. Not going to happen, folks. Just words, just words.
Just words. For 30 years she's been talking; for 30 years only bad things happened for her. She tried to build democracy in Libya and she failed. She tried to build democracy in Iraq and she failed. She tried regime change in Egypt and that was a disaster. She pressed regime change in Syria and that failed. She tried a Russian reset that was laughed at, laughed at. Putin has no respect for her whatsoever.
See, I'm not allowed to say it, but I'll accept it.
Who said that.
A star is born.
Now, if I said that I'd be in big trouble. She tried an Asia pivot and that failed. Now Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear- armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could very well lead us into World War III. For what? She doesn't get it. She doesn't understand. Remember, her top person says she has bad instincts, she's got bad instincts.
And by the way, we want to be so strong. We want to make our military so strong. We want to take care of our vets better than they've ever been taken care of.
Peace through strength. Peace through strength. We have no choice, these are very vicious times. This is not a time to have a depleted military. We're not going to have that. We have the greatest people in the world in the military. We're not going to have that, but we are going to take care of our vets also.
Finally, our opponents passed a health care law embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter and most politicians. I mean, they didn't want it other than he lied and lied, you can have your plan, you can have your doctor, 28 different times, and enough Democrats went over to that side. They made a mistake. Obamacare"" is now destroying our health care system. Premiums are skyrocketing double digits and are surging by more than 100 percent.""""inally
And think of it, in the great state of Arizona, I love Arizona, it's going up 118 percent. Oh, but don't worry, you're going to catch that, too, for sure. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie and I said it was going to be no good before it was ever passed.
If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare
Pennsylvania Avenue yet. But I'm very proud of it and I'm very proud of my children because we delivered it under budget and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction.
It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world and a great symbol for our country for many years to come.
I took two hours to fly into Washington to cut the ribbon with my children and then jump in the plane to be here with you, just did it.
I wanted to be there for my children who worked so hard on the hotel, they worked so hard, in particular Ivanka in this case. And I always feel this, I feel this so strongly. Parents must stick and encourage and support their children.
It would have been very bad. They work, work, work 24 hours a day, always working, and then you say I'm not going. It takes the heart out of them, right? Don't you think? I mean, they did a great job in the hotel and I told them so. And Hillary said Donald Trump took time off the campaign. Can you believe it? Here's a woman who goes home and she goes to sleep all the time. Think of it. Everyone's talking about the fact that I'll do seven, eight, nine stops, I'll make three or four major speeches. Like, for instance, right after this we have thousands and thousands of people in North Carolina coming to another one. Last night, 25,000 people. I got home at 1:00 in the morning. Here's a woman, she makes a speech for 15 minutes, she goes home, goes to bed.
Honestly, she has less energy than Jeb Bush.
I mean it! I mean it.
And the reason I bring him up, he didn't sign the pledge, so he's open game.
So he signed the pledge, right? But he didn't honor it. How do you live with yourself, you know? He signs the pledge and he doesn't live it. So we figure, but how do you like that? And then she has a speech today, she criticized me for going to the opening of this building which was in and out. It's not the way life works.
But I was also there for another reasons, the workers. They did a magnificent job. They were there.
And without them, it could never have been built so quickly or so beautifully. The rebuilding we did at the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country. We're going to rebuild our country.
I want to go into the inner cities, the poor, rural communities and the failing schools and I want to work on a national plan for total revitalization. We're going to be so proud of our country again.
I'm tired of the excuses from our lame politicians. I'm tired of being told that it can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams for another day, but they really mean for many decades.
Enough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we cannot accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside of our reach. Everywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. And maybe the greatest of that potential is in the African-American communities.
There's so much potential. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and time again. We have to choose the more optimistic path. We have to choose to believe not in our politicians, not in these people that got us there, but to believe in ourselves and the future of our country. If we do that, anything is possible.
So I'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone, especially now, especially for our African-American communities.
And that's going to happen.
I am very humbled beyond words to be the nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people don't know that, it's the party of Abraham Lincoln.
And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home in the future and forever more for African Americans and the African-American vote because I will produce and I will get others to produce and we know for a fact it doesn't work with the Democrats and it certainly isn't going to work with Hillary.
Together, we will have a government of, by and for the people.
And we will make America great again for all Americans. Thank you very much and God bless you everybody. A great honor to be here, thank you. God bless you. What an honor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you all.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-01-09,"This is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and nobody appreciates you more than the President of the United States. Everybody knows what you do, and everybody cares.
Without you, it just couldn't be the same. It would be really bad. So, again, thank you and have a great Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.
",Donald Trump Vlog: Law Enforcement Appreciation Day,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-vlog-law-enforcement-appreciation-day-january-9-2020
Nick Herbert,United Kingdom,2019-11-06,"Thank you for calling me to speak, Madam Deputy Speaker, and commiserations on yesterday—I congratulate the new Speaker. I apologise for being unable to be here at the start of the debate. I had not intended to speak, but I decided only last night to stand down as the Member of Parliament for Arundel and South Downs, the constituency that I have been honoured to represent for nearly 15 years.
It was a pleasure to listen to the speech of my right hon. Some 33 years ago, while working as a ​young researcher, I helped a young candidate who was standing in a by-election in West Derbyshire. I claim that the 100 votes that my right hon. Friend secured to win the seat were won by me, and he claims that he would have won handsomely had it not been for my disastrous research.
I went on to stand for Berwick-upon-Tweed in north Northumberland. Unfortunately, that was in 1997, the year of Armageddon. My efforts in that beautiful rural constituency were not helped early on when I opened a coffee morning with a speech urging everyone to vote Conservative, only to be told that I was in fact at a meeting of the Methodists. I could not have been expected to know that that particular village had two village halls, but I learnt an important lesson about knowing your constituency.
I was immensely privileged to be chosen at the very last moment to stand for Arundel and South Downs for the Conservatives, and I believe that someone else will be very lucky indeed to be chosen at the very last minute to stand for what I believe is the best constituency in the country, full of the most wonderful people and strong communities. I will miss it a very great deal. I fought four general elections and my majority has gone up every time to a record level, and I know that it is smart to quit while ahead.
I made my maiden speech in a debate on rural issues. I spoke last in that debate, too, and nobody told me that I was permitted to go to what the Americans call the restroom while waiting to make my speech. I waited for what seemed to be hours, absolutely desperate for it, and then made the shortest maiden speech in history as a consequence.
I then went to see the Whips to explain that it was very important for the new Member of Parliament for Arundel and South Downs to watch Australia play the Duke of Norfolk’s XI at the Arundel castle cricket ground. The Whips told me that not only was that entirely possible, but I should submit any request, at any time, for any sporting event that I felt I needed to attend. I had no idea that they were being sarcastic and so proceeded to give them a long list of all the sporting events I wished to attend that year. I have never lived it down.
I soon found myself on the Front Bench and, for a very brief time—this is a salutary lesson for all the young people who will enter the House after the election—was billed as a rising star. I then plummeted into the depths of the Home Office, a fall from which I never entirely recovered.
I agree with my right hon. I am not entirely certain that everyone would be effusive enough, so I intend to list some of the things that I have been involved in—my serious point is that I intend to continue working in a number of important areas that I have worked on in this place. They include LGBT rights, which my friend the hon.​
I also set up the all-party parliamentary group on global tuberculosis, to help fight the world’s deadliest disease. The Global TB Caucus has succeeded in driving TB up the agenda, with a high-level meeting at the United Nations. It is ably led by Sarah Kirk, with support on the APPG from Janika Hauser, and it was set up with brilliant initial work by my friend Matt Oliver.
I have recently assumed the chairmanship of the Countryside Alliance, which I intend to devote a lot of time to, returning to my roots, because I believe passionately in supporting rural communities, in the freedom to choose and in ensuring that we protect the rural way of life. I will be running the think-tank that I have set up, the Project for Modern Democracy, just as I previously set up the think-tank Reform, because I believe we need new thinking on Whitehall reform, planning and how we ensure markets operate fairly in the modern world.
I just want to say something briefly about Brexit. I set up the national no campaign against joining the euro. For a long time I was thought of as a Eurosceptic, but I led the Conservatives In campaign to remain in the European Union. Nevertheless, I accepted the result of the referendum immediately. I want to dispute the idea that the only principled position for remainers to take is somehow to gainsay the referendum result. I do not believe that that is true. Actually, I think it is a principled and honourable position to accept the result of the referendum, because in the end it is about democracy. I have done that, which is why I support the Prime Minister in successfully seeking a deal. I do not think that we should demonise the millions of people who voted for remain, but have accepted the result and think a deal is possible. Rather, we should investigate more closely why people voted for leave and what exactly they wanted, and have a more mature, sober and sensible debate on those issues.
Finally, I would like to thank my brilliant staff: Michelle Taylor, my wonderful constituency assistant; Alex Black, who runs my office; Lynsey White, my wonderful secretary; and Chris Cook, my researcher. I would like to thank members of my Conservative association and my chairmen, Angela Litchfield, Sue Holland, Malcolm Gill and Peter Griffiths. I thank my constituents for doing me the great honour of returning me to Arundel and South Downs. Above all, I thank my partner, my closest and best friend, Jason Eades, without whose tireless and unquestioning support I would never have been able to do this job in the first place. Thank you all for doing me this great honour. I am very sad to be going, but I know it is the right time to do so.
",2019 Valediction Speech,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/nick-herbert-2019-valediction-speech/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-03-13,"We love Boca. We love Florida. Beautiful. Great to be with you tonight. This is incredible. It's not too far. This is my second home. I love Florida. And I hear my man, Steve, did a beautiful job explaining what a lousy senator you have. Is that right? He did a great. Tell you, Marco doesn't vote. You got to go vote.
You know, interesting, you get elected to the Senate, you got to go vote on occasion, right? He set a record, one of the worst records in the last 10 years for no voting in the Senate. So we don't have to go into it too big. But you know what's gonna happen? We're gonna make America great again, folks. We're gonna make America great again.
So we had an interesting week. On Friday, we went to Chicago. We had 25,000 people coming. No, it's OK. We had 25,000 people coming. We had some, I would say, they were, let's be nice, protesters, OK? Let's say, let's call them protesters. And we had a decision to make. We had to make this decision. We want peace.
We want happiness. We want everybody to go home really happy, really peaceful. So we said you know what we'll do? We'll postpone it. And it was a very wise decision. We've been given a lot of credit. And we've been given really a lot of credit. And you know what? It was an amazing thing.
And they're talking about us and they're talking about how well we handled it. And they're talking about the fact that nobody got hurt. Nobody got injured. Everything went smooth. It was a nice easy breakup. So that's the way we have to have things go. And I love you people for being here tonight. Thank you.
So -- I love you too. It's a guy. It's a guy, but I love you. I love you. So this all began around June. But around January I said, I have to start thinking about it. Too many mistakes are being made by the politicians. Too many mistakes are being made by people that truly don't know what they're doing. And we can't have it anymore, folks.
We can't have it anymore. Our trade deals are the worst anyone's ever seen anywhere in the world. You go anywhere in the world, we're like the lapdog for the world. We're like the people that don't know what they're doing. We're not gonna take it. What happens is China this year going to make $500 billion in terms of trade deficit.
Can't have it. Mexico, $58 billion. Think of it, China, China 58 -- China -- Mexico, $58 billion. China, $505 billion in a trade deficit. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. So what's going to happen is we've got the greatest negotiators in the world. Carl Icahn, all of them, they're calling me. They all want to be involved.
We're gonna negotiate the greatest trade deals you've ever seen. We're gonna turn it around. We're gonna turn it around fast. We are gonna become rich again. We're gonna become great again. We're gonna take care of Social Security. We're gonna take care of Medicaid and Medicare. We're gonna take care of all of the things that frankly, right now, we can't do, OK? We can't do. So we're gonna take care of it. Now when it started I was coming down the escalator in Manhattan.
And when it started, it was about the border and it was about trade. The border is a disaster. Drugs are pouring across. Crime is pouring across. We've got to strengthen our border. If you don't have a border, we don't have a country. Is that right? Oh, we love that wall, don't we? Oh, we love that wall.
That wall is gonna happen, folks. Do you remember when I first brought up the wall? Everybody, all of these people -- first of all, they're all controlled by their special interests. They're all controlled, every single one of them, they're controlled by their lobbyists. I know the politicians better than anybody knows the politicians.
I've dealt with them all my life. If you can make it with a politician, you can't make it at all folks, OK? So they're all controlled. I'm self funding my campaign. I'm not controlled. I don't have anybody's money. Nobody is gonna tell us what to do. I'm working for you and I'm working for you. I'm working for you, folks.
Believe me. So it began and we started talking about trade. Now trade, we understand and trade, you know when they do polls, on trade, on the economy, on finance, on leadership, on all of this stuff, we lead by so much. I lead by so much. The personality -- and they don't love it so much but that's OK. Who cares?
Who cares? Who the hell cares about that? We want it. We got to straight down our country. But I'll tell you, you want to know the truth? I'm a better person than the people I'm running against, that I can tell you. And I'm a better person than Hillary. Hillary is not good. So -- thank you. You know, I tell you, a little while ago, a friend of mine said to me, how many people are you gonna be speaking in front?
He's down in Florida, very successful guy, very wealthy guy. In fact, maybe I'll use him to negotiate against Japan, OK? Believe me. Believe me. All you have to do is go home, relax. This guy makes -- he only makes good deals. So what happens, what happens, he said, how many people are you speaking in front of? I said, maybe about 12,000, 15,000. He said, how do you do that?
I said, you know, honestly, and by the way, no teleprompters, right? No teleprompters. No teleprompters. I saw Hillary last week, it was outside, there were two teleprompters. They were massive. They were so big and they were painted black on both sides. They were painted black, so you couldn't even see her.
And I said, what are we doing? No teleprompter. Do you notice I'm not reading speeches. No reading speeches. No reading speeches. Speak from the heart and from the head, but speak from the heart. We got to do it. We got to do it. We speak from the heart and from the head. I mean, you know, let's not forget that.
But we've got to do it. So look, I love this group. This is a good group. Go ahead. USA. USA. Man, what spirit. Look, how young some of these people are too. Look at them, young, young, young and beautiful and wonderful and great heart and great everything. Unbelievable. I'm telling you and I told this guy, I said, there's so much love in that place.
There's -- and this is, by the way, we have a movement going on, folks. This isn't just us here. This is all over the country. Same thing is happening. Same thing is happening. So remember, and I guess you've been seeing it, cover of Time Magazine many, many times, cover of everything. The biggest political story in the world today are the millions and millions of additional people far more, far more than four years ago.
Not even a contest, up by 70%. Some states up by a 102%. And I love that sign. It says, Hispanics for Trump. I love that sign. Thank you. I love you. You know, they do the polls, the exit polls and I always win with Hispanics, which nobody understand. But you understand it because we're gonna bring jobs to the United States.
And when you're here legally, other people aren't gonna be taking your jobs, right? So they understand it. But you know, the exit polls, you come out, I win with women. I win with men. I love the women. I do love the women. I win, I win with women. I win with men. We win with the military. We win with the vets.
We win with young. We win with old. We win with highly educated and we win with less than highly educated and we love them. We won with every single category, everybody. So the point is we have a massive situation going on. And honestly, it's the biggest story in politics. The biggest story -- worldwide, the biggest single story in politics.
The unbelievable amount of people that are coming out and voting. And you saw it in New Hampshire. You saw it in South Carolina. We won all of them. We won so many of them. I have a list. You know, it's interesting, lying Ted Cruz comes in with a Bible. Ladies and gentleman, lying Ted. Lying, l, y, i, n, '. We can say it the right way.
We got to go, lying Ted. And he comes in with the Bible, right? And he lifts the Bible. And by the way, I win with the evangelicals by a lot because they know I'm legit. But lying Ted comes in with the Bible, he raises the Bible, he puts the Bible down and then he starts lying. So it's lying Ted. Actually, you know, little little Marco what we did -- No, no, no. Now, he's a little, l, i, d, d. Little Marco.
You know, we have to you have to brand people a certain way when they're your opponents. Like Jeb Bush, we call them low energy, low energy. You know, the first time I saw Jeb -- and I don't care talking badly about him. He spent $29 million on negative ads on me. $29 million, can you believe it? He spent a lot of people's money, of his lobbyist and his special interest money.
But you've got a brand people. We brand it. So we started off 17 people up on this stage and what the hell did I know about this stuff. I've never done this before, right? So we start off with 17 people. Now we're down to four. Bush was favored, then Walker was favored, then another one was favored. They're all favored.
Now Trump is favored, OK? It's about time. They haven't learned. So you know, when I was thinking about running, it was really interesting because some of these pundits are not worth anything. These guys at the worst. They say, well, he's not going to run. He's just having fun. He's just having fun. I know he's not running.
There's no way he'll run. Don't worry about it. One guy said, he's just a clown, a clown. Me? I'm a clown. I build a great business, the best business. Nobody has ever run for president did what I did in terms of business and things. We put in papers at federal election, the likes of which has never been seen down there.
We built an unbelievable company, with very low debt. The greatest assets. By the way, speaking of Florida in terms of assets, Doral, right? We love Doral, in Miami, hundreds of acres owned by Donald Trump. So what happens -- and the reason I say, it's some of the greatest assets in the world, low debt, great cash flow.
The reason -- and I filed. Somebody said, oh maybe he won't file because maybe he's not worth as much as they thought. Actually, one of my very successful friends said, now I know how successful you are. Now I know, how rich you are because you filed. I mean you had to file the most detailed papers. And I said, look, it all doesn't matter.
Here's what does matter. We need that kind of thinking to bring our country back where we pay off our debt, where we balance out. We need a certain, we need a certain thinking. So the pundits all said, oh, he'll never run. He's just having a good time. Somebody said, he's doing it for branding. I'm doing this for branding.
I can think of other things believe me other than -- I love you folks. But I can think of places I'd rather be, right? We can think of places we'd rather be. So what happens, so what happens, they said, well, he's just -- now I watched them tonight and they are the same guys. He's not gonna run. Don't worry about him.
You know, they're also cocky. Now they're saying, how do we stop him? What's going on? What's going on? How do we stop him? You know, no, it was very funny. I mean, these people are the worst. They're the worst. Let's see them run for office someday. They wouldn't have a shot at it. And one of them actually said, now one of them actually said, this is the most talented politician I've ever seen.
I said, I don't want to be called a politician. But it's very interesting. So they said, how do we stop him? How do we do it? How do we do it? And Jeb actually said, I don't know if he can be stopped. He's a gifted, gifted politician. And my wife said, let me ask you a question, this was a month ago before he dropped out.
They said, let me ask you this question, darling. Why did he call you a gifted person? You're a gifted person if he's fighting you? Now, do you know why he called me a gifted person? I will not say because he's stupid, OK? I'm not gonna say that. Why? Why? You know why? Because we're gonna do things that have never been done.
We're gonna straighten our country out. We're gonna do it fast. It's gonna be done properly. We're gonna strengthen our military. We're gonna knock the hell out of ISIS. We have to do it. We have to do it. They're chopping off heads. They're drowning people. You know, you probably saw it during one of the debates.
By the way, who won the last debate? Could I ask you? You know, I'm against these guys. They're politicians. All they do is debate. Their whole life is to debate. And Ted Cruz is a good debater. I said, he's a good debater but he can't talk properly. It's true, right? He's a bad talker. Good debater. But you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna go one by one, we're gonna go step by step and we're gonna solve our problems and we're gonna solve them fast.
And a woman came up to me because I explained we're the policemen for the world. We're spending a fortune on Germany. We're spending a fortune on South Korea. We're spending a fortune in Japan. You know, we guard Japan. Now if something happens to us, Japan doesn't have to help. If somebody attacks Japan, we're in World War 3 folks.
I hate to tell you, OK? Germany, we take care of Germany. Now Germany is an economic behemoth. They don't pay us very much. We lose on everything. We don't win anymore folks. We're gonna start winning like you've never seen anything win before. We have all the cards. We have the cards. So here's the story and I tell it, and I tell it strongly because I just feel that we have to be -- we have to at least -- we like to help people, right?
We all want to help people. But, but it's got to be fair. Now, with all of these countries we're spending money somebody said, our military budget is 10 times higher than anybody else's, but that's because we're taking care of the world. Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, before the oil went down, now they're still a billion dollars a day and we protect Saudi Arabia.
They pay us peanuts. Not gonna happen anymore, folks. We're now gonna be, we're now gonna be back in the saddle. We're gonna be running it the way it's supposed to be run. You are going to be so happy. You are going to be so proud of your country again. You're gonna be proud of your president, but you have to get out and vote on Tuesday.
You have to do it. Now a big, big thing is gonna be is going to be -- so we're rebuilding our military. By the way, we're rebuilding our military. We're gonna have the finest and you know, what we're gonna do? We're gonna get the equipment that they want, not equipment that's sold to the armed forces because that particular company, even though they don't want it, has better political connections with the guys that I'm running against, OK? We're not doing that anymore.
We're getting the right stuff. We're getting this stuff. How often have you seen that we're stuffed, they stuff it down your throat. Equipment that the soldiers and the generals don't want because a company is politically connected. No more folks. Not gonna happen. Not gonna happen. Now here's what we have to do. And it all changed because something changed and it was very big.
But here's what we're gonna have to do. So important. We are gonna do new trade deals. We had a company and you saw just the other day, a couple of weeks ago, Carrier said, we're moving out of the United States. We're moving to Mexico. I made a speech, I made a speech yesterday in Cleveland. And in Cleveland, where by the way, the governor is raising real estate taxes through the roof.
He approved NAFTA. He's now approving TPP, which is gonna be worse than NAFTA. I'll tell you what, if we can't beat Kasich, we have ourselves -- I really think we are going to do great, not only in Florida -- and let's not say that we have a 21 point lead because I want you to vote. Let's assume we're even, OK? Somebody came out they said, Mr. Trump, congratulations.
In Florida, you have a 21 point lead over a no show senator, over a senator that doesn't work. What does he do? What does he do? So I said, do me a favor. Let's not tell the crowd that we have a big lead. Let's tell the crowd, well, we can never lie, but let's say it's tight. It's sort of tight. We want you to get out and vote.
But remember this, in Ohio, in Ohio, it's pretty even with Kasich. And people don't understand what's been happening in Ohio. They've lost a tremendous amount of their business. I went to Cleveland yesterday, I made a speech in front of a massive, like a massive crowd and they were saying, Eaton left. They're over there.
I mean, I'm right in this big convention center owned by the great Patrick Park and his family, great people. But they said, Eaton left. They're on the right. Ford left. I said, let me guess, where did they move? They said, Mexico. Mexico. Nabisco left for Mexico. Look, look, folks, the reason we have this whole thing going.
The reason -- and I mean it. I was starting to say before, this is a massive movement. This is not -- they say, these people, most dishonest people, look at all those people back there. Look at all those cameras there. Look at all those cameras. And unless we have a protestor, the cameras are never gonna show the crowd.
Do we have a protestor or anyone? Do we have a disrupter? Because unless we have a disruptor, I don't even call them protestor. I call disrupters. Unless, we have a disrupter, the camera never goes off my face. They're all live. They never go off my face. Is there a disrupter in the house, right? So here's the story, look.
So in Cleveland, I looked and you look at the business being drained out of Ohio. I mean every place, not every place. A lot of it's going to Mexico. Pfizer, the great pharmaceutical company, did you see what they're doing? They're leaving. They're going to Ireland. So here's what we're gonna do, let's use Carrier as an example.
Now my daughter Ivanka. Did anyone ever hear of Ivanka? Huh? And my wife, Melania. They want me, they want me to be presidential. So they said on the last debate, darling, we love you. My daughter said, Daddy, just be low key. If they say bad things, you don't do too much. I said, I can't do that. My wife said, be presidential and it was good.
I sort of like the other way better to be honest with you. I mean, I'll be honest. You know, they want me to be put. But here's the thing what I'll do, I'll do this even if it's not very president because you're president. OK, let's say, we win. Great. We win as president. So now, what I do is the following.
I call up Carrier. And you know, I'm a conservative person and I'm very conservative on military and taking care of the vets. And we're gonna get rid of Common Core. And we're gonna have strong borders and yes, we're gonna have the wall.
And yes, Mexico is gonna pay for the wall, 100%. But here's what they say, some of the conservative guys who aren't really too smart. You know, this National Review Group, they had 18 guys write a negative piece about me. And after that, my poll numbers went up seven points, OK? Do you believe? So they say, National Review, but they say, he's not a free trader.
Well, who wants to free trade if China is making -- if we have an imbalance with China of $500 billion a year. We don't need to free trade for that, folks. Mexico, the reason Mexico is paying for the wall is very simple. The wall is not big, OK? We have, as you know, in China, the great -- we all studied, right?
The Great Wall of China. It's 13,000 miles long. It was built two thousand years ago. Look at that sign, it says, build the wall. We're gonna build the wall. Don't worry about it. 100%. By the way, 100%. 100%. So our wall. We need a thousand miles because we have a lot of natural barriers and a lot of things.
It's actually 2,000. But we need a thousand. And by the way, just so you understand, I love the Mexican people. I love the Hispanic people. So many work for me. I deal with them in business and everything else. They're great people. The problem is their leaders are far too smart for our leaders. Our leaders don't have a clue.
So here's the story. Everyone said and a couple of these guys came off the stage that we were competing with their gun. But they came off the stage and they said, you can't get Mexico to pay for the wall. I said, here's the story. We have, we have trade imbalance. Think of it, $58 billion. The wall is gonna cost $10 billion.
How easy is that, folks? You get it, right? You get it. It's peanuts and we subsidize that. We do so many things for Mexico and Mexico is gonna be fine. You know, we are going to have better relationships with these countries. Look at Mexico, remember Sergeant Tambores? He was there for so long. The president probably never even lifted up a phone.
I mean, the answer is I don't think he did. And he was there far longer. He got lost and he shouldn't have been there and he got there. And that kind of stuff that's not a good neighbor policy. The way they treated him. That's not a good neighbor policy. And then you look at China, in the South China Sea, they are building a massive military base with runways and storage of weapons and all sorts of things.
Now, they don't respect us. They're not supposed to be doing that. They're not supposed to be doing it. So we're gonna have -- let me tell you, this is the way it works. We're gonna have economic good relations with these countries. We're gonna make a lot. We're gonna bring a lot of jobs back into the United States.
And we're gonna actually have better relationships than we have right now because they're gonna respect us. Right now, they don't respect us? OK. So here's what happens. So here's what happens with Carrier. It's very simple. I want to do it myself. May I do it myself, please? OK? Even though Melania and Ivanka said, please be presidential.
Because somehow it's not very presidential for the president of the United States to be calling up Carrier air conditioning company. I buy a lot of Carrier air conditioners. I'm not buying them anymore. So here's the story. We have to be proud. Remember we used to have signs made in the USA, right? And we were proud.
When was the last time you saw that sign? You don't see them anymore, right? And you know countries like Japan and I respect this. I respect this. By the way, I'm not angry at China and I'm not angry at Japan. So fast. I've never seen anything.
I was at the docks. I'd never seen massive boats coming right out of Japan. Now, you know, what we give them? Practically nothing. It's a one way street. It's a one way street. We have all the power. We have to be able to use the power and sparingly and we don't want to hurt anybody and we don't want to hurt other countries economically.
We're getting got to get along great with other countries. But we can't be the stupid people anymore, folks. We can't afford to lose the kind of of money and jobs. The jobs are being sucked out of them. Sucked right out.
I won Michigan in a landslide because they know I'm gonna bring the jobs, gonna bring the industry back. We're not gonna have this stuff anymore. So here's what I have to tell. So maybe I'll have one of my guys too because it's a little more presidential. I'll have one of my genius negotiators do it. But I love doing it and it's so easy.
I'm gonna call up the head of Carrier. I'm gonna say, listen, listen, here's the story. What you've done is very sad. I saw them. They let 1,400 people go. Not gonna happen. Not gonna happen. So here's what I'll tell them. I hope you enjoy your new plant in Mexico. I hope you have great success and I hope it's a really beautiful building.
But here's the story, every single time you sell an air conditioning unit crossing our now strong border, where they can't just take them come across anymore. Every single time, we are going to have a tax on that unit of 35%, OK? 35%. And by the way, I'll tell the same thing to Ford and I'll tell the same thing to Nabisco.
And all of these companies that are going crazy and they're moving out and they're letting go of people here and they're opening up new. So here's the story and here's what's gonna happen 100% as sure as you're standing there. Here's what's gonna happen. They're gonna call lobbyists, but I can't be taken by lobbyist because I didn't take their money.
They're gonna call special interests. They're gonna call donors. They're gonna call everybody. It doesn't matter. Let let me just tell you. Anybody else, any other politician, 100%. But here's what happens. I will tell them, you're gonna move back, right? And they're gonna say, yes, sir. We're moving back to the United States.
We're gonna build our factory in the United States. We're not moving to Mexico and we're gonna create a lot of new employment. And that's what's gonna happen. That is what is going to happen. And you know what? Unless we do that -- now somebody from the conservative movement, I always say, commonsense conservative, right?
Somebody -- Hello, Darling. How beautiful she is. Somebody from the conservative movement would say, Donald Trump is not a free trader. I am a total free trader. But to have free trade, we need smart leadership. We do not have smart leadership. We'll probably have free trade because once I start telling these people that are abusing us with their monetary manipulations.
And by the way China, they're like your grand chess player. What they do to us with devaluation of their currency is beyond belief. Grand chess masters. But I get the game and a couple of other people get the game. Our president has no clue. We're gonna change it, we're gonna turn it around and we're gonna bring our jobs back, folks.
We're gonna bring our jobs back. Just remember. So the other thing and I'm not sure that Boca feels the same way that a lot of other people do. But when I say this in certain parts of the country, they go wild. Are you ready? We are going to preserve our Second Amendment, OK? We're preserving our Second Amendment.
You know, a lot of things changed. I came down that escalator and I made a speech about illegal immigration. Boy, did I take heat. But after a month, took a lot of heat. But after a month, people realized I was right. People are pouring into this country. The crime is incredible. Then you see so many people being killed and now people are reading it and now it's really at the front of their mind.
All of a sudden, all these other candidates that would have never virtually brought it up. All of a sudden, it's a big deal. In fact, Ted Cruz the other day said, you know, he's talking. And he said, yes and we'll build a wall. He actually said, we'll build wall. I said, where did that come from? So here's what -- here's what's going to happen.
Here's what's going to happen and I mean, I mean, you are going to be so happy. Now, wait a minute, before we do anything, before we do anything, who is going to vote on Tuesday? Is that close to 100%? I think so. Is that 100%? Right. You promise, right? You promise. See, now a politician would say the following.
A politician would say, it's very important to vote. Go out and vote no matter who you're voting for. Very important. I don't say that. I say it's very important to vote, but only if you're gonna vote for Donald J. Trump, OK? Otherwise, don't vote. Do not vote if you're gonna vote for anybody else. OK. All right.
So, so is this -- I tell you what, is this place incredible? Is this incredible? I mean, it's incredible. I love you, folks. I love you, folks. So a couple of things. So we have to be smart. We're going to be smart. We have to be smart. We have to be sharp. We have to be vigilant. Now, we all have big hearts.
I have the biggest heart. I want to take care of people. I'm gonna take care of people. We have to be very careful. The Syrians, the migration, nobody knows who the people are. Nobody knows where they come from. You look at that mass migration of people.
All because of bad policy. This all happened because of a Hillary Clinton policy and Obama policy. A lot of bad policy. A lot of bad policy. So what we're gonna do is we build and we'll get Gulf State money. We're not using our money. We're gonna build safe zones. We're gonna make them. It's gonna be good.
And eventually, let them go back to their lands. You know, what I find? I have thousands of employees. I have people that come here and they become citizens and they work and they work for years. And you know, no matter how beautiful they do, no matter what, they all want to go back to their country. Countries that you'd be surprised at frankly.
They want to go back. They love their country. And in Syria, I think when it all settles out, which we hope is going to be at least soon. The damage, the horrible, horrible cost of lives, what's going on is terrible. But we're gonna do safe zones and we're gonna get the Gulf States to pay for it. We're not gonna pay for it. But we have to be smart.
We have to be vigilant. We can not let them come into our country. We have enough problems, folks. You saw what the two people did. They got married. She radicalized him. It sounds like. And they blew away, they killed 14 of their friends that had showers, baby showers for their baby and they killed him.
There's something going on. We have to get to the bottom of it. We will get to the bottom of it. But whatever it is, we can't have people come in unless they're fully documented. Unless, we know who they are, where they are, where they come from. So here's the story, OK, in a nutshell. Here is the story.
You have one of the most important days in your life coming up because our country is going to hell. We don't know what's happening. We're sitting on a very big fat ugly bubble. It started to pop with the stock market, comes back a little bit. Watch what's going to happen. But we are going to make some unbelievable and really straightforward just commonsense moves.
We're gonna ask people that we take care of got to pay us folks. These are rich, these are rich countries. You got to pay us. We're gonna bring so much money in that for a lot of seniors and a lot of the people that are gonna be seniors. We're gonna save you Social Security without all the cutting and the changes that these people are talking about.
I mean, if I do my job right, we're gonna have -- we're gonna be in such great shape. But here's the story, you've got to go out on Tuesday. You've got a vote on Tuesday and you're gonna be happy. Because here's what, we don't win anymore. We lose at everything. No matter what we do. We can't beat ISIS. Think of it, General Douglas MacArthur.
I loved Douglas MacArthur. He was a brutal guy. He was a brilliant guy. You know in the history of West Point, I don't know if it's still, but for many years, in the history of West Point, Douglas MacArthur had the highest grades in the history of West Point. That's pretty good. You know that always mean something to be called grades, maybe not everything, but it means something.
General George Patton. Can you imagine, can you imagine George Patton right now he's spinning in his grave when he sees that we're not beating ISIS. We are doing a politically correct war. We have to knock the hell -- they're cutting off heads. They're drowning people. We have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast.
We got to get back to our country. We have to rebuild our country now. It's time. It's now time that we rebuild the United States. Our roads are falling apart. Our schools, our schools are a disgrace. You see it on television. Rat infested, walls falling down. We build a school over there. They blow it up. We build it again.
They blow it up. We build. This goes on four, five times. And if they need money for Brooklyn, if they need money for Boca, if they need money for any place, we don't have any money to do anything. So I think it is wrong. We're gonna have really smart thinking. We've got the smartest people lined up. We are gonna think so good.
And here's what's gonna happen, we're gonna start winning again, OK? Because right now, when was the last time -- just think about it. When was the last time the United States won at everything? We're losing at war. We're losing at war. We're losing a trade with everybody. We're losing with everybody. This isn't China.
I use China because it's the greatest abuser of all. China abuses us more than anyone. I hope they still like me after this speech, by the way, but I don't care. You know I had the biggest bank in the world. He's a tenant of mine in Manhattan, from China, 400 million customers, the biggest in the world. I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building, 1290 Avenue.
A lot of buildings that I've got through war with China, with China. We could do great against China if we're smart. We can do great. I sell condos. You read about it the other day. I sell condos to people from China for tens of millions of dollars. I love China but their leaders are too smart for our leaders.
We can't let it keep going on. So here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna knock the hell out of ISIS. We're gonna, we're gonna start -- we're gonna knock off -- folks, folks, just relax. We can't, we can't let it go any further. It's too bad. It's too bad. We are going to start winning with our military.
We are going to take care of our vets. We are going have strong borders. We are going to build a wall and we are going to have Mexico pay for it. We are going to have great education. Right now, we're way down on the bottom of the list worldwide, but number one in cost per pupil. We're gonna get that changed around a lot.
We're going to get education taken care of. We're gonna do it locally. It's gonna be so much better, so much less expensive. And we're gonna be proud of our education. Because right now, our system is so broken, it's so bad and people are making so much money out of that system. So we're gonna win with education.
We're gonna win at every single level. We're gonna get rid of Obamacare. We're gonna win on health care. We're gonna win on health care. We're gonna start winning. And I'll tell you and I say it kiddingly, but I mean it 100%. We're gonna win, win, win. We're gonna win so much you're gonna get sick and tired of it. You're gonna say, Mr. President, we can't take it anymore.
You're winning too much. Please, we don't want to win that much anymore. Please, Mr. President. We can't take it. And I'm gonna say, I don't care. We're gonna keep winning because we're gonna make America great again. We're gonna make it greater than ever before. I love you. Go vote on Tuesday. I love you.
We're gonna win again. Thank you. I love you, folks. I love Boca. I love Florida. Go out. Start the winning. Start the winning. Thank you, folks. I love you.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Boca Raton, FL",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-boca-raton-fl-march-13-2016
Ed Davey,United Kingdom,2019-12-18,"May I, Mr Speaker-Elect, give you heartfelt congratulations from those on the Liberal Democrat Benches and wish you the very best as you manage the proceedings of this ​House? In your election in the last Parliament, you struck a chord with many Members when you spoke about improving the security of Members, staff and our families. It is sad to say that you were right to lead on this, not least as we remember the two young victims of the terrorist attack on London Bridge—Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt, two young people dedicated to helping others to whom we should pay tribute today as this House returns.
Mr Speaker-Elect, I was delighted that in your acceptance speech before the election you spoke eloquently and positively about the speaking rights of smaller parties. I can assure you, Sir, that Liberal Democrat Members want to make their voices heard, not least on behalf of the 3.7 million people who voted for us last Thursday. Under proportional voting, we would now easily be the third largest party in this House with 70 MPs—a fact that I know, Sir, you will take account of.
You will appreciate, Mr Speaker-Elect, that the past few days have been difficult for my colleagues and I, having seen our friend Jo Swinson lose her seat. Jo consistently said during the election that there is an issue even bigger than Brexit—namely, the climate emergency. On these Benches, we will be seeking your help as we raise this issue and argue for the radical climate change policies that Jo advocated. Thank you, Mr Speaker-Elect.
",2019 Speech in Commons Following General Election,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/ed-davey-2019-speech-in-commons-following-general-election/
Nick Clegg,United Kingdom,2015-11-25,"Since I became the Deputy Prime Minister I have had the privilege of spending a bit of time representing Britain’s interests in other parts of the world.
I have visited Latin America and Asia to boost exports. I have been to Africa, where we are building better education systems as well as helping fight corruption, poverty and disease. I have travelled to different parts of Europe and the United States to promote British trade.
And while each trip varies from the last, there is a thread which runs through them all: you get to see Britain through other people’s eyes.
Everywhere I have been – every nation around the planet – has its own story about Britain.
On a trade mission to South Korea I paid my respects at a war memorial at the bottom of a hill where, during the Korean War, British soldiers – heavily outnumbered – fought for three solid days to hold back North Korean and Chinese forces.
It is a battle that every single South Korean schoolchild learns about. Had we given up or been defeated, it could have cost their grandparents the war.
For Mexico, Britain is the first European country to have officially recognised their independence following their liberation from colonial rule. That means something to them.
In Colombia Britain is the nation that built their first railways.
Lynne Featherstone and I were in Ethiopia, for whom Britain is now the first member of the G8 to have met the decades-old promise by rich countries to spend 0.7% of our national wealth on aid for the developing world. Something we have long argued for and this Coalition has delivered.
So wherever you go one thing is clear: people don’t listen to our country out of some nostalgic deference to an old power. They listen because of who we are. Because of the things we’ve done. Because of the leadership we continue to show. And that makes me incredibly proud.
I love Britain.
I love it for all its contradictions.
I love that we are as modest as we are proud.
I love the way we can cherish our traditions yet innovate relentlessly, churning out one ingenious invention after the next. The telephone, the steam engine, the jet engine, the world wide web; the same nation that came up with stainless steel is now developing graphene – the strongest material the world has ever seen. Oscar winning visual effects; cutting-edge design; theatre, fashion, music, film – you name it, we do it, and we’re up there with the best.
I love that a country capable of extraordinary pomp and ceremony can still retain a spiky irreverence towards its establishment. A country where we line the streets waving our Union Jacks wildly to welcome the arrival of Prince George, and the next moment we’re chuckling at Private Eye’s front page: ‘Woman Has Baby’.
I love that we insist on queuing when we go abroad, even when the locals don’t.
I love that the BBC and NHS are known and respected across the planet.
I love that our cities are home to every race, religion, colour and language in existence.
I love Miriam telling me that the feeling of freedom you get in Britain simply doesn’t exist anywhere else.
I love that the shipping forecast is listened to by insomniacs of all ages, right across the country, miles from the sea.
I love how excited we get at the glimpse of any sun, insisting on staying out in our t-shirts and flip-flops – even when it’s obviously still cold.
I love living in a country synonymous with human rights and the rule of law.
I love that it was British lawyers who drafted the European Convention on Human Rights and a British Prime Minister who helped launch the Single Market. And I enjoy reminding my Coalition partners that it was a Prime Minister from their party at that.
I love that we do respond – the cliché is true – to every problem no matter how big or small with the same thing: a cup of tea.
I love that, wherever you go in the world, you’ll find football fans obsessed with the Premier League.
I love that we are a family of four different countries, each with their own characters, traditions and good-natured rivalries. And that’s why I want to see – we all want to see – Scotland stay in our family of nations later this year.
I look at what’s happening in places like Russia, where the government is effectively criminalising homosexuality, and I love that Britain is a place where you can be gay and proud – and now you can get married too.
Above all I love that, while we may be an island, we have always looked beyond our shores. Throughout our history, when we have seen trouble in the world we haven’t just looked the other way; we haven’t just crossed to the other side of the street; Britain doesn’t peer out at the rest of the world and shrug its shoulders. We are always at our best when we play our part.
This summer marks the centenary of the First World War. One hundred years ago hundreds of thousands of British troops headed into a conflict from which many of them would never return. When it ended my grandfather, not long out of school, climbed onto the roof of Westminster Abbey and watched the survivors come home – bloody, bruised and broken by the things they had seen. He told me that, in spite of everything, he was desperately upset that he hadn’t been called up to the front: because he passionately believed that to be a British soldier, defending our values of liberty and peace, was the most noble thing you could be.
Years later he married a woman who had herself come here to avoid conflict and revolution: my grandmother. She escaped Russia during the revolution, crossing Europe with her family and eventually settling in London. For her Britain offered a place of stability and safety. At a moment of great upheaval, this country welcomed her in and let her call it home.
There are few nations as open-minded and warm-hearted as ours. Smart, funny, compassionate Britain. Always changing, always evolving Britain. Humble enough to understand that we must work with others. Confident enough to lead.
For me it is these qualities that make this nation great – these great liberal qualities. Not some sepia-tinted memory of Empire. Not some stuffy parochialism dressed up as patriotism.
In the 21st Century, in a highly competitive, fluid and fast-moving world we hold our own because of our ability to embrace the future rather than cling to the past. It is our ability to look forward and outward and our capacity for reinvention – in other words our liberalism – that ensures this small island remains a giant on the world stage.
The question – one of the biggest questions of our time – is how we protect the liberal values of this nation.
Six years ago we suffered an unprecedented cardiac arrest in our banks.
This wasn’t just a recession. It was a shattering collapse of the basic assumptions by which successive governments had run our economy since the Big Bang.
This wasn’t just a downturn. We were a nation plunged into uncertainty as the thumping heart of our economy ground to a halt.
And you have to remember: even before this happened a quiet crisis of confidence was already creeping over developed economies like ours. Global power, money and influence have been shifting from West to East and from North to South for years. The previously fashionable view that the world would automatically slide towards greater freedom and democracy now feels presumptuous and naïve. Within our lifetimes America will no longer be the world’s biggest economy. It will be China: an authoritarian state.
Taken together, in societies across the Western world, these experiences have created an entirely understandable but dangerous urge to turn inwards. An urge to reject the new or unfamiliar and to shun the outside world.
If anyone doesn’t believe it, just glance across the Channel at our European neighbours, where a number of extremist parties are on the rise.
In Greece’s last parliamentary election the Golden Dawn Party secured 18 MPs. They ran on an anti-immigration platform. Their slogan? ‘So we can rid the land of this filth’.
Hungary’s Jobbik Party now has 43 MPs, one of whom has called for a register of Jews who he claims ‘pose a national security risk’.
In Bulgaria, Ataka makes up 10% of the National Assembly. One of their MPs has reviled Syrian refugees as ‘terrible, despicable primates’.
In the Netherlands Geert Wilder’s PVV party is polling at around 18%. They have called for the Koran to be banned, comparing it to Mein Kampf.
Front National. Around 21%. Their leader, Marine Le Pen, has compared Muslims praying in the streets to the Nazi occupation of France.
These are not far flung places. This is our backyard. The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. And there is no doubt about it: the fight is now on for the future direction of our continent.
We are lucky. Thankfully we do not have the same extremism here in the UK. But that’s not to say the fight isn’t on for the future of our country too.
An ungenerous, backwards looking politics has emerged in Britain. The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub. So I’m drawing a line in the sand. I am going to defend the tolerant and modern Britain we love, and I am going to start by showing people what’s at stake at the upcoming European elections: do you want Britain in Europe, or out?
That’s the real question in May. One party wants out. Another is flirting with exit. The other lot don’t have the courage of their convictions on this – they’re saying nothing at all.
The Liberal Democrats are now Britain’s only party of IN. The only party out there explaining the clear benefits of Britain’s place in Europe. The only party giving people the facts.
IN because Europe is our biggest export market and vital to British jobs. Because pulling up the drawbridge is the surest way to wreck our economic recovery.
IN because in the fight against climate change, and in a world where some of the biggest players are also the biggest polluters, Europe’s nations can only make a difference if we work together.
IN because cooperation between our police forces is essential for catching the criminals who cross our borders. Crime crosses borders, so must we.
IN because Britain stands tallest in the world when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.
This isn’t about some starry eyed affection for the EU – of course it needs reform. But you can’t change it with one foot out the door. You change it by taking your place at the table – which is where you protect Britain’s national interest and promote our values too.
How else would we, right now, be making our presence felt against Vladimir Putin’s Cold War aggression in the Ukraine?
The EU is a global economic superpower. By standing shoulder to shoulder with our European partners we have the clout to defend not just our own interests, but the interests of our continent as a whole.
So, for all these reasons, I’m IN.
Forget the lazy assumption that, in the court of public opinion, the eurosceptics will automatically win. There is nothing automatic about election results. A few months ago, when I asked people to take to Twitter to tell me why they’re IN, they did so in their thousands. It was our most successful online campaign ever.
There are plenty of people out there who don’t want anger. They don’t want bile. They want jobs. They want our country to have influence. They want opportunities. Ultimately they want hope.
And that, Liberal Democrats, is what it all comes down to. Hope. It’s the oldest dividing line in politics – hope versus fear – and it’s back.
We talk a lot about reducing the deficit, fiscal consolidation, bringing down public sector debt, increasing GDP, creating private sector jobs. But in the end what we’re really talking about is giving the British people the confidence to once again look to their futures with hope.
That’s how you lead a nation through difficult times. That’s how you hold a country together when its citizens are feeling the pressure. And that’s what the last four years in government have been about.
There is still a long way to go and many people are still feeling the squeeze. But after a period of grave uncertainty, the British people can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I hope that makes each and every one of you feel proud: there would be no recovery without the Liberal Democrats.
No recovery if we hadn’t decided to enter into coalition in order to provide the country with strong government.
No recovery if we hadn’t held our nerve and stuck to the plan.
No recovery if we had allowed the Coalition’s economic strategy to be solely about cuts. Sorting out the nation’s finances is essential but equally as important is investing in the foundations of lasting growth.
The unprecedented Treasury support that will transform Britain’s roads and rail.
The world’s first Green Investment Bank.
The billions of pounds spent on businesses across the country.
The million more young people who are now qualifying as apprentices.
Don’t let anyone airbrush out our role. Thanks to the heroic efforts and sacrifices of millions of people we have been able to pull this country back from the brink. Under extraordinary pressure we have achieved extraordinary things. And no matter what our critics say, when the history books are written they will say that, most extraordinary of all, the country was put back on the right track by a party which had never been in government before but which had the guts and the courage to do what it took.
And now a different challenge awaits.
We’ve been in emergency mode for the last four years, but that is slowly changing. If this parliament has been about a rescue, the next will be about reconstruction and renewal.
If we are truly ambitious for our country, Britain’s future cannot be like its past.
Successive governments relying on an overheated financial sector; presiding over a wildly imbalanced economy where the gap between rich and poor grew; where the North fell further and further behind the South.
Successive administrations jumping from one set of public service reforms to the next and Whitehall just seemed to carry on regardless as more and more power was sucked up to the centre.
I don’t want us ever to go back there. It cannot be right that the country goes through all of this pain only to end up where we started when it all went wrong.
In this coalition we have begun to turn the page, but the real test will come in the next parliament – when government will have to show whether or not we have really, genuinely, learnt from the mistakes of the past.
And I simply do not believe that our opponents have. I simply do not believe that they are up to this task.
Left to their own devices what are they offering the British people?
Profligacy. Economic incompetence. A bloated and cumbersome state. Politicians who think that all they need to do to prove themselves is posture against business. A leadership desperate but unable to break free from the grip of its Union paymasters. A party that cannot be relied upon to keep the economy safe; that wants us to put them back behind the wheel even though they still won’t admit how badly they got it wrong.
Or how about widening inequality. A remorseless shrinking of our public services. A party that claims we’re all in it together and yet refuses to ask the wealthy to pay even a penny more in tax towards the on-going fiscal effort. A party which will instead single out one group – the working age poor – for especially tough sacrifices. £12bn worth of especially tough sacrifices, from people who are trying to work their way out of poverty and who we should be helping stand on their own two feet.
A weak economy. An unfair society. If it all sounds depressingly familiar it’s because most of us have lived through it all before. Two parties encumbered by the same old prejudices; straitjacketed by the same old ideologies. And whichever way you look at it, left or right, if either of them get into government on their own, they will drag Britain in the same direction: backwards.
No. That’s not my Britain. That’s not the Britain I love. And I am not going to sit back while either of them sweep in and leave this nation diminished and divided because they still don’t understand what makes our country great.
Liberal Democrats think of that when you’re out campaigning in the crucial coming weeks – in your wards, in your communities, in your regions for our hardworking councillors and our excellent team of MEPs.
When I tell you that we need to get back into government again – protecting Britain from one party rule – this is why:
Because we are the guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain.
Because we are the only party who will not ask the British people to choose between a stronger economy and a fairer society. They don’t have to. They can have both if we make our shared mission enabling every single person to get on in life.
Because we are the only party with the imagination and ambition needed to ensure Britain draws a line under some of our worst times with our best qualities intact.
In government again the Liberal Democrats will continue rewiring our economy so that our banks are the servant and not the master. So that, instead of fake booms and reckless consumption, we invest in growth that is balanced and sustainable, which stretches across every corner of Britain and which conserves our natural resources too.
That is how we embrace a better future rather than repeat the mistakes of the past.
We’ll finish the job of balancing the books, but continuing to spread the burden fairly, as we have been in this government – giving Britain a stronger economy and a fairer society too.
The future, not the past.
We’ll continue correcting the imbalance in our tax system, so that it doesn’t just protect the wealthy but properly rewards work.
And, yes, that means that in the coming Budget Danny Alexander and I are pushing to take the Liberal Democrat income tax cut even further than we had originally planned in this parliament.
We are about to hit the target that was on the front page of our manifesto: raising the personal allowance so that no one pays a penny of income tax on the first £10,000 they earn, saving over 20 million people £700. Now we want to go beyond that, taking the total tax cut to £800.
And if we’re in government again we’ll go further still: no one paying a penny in tax on the first £12,500 they earn.
Fairer taxes. The future, not the past.
We’ll create an education system that, from toddler to graduate, allows our all of our children to rise as far as their talents and efforts will take them, irrespective of the circumstances of their birth.
The future, not the past.
We’ll transfer ever more power to our cities and communities so that they can drive their own destinies and we break Whitehall’s grip for good.
The future, not the past.
We will ensure that this country rises to the challenge that will define the 21st Century: playing our part in the fight against climate change, for the sake of our children and the planet we leave behind.
The future, not the past.
And we will live up to our greatest traditions by keeping Britain engaged, outward facing, a heavyweight in Europe and a leader in the world.
If this sounds like the Britain you want, the Liberal Democrats are the party for you.
Between now and the election my aim – our aim – is to build a coalition bringing together all of the liberal-minded, liberal-hearted men and women who love the Britain we love – and who want a party prepared to fight for it. That’s the coalition I care about. A coalition of all the people who want to keep this nation open, tolerant, compassionate and strong.
So to the people out there who may not have voted for us before: it doesn’t matter, that’s the past. What matters now is the kind of country you want to live in. The kind of nation you want us to be.
Open not closed.
In not out.
Great Britain not little England.
Forward not back.
Hope not fear.
The future not the past.
If you have faith in this country, if you believe in Britain’s values, if you still want this incredible island of ours to keep punching above our weight and shaping the world so that it is a better place, put the Liberal Democrats back in government again – let us protect the Britain you love.
",2014 Speech to Liberal Democrat Spring Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/nick-clegg-2014-speech-to-liberal-democrat-spring-conference/
Mike Pence,United States of America,2020-10-12,"Hello Ohio. The Lieutenant Governor Husted, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, my friend, Congressman Troy Balderson, the state Republican Chairman Jane Timken, all my fellow Americans near and far. It is great to be back in the Buckeye State. Happy Columbus Day. And it’s also great to be here with a family business that’s created near their 400 good paying Ohio jobs. Would you join me in thanking Marty Savko, Senior, Marty Savko, Jr., and all the great men and women of Savko &amp; Sons. What a great family. And I appreciate y’all coming out today. But I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Ohio and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. It’s on Ohio and the road to victory runs right through the Buckeye State.
Really is great to be with all of you. I had a busy week last week. I don’t know if you got to see it, but I had a little debate with Kamala Harris over in Salt Lake city. Some people think we did all right, but let me be clear with all of you. Let me be clear with all of you. That debate was not just a debate between two candidates for vice president. It was a debate between two visions. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine. They want to abolish fossil fuels. They want taxpayer funding of abortion, defund the police and pack the Supreme Court. Don’t you doubt it.
President Trump’s vision, we rebuild our military. We cut taxes. We roll back regulations. We unleashed American energy. We secured our border, supported law enforcement, stood for life and liberty and the Constitution of the United States.
And everything we’d done, obviously, got them a little bit worked up. But I got to tell you, when the people of Ohio compare the Biden Harris agenda with our agenda, the choice is clear. If you cherish faith and freedom, law and order and life in 22 days, we need you to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. It’s true.
Four years ago, we inherited a military that’s been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression.
Boy, is it good to be back in the Heartland? I’m telling you what. I grew up just right next door. I tell people I come from a place with people with strong hearts and strong opinions. But this is a country that loves the proud heritage, past, present and future of the good old USA.
Now, like I started to say, four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by reckless budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, terrorism was on the rise around the world, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values.
But in three short years, we rebuild our military, we restored the arsenal of democracy, and as your vice-president and the proud father of a United States Marine, I’m happy to report, we’re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation.
I mean, did you know when we took office… when we took office, there was a large number of aircraft in the Air Force that were kept on the ground to be used as spare parts, to keep other aircraft in the air. But thanks to President Donald Trump, those days are over. President Trump has signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We’ve stood with those who serve and their families. And we’ve stood with all of you who wore the uniform of the United States of America.
When Joe Biden was Vice President, America saw years of heartbreaking scandal at the VA that shocked the conscience of the nation. I mean, here in this city that’s home to more than 100,000 veterans and you all live through it like we did. I mean, there were actually veterans who perished waiting to receive basic care at VA facilities. But under President Donald Trump, and I’m proud to report, we’ve signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired thousands of VA employees that weren’t providing the care our veterans earned. And now Veterans Choice is now available to every veteran in America.
In fact, if you’re able to stand, please do, otherwise raise your hand. If you wore the uniform of the United States, would you just put your hand in the air and give us a chance to thank you one more time for your service to America. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. God bless you. Thank you.
Great Americans.
We didn’t just rebuild our military and support our veterans. In our first three years, we revived the American economy. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, President Trump cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses just like this one. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history. We unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade. And it just three short years, businesses large and small created more than 7 million good paying jobs, including 97,000 jobs right here in the Buckeye State.
And a good example’s right here at Savko &amp; Sons. I was talking to the family on my way in. They told me after President Trump’s tax cuts, the Savko’s bought 70 new pieces of equipment and trucks. Some of them are right around us here. More importantly, they told me they gave their employees substantial pay raises and Savko &amp; Sons doubled in size and they are hiring today. What a great family and a great company.
It’s amazing to think this company started like so many other great American companies began, with Marty’s dad, his mom, and a wheelbarrow. He was an Army veteran, had just come back from World War II, the son of an immigrant, coal miner, who literally walked to Columbus from the mines of Western Pennsylvania. Nick Savko built everything that matters, a family, a business and a good name. He lived the American dream.
But today we’re joined by a woman without whom none of that would have been possible. She’s the daughter of an Italian immigrant. She helped lead this company for decades, the former Democrat, who’s now supporting President Donald Trump, 97 years young. Would you join me in welcoming, Gilda Savko, the matriarch of Savko &amp; Sons. Thank you, Gilda. Thank you, Gilda. I walked up and Gilda said, “I’ve been praying for you.” And I said, “Well, that explains a lot.” Thank you, Gilda. Thank you for you and your example in your family. We’re so inspired.
We’ve stood for our national defense, for our veterans and for jobs and opportunities, businesses just like this one. And President Donald Trump has stood every day for the rule of law. We’ve appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold all the God-given liberties in our constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. Now, last month we rightly-
Now last month we rightly paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But when the memorials were over, President Donald Trump fulfilled his duty under the Constitution, and he nominated an extraordinary, principled, conservative woman to the Supreme Court of the United States, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Now the Senate started their confirmation hearings this morning, all the senators were doing their opening remarks. The questioning will probably start tomorrow and the president said, “Democrats on the judiciary committee need to give Judge Barrett a respectful and dignified hearing this time.” But we have reason to be concerned. You all remember the attacks on Judge Barrett’s faith, when she was confirmed to the Court of Appeals just two years ago. Democrats and their Hollywood friends have already started to attack Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Christian faith as well, this time around.
Back then one Democrat questioned her qualifications because he called her quote, “An Orthodox Catholic.” Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris actually attacked another one of our nominees to the federal courts because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. And the ranking Democrat on the judiciary committee says, “Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith was of concern.” And said, quote, “The dogma lives loudly within you.” Well, I got news for the Democrats and their friends in Hollywood. That dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of our faith and conscience lives in the Constitution of the United States of America.
These attacks on religious faith must stop and they must stop now. Now the Senate has a job to do and after they discharged their duty to advise and consent, I’ll make a prediction. Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We’re going to fill that seat.
Speaking of the Supreme Court, the American people also deserve to know that Democrats are actually talking about adding seats to the Supreme Court. It’s called packing the court, if they win this election. It would be nothing less than the biggest power grab in American history. They want to pack the court with liberal judges. They want to tear down more than a century and a half of judicial independence in this country. After 150 years with nine seats on the Supreme Court of the United States, Democrats in Washington are talking about packing the court. And Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won’t tell the American people what they’re going to do. Joe Biden refused to answer the question during the presidential debate.
You might’ve seen Kamala Harris refuse to answer the question that when I posed it to her during the vice presidential debate. And last Friday, Joe Biden was asked if voters deserve to know if he plans to pack the court? And Joe Biden said, quote, “No, they don’t.” Well Joe, yes, they do. The American people deserve a straight answer and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris need to come clean with the American people and come clean right now. When you’re running for the highest court in the land, the American people deserve to know whether you’re going to respect the highest court in the land. The truth is there’s only one explanation why they won’t answer the question, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to pack the Supreme Court, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years in the White House. And we’re going to preserve an independent judiciary for generations to come.
So we’ve stood for the rule of law and an independent judiciary. And every single day, President Donald Trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will. Let’s hear it for all those in law enforcement who are with us here today.
I like to say all my heroes wear uniforms, whether it’s those you who wore the uniform of the United States or those of you who put on the uniform of law enforcement. I have to tell you, since I was a little boy, we’d go up to we’d visit my grandparents and we were there with my uncle who was a Chicago police officer for 25 years. He’d come out in the morning, dressed in that uniform, sidearm strapped to his belt. Me and my three brothers would just looked at him in awe. I think you all know, the men and women who serve in law enforcement in this country are the best people in America. And they deserve the respect of every American every day. Thank you for your service.
Now, President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech, violence against innocent civilians, the destruction of property or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated. And those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Now for months all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protestors, remember? All summer long. As the American people literally watch businesses in their communities burn to the ground.
I was in Minneapolis, not long ago. I traveled with Flora Westbrook. A wonderful African-American business owner who told me of that night, just a few days after the killing of George Floyd. That she watched violent protesters come closer and closer and closer to her business. A business that she built a little salon, 35 years ago and they burned her out. And I stood alongside what remains of her business, just a few short weeks ago. And I told flora from the heart of this president and the heart of the American people, we’re going to rebuild that business. We’re going to rebuild that community bigger and better than ever before.
Flora, and all those like her who’ve been victimized by these violent protestors and rioters deserve nothing less. But the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in our cities. I mean, when you start to withdraw support for those who protect and serve, you only emboldened those who would do harm to our communities and our families.
Now, Joe Biden explains it all by saying that America is in his words, systemically racist. And that police as he said, and his running mate said last week. That police have a quote, ” Implicit bias against minorities.” When Joe Biden was asked if he’d support cutting funding of law enforcement, he said, “Yes, absolutely.” Let me make your promise. Under President Donald Trump, we’re going to back the blue. We’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. Under President Donald Trump, we’re going to have law and order in every city, in every state for every American of every race and creed and color. So help us God. The president and I know what you know, we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors and families. We have done both for the last three and a half years, and we’re going to keep supporting law enforcement and keep expanding opportunities and jobs and education for African-Americans and all of our minorities for four more years.
So we’ve stood for the rule of law, for law and order and all the values that have made this country great. And I can’t tell you how proud I am to be vice-president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. Where Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history.
So we’ve rebuilt our military, revived our economy, stood for law and order, liberties in life. In three short years, we made America great again. And none of that would have been possible without the strong support of our allies in Congress. That’s why we need to send Congressman Troy Balderson back to a new Republican majority that retires Nancy Pelosi once and for all.
What a great guy and what a great, great champion of this administration. Thank you, Congressman Balderson. So we made great progress in our first three years, and then the coronavirus struck from China. But I’m here to tell you, when there were just five cases of the coronavirus in the United States, President Trump did what no other American president had ever done, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden said that was “hysterical, xenophobic.” He actually wrote in the month of January that banning travel “would make things worse.” But I can tell you, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, President Donald Trump’s action, suspending travel from China, saved untold American lives and it bought us time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. It’s true.
We reinvented testing. We saw to the factoring delivery of hundreds of millions of medical supplies to our incredible doctors and nurses. We developed medicines that are literally saving lives and we are on track to have the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year, it’s going to happen. As the President said on the South Lawn on Friday, through the power of American science and medicine, we will eradicate the China virus once and for all. I spoke to the President this morning and I’m happy to report to all of you here in the Buckeye State, the President and the First Lady are doing great and he is back on the road today. But let me take this opportunity on behalf of the President to say how move we’ve all been by the outpouring of prayers concern for the first family. I know how much it’s meant to them. But he and I both believe it’s really just a reflection of the outpouring of concern and prayers, and care that the American people have shown to all of our neighbors throughout this pandemic.
So can we just take a moment to show our appreciation for the doctors, the nurses, the first responders, those in ministry, all those that have come alongside our families who have suffered loss and struggled with this pandemic, we are so grateful to you all. Thank you so much. So every day we’re one day closer to that day we put the coronavirus in the past with a vaccine and medicines. But in the meantime, I promise you we’ll keep protecting the vulnerable. Keep making sure our healthcare workers have all the supplies they need. We’ll keep saving lives. And were Joe Biden is talking about shutting down the economy, President Donald Trump, he’s opening up America again. I mean, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, I’m proud to report to you that we’ve already seen 11 and a half million Americans go back to work, including more than 400,000 people right here in the state of Ohio.
We’re not just opening up America, we’re opening up America’s schools. We just announced about two weeks ago that we’re sending a hundred million rapid tests for the coronavirus to every school system, every school nurse in America. So our kids can get back in the classroom and stay back in the classroom safe and sound. The schools are opening and thanks to President Donald Trump in just two short weeks, it’s going to be, O-H-
Buckeye football is coming back. How good is that? In fact, I just heard that the quarterback who won the national championship back in 2014 is actually with us today. Cardale Jones, where are you? Let’s hear it for Cardale Jones. O-H-
I’ll tell you what, it’s a little tough for this Hoosier to cheer for Ohio State, but I know how excited you all are, we are too. So we’ve gone through a time of testing. You all are here today because three weeks from tomorrow, we’re coming to a time for choosing. The choice in this election has never been clearer, the stakes have never been higher. It’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars. President Trump, we not only cut taxes across the board in our first four years, we’re going to keep cutting middle class taxes for four more years. Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of regulation. He had to be reminded in that presidential debate that he supports the Green New Deal. He wants to put us back in that Paris Climate Accord. President Trump, he unleashed American energy. We’ve stood with coal miners in Eastern Ohio and now America’s a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. Joe Biden’s for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and free healthcare for illegal immigrants. President Trump, he’s made record investments in border security. We’ve already built more than 300 miles of that border wall on the Southern border of the United States. And with four more years, we’re going to fix this broken immigration system once and for all. And when it comes to jobs and trade, contrast is clearer still. Here in the Heartland, I don’t have to tell any of you about the impact of NAFTA over the last 25 years. Over in the Hoosier state, we literally saw entire communities shuttered, jobs shipped south of the border. 60,000 factories closed in the 25 years after NAFTA was signed into law. And Joe Biden never lifted a finger to reform it or renegotiate it. But thanks to the man who wrote the Art of the Deal, Ohio got a better deal. NAFTA is gone and the U.S.M.C.A. is here to stay. It’s a win for Ohio and a win for America.
And for decades, for decades we saw America losing out to China in international trade. When we came into office, half of our international trade deficit was with communist China, $500 billion a year lost to that one country. Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way. He actually said that the rise of China was a positive development for America. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all the tariffs that President Trump has put into effect to hold China accountable and level the playing field for American workers. President Trump, he put China on notice on day one and the era of economic surrender is over. We’re going to stand strong until China opens their markets to U.S. goods and respects the intellectual property rights of American businesses.
So we’ve stood strong for security, prosperity, free market principles, and putting America first. And as President Trump said at Mount Rushmore, we’ve also stood against those who would, in his words, wipe out our history, defame our heroes, and erase our values. But the truth is Joe Biden and today’s Democratic Party have been giving in to the most radical voices in this country. Voices that want to cancel our culture and erase our history. On this Columbus Day, we should remember that day earlier this year when radicals toppled the Christopher Columbus statue in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. Beheaded the statue of the great explorer in Boston. And here in Columbus, Ohio, last summer in the dead of night, your Democrat mayor took down the statue of Christopher Columbus outside city hall.
And folks it’s still going on. I don’t know if you saw on the news this morning but last night, violent protesters in Portland tore down statues of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. The truth is, as the President has said, today the radical left is determined to tear down every statute, symbol and memory of our national heritage. But the American people are strong and proud. We will not allow our country and all its history and culture to be taken away from us. That’s one more reason why we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.
When you look at their agenda, tearing down our economy, tearing down our institutions, tearing down our history. It’s clear, Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. Now, Joe Biden has said that democracy is on the ballot. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. But there are also things far more foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. In this election-
In this election, I think it’s not going to be whether America will end up more conservative or more liberal, more red or more blue, more Republican or more Democrat. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America. Whether we’re going to allow Joe Biden and the Democratic Party to steer our nation on a leftward path toward more government, less freedom, and abandonment of our most cherished ideals in history, or whether we’re going to reaffirm our commitment to everything that’s always made America great.
So, I want to say to each and every one of you here, three weeks and one day away from election, for our freedom and all the ideals that have made this nation exceptional and great, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of United States of America. We’re going to re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years.
It’s on, Ohio. It’s going to take all of us. Ohio always looms large in presidential elections all throughout our history, and that’s just as true today. So, we need you to tell your neighbors and friends. Just say, “Hey, I was over at Savko &amp; Sons the other day. I ran into Mike, and he was telling me we need four more years.” And if they say to you, “What’s that mean?” Say, “Well, four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops and our police.” And you tell them I said it’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.
Oh, we’re draining it. Four years ago, a movement was born. The movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Ohio, you believe we could be strong again. You believe we could be prosperous again. You believe America could be proud again, stand tall in the world again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I know the Buckeye State’s going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020.
I’ve really only known this president for about four years. We’d met each other a couple of times along the way, but when I met him, before he asked me to join this ticket I sensed what you did four years ago. I sensed a vision, a belief in America, a belief in the American people, and the leadership qualities to make it happen. I joined that ticket in a heartbeat.
Some people think we’re kind of different.
But I got to tell you’ve gotten be to very close friends, and it’s the greatest honor in my life to be vice president to President Donald Trump. It is, and I thank you for the honor. But I want to tell you something, I’ve seen it firsthand, I’ve been at his side every day for the last three and a half years, and I’ll make you a promise. Even when the cameras are off and nobody’s around there’s not a day gone by that President Donald Trump hasn’t gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of Ohio. Now it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s on, Ohio. We got to bring it. We got to bring it.
So, keep bringing all this enthusiasm. Keep voicing your support. Talk about all that we’ve accomplished all across the Buckeye State and all across America. Let me give you a couple of tasks. Number one, vote, Ohio. Vote to re-elect President Donald Trump. I actually heard that early starting already started here. Early voting. In fact, I checked on my way here, you can actually leave from here and go to the Franklin County Board of Elections at 1700 Morse Road. They’re open until 5:00 today. Go and vote to re-elect President Donald Trump, and remember, friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a friend. Get it done. Get it done early. Then we need you to go to work. You need to reach out to your neighbors and friends and tell them what’s at stake in this election. Volunteer your time. Make some phone calls. Knock on a few doors. Do everything you can. Finally, if you’re of a mind of bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, in the next three weeks and one day I’d encourage you to do that too.
In all of my travels over the last four years, I’m convinced of two things. America is a freedom-loving nation and America is a nation of faith. It truly is. And so, in these challenging times where that little girl that asked the question at the end of the vice-presidential debate, where you turn on the television and it seems like there’s more that divides us than unites us in this country, I’ll always believe that there’s a wellspring of support that unites us in America far beyond anything that could divide us, and that’s the faith of the American people. So, in the days between now and election day, I’d encourage you to pray. And on this one, I just encourage you to pray for all of the American people.
In these challenging times, global pandemic, times of division and dissension in our nation, I still believe that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, in turn, that he’ll do like he’s always done through the long and storied history of this nation. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land. This one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So, pray for America. Pray for all the American people. It’ll make a difference.
And I’m absolutely convinced when you get out and vote and bring your neighbors, and friends, and family to the polls between now and election day, when you get out and tell that story that with your continued support and prayers every day between now and November 3rd, we’re going to make Ohio and America more prosperous than ever before. We’re going to make Ohio and America safer than ever before. And with Troy Balderson and a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, with a re-elected Republican majority in the United States Senate, with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years and with God’s help, we’re going to make America great again. Again.
Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless, America. Let’s go get it done.
","Mike Pence Campaign Speech Columbus, Ohio Transcript October 12",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/mike-pence-campaign-speech-columbus-ohio-transcript-october-12
Grover Cleveland,United States of America,1895-12-02 00:00:00,"To the Congress of the United States: The present assemblage of the legislative branch of our Government occurs at a time when the interests of our people and the needs of the country give especial prominence to the condition of our foreign relations and the exigencies of our national finances. The reports of the heads of the several administrative Departments of the Government fully and plainly exhibit what has been accomplished within the scope of their respective duties and present such recommendations for the betterment of our country's condition as patriotic and intelligent labor and observation suggest. I therefore deem my executive duty adequately performed at this time by presenting to the Congress the important phases of our situation as related to our intercourse with foreign nations and a statement of the financial problems which confront us, omitting, except as they are related to these topics, any reference to departmental operations. I earnestly invite, however, not only the careful consideration but the severely critical scrutiny of the Congress and my fellow-countrymen to the reports concerning these departmental operations. If justly and fairly examined, they will furnish proof of assiduous and painstaking care for the public welfare. I press the recommendations they contain upon the respectful attention of those charged with the duty of legislation, because I believe their adoption would promote the people's good. By amendatory tariff legislation in January last the Argentine Republic, recognizing the value of the large market opened to the free importation of its wools under our last tariff act, has admitted certain products of the United States to entry at reduced duties. It is pleasing to note that the efforts we have made to enlarge the exchanges of trade on a sound basis of mutual benefit are in this instance appreciated by the country from which our woolen factories draw their needful supply of raw material. The Missions boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and Brazil, referred to the President of the United States as arbitrator during the term of my predecessor, and which was submitted to me for determination, resulted in an award in favor of Brazil upon the historical and documentary evidence presented, thus ending a long-protracted controversy and again demonstrating the wisdom and desirability of settling international boundary disputes by recourse to friendly arbitration. Negotiations are progressing for a revival of the United States and Chilean Claims Commission, whose work was abruptly terminated last year by the expiration of the stipulated time within which awards could be made. The resumption of specie payments by Chile is a step of great interest and importance both in its direct consequences upon her own welfare and as evincing the ascendency of sound financial principles in one of the most influential of the South American Republics. The close of the momentous struggle between China and Japan, while relieving the diplomatic agents of this Government from the delicate duty they undertook at the request of both countries of rendering such service to the subjects of either belligerent within the territorial limits of the other as our neutral position permitted, developed a domestic condition in the Chinese Empire which has caused much anxiety and called for prompt and careful attention. Either as a result of a weak control by the central Government over the provincial administrations, following a diminution of traditional governmental authority under the stress of an overwhelming national disaster, or as a manifestation upon good opportunity of the aversion of the Chinese population to all foreign ways and undertakings, there have occurred in widely separated provinces of China serious outbreaks of the old fanatical spirit against foreigners, which, unchecked by the local authorities, if not actually connived at by them, have culminated in mob attacks on foreign missionary stations, causing much destruction of property and attended with personal injuries as well as loss of life. Although but one American citizen was reported to have been actually wounded, and although the destruction of property may have fallen more heavily upon the missionaries of other nationalities than our own, it plainly behooved this Government to take the most prompt and decided action to guard against similar or perhaps more dreadful calamities befalling the hundreds of American mission stations which have grown up throughout the interior of China under the temperate rule of toleration, custom, and imperial edict. The demands of the United States and other powers for the degradation and punishment of the responsible officials of the respective cities and provinces who by neglect or otherwise had permitted uprisings, and for the adoption of stern measures by the Emperor's Government for the protection of the life and property of foreigners, were followed by the disgrace and dismissal of certain provincial officials found derelict in duty and the punishment by death of a number of those adjudged guilty of actual participation in the outrages. This Government also insisted that a special American commission should visit the province where the first disturbances occurred for the purpose of investigation. The latter commission, formed after much opposition, has gone overland from Tientsin, accompanied by a suitable Chinese escort, and by its demonstration of the readiness and ability of our Government to protect its citizens will act, it is believed, as a most influential deterrent of any similar outbreaks. The energetic steps we have thus taken are all the more likely to result in future safety to our citizens in China because the Imperial Government is, I am persuaded, entirely convinced that we desire only the liberty and protection of our own citizens and redress for any wrongs they may have suffered, and that we have no ulterior designs or objects, political or otherwise. China will not forget either our kindly service to her citizens during her late war nor the further fact that, while furnishing all the facilities at our command to further the negotiation of a peace between her and Japan, we sought no advantages and interposed no counsel. The Governments of both China and Japan have, in special dispatches transmitted through their respective diplomatic representatives, expressed in a most pleasing manner their grateful appreciation of our assistance to their citizens during the unhappy struggle and of the value of our aid in paving the way to their resumption of peaceful relations. The customary cordial relations between this country and France have been undisturbed, with the exception that a full explanation of the treatment of John L. Waller by the expeditionary military authorities of France still remains to be given. Mr. Waller, formerly United States consul at Tamatav, remained in Madagascar after his term of office expired, and was apparently successful in procuring business concessions from the Hovas of greater or less value. After the occupation of Tamatav and the declaration of martial law by the French he was arrested upon various charges, among them that of communicating military information to the enemies of France, was tried and convicted by a military tribunal, and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. Following the course justified by abundant precedents, this Government requested from that of France the record of the proceedings of the French tribunal which resulted in Mr. Waller's condemnation. This request has been complied with to the extent of supplying a copy of the official record, from which appear the constitution and organization of the court, the charges as formulated, and the general course and result of the trial, and by which it is shown that the accused was tried in open court and was defended by counsel; but the evidence adduced in support of the charges, which was not received by the French minister for foreign affairs till the first week in October, has thus far been withheld, the French Government taking the ground that its production in response to our demand would establish a bad precedent. The efforts of our ambassador to procure it, however, though impeded by recent changes in the French ministry, have not been relaxed, and it is confidently expected that some satisfactory solution of the matter will shortly be reached. Meanwhile it appears that Mr. Waller's confinement has every alleviation which the state of his health and all the other circumstances of the case demand or permit. In agreeable contrast to the difference above noted respecting a matter of common concern, where nothing is sought except such a mutually satisfactory outcome as the true merits of the case require, is the recent resolution of the French Chambers favoring the conclusion of a permanent treaty of arbitration between the two countries. An invitation has been extended by France to the Government and people of the United States to participate in a great international exposition at Paris in 1900 as a suitable commemoration of the close of this the world's marvelous century of progress. I heartily recommend its acceptance, together with such legislation as will adequately provide for a due representation of this Government and its people on the occasion. Our relations with the States of the German Empire are in some aspects typical of a condition of things elsewhere found in countries whose productions and trade are similar to our own. The close rivalries of competing industries; the influence of the delusive doctrine that the internal development of a nation is promoted and its wealth increased by a policy which, in undertaking to reserve its home markets for the exclusive use of its own producers, necessarily obstructs their sales in foreign markets and prevents free access to the products of the world; the desire to retain trade in time-worn ruts, regardless of the inexorable laws of new needs and changed conditions of demand and supply, and our own halting tardiness in inviting a freer exchange of commodities, and by this means imperiling our footing in the external markets naturally open to us, have created a situation somewhat injurious to American export interests, not only in Germany, where they are perhaps most noticeable, but in adjacent countries. The exports affected are largely American cattle and other food products, the reason assigned for unfavorable discrimination being that their consumption is deleterious to the public health. This is all the more irritating in view of the fact that no European state is as jealous of the excellence and wholesomeness of its exported food supplies as the United States, nor so easily able, on account of inherent soundness, to guarantee those qualities. Nor are these difficulties confined to our food products designed for exportation. Our great insurance companies, for example, having built up a vast business abroad and invested a large share of their gains in foreign countries in compliance with the local laws and regulations then existing, now find themselves within a narrowing circle of onerous and unforeseen conditions, and are confronted by the necessity of retirement from a field thus made unprofitable, if, indeed, they are not summarily expelled, as some of them have lately been from Prussia. It is not to be forgotten that international trade can not be one-sided. Its currents are alternating, and its movements should be honestly reciprocal. Without this it almost necessarily degenerates into a device to gain advantage or a contrivance to secure benefits with only the semblance of a return. In our dealings with other nations we ought to be open-handed and scrupulously fair. This should be our policy as a producing nation, and it plainly becomes us as a people who love generosity and the moral aspects of national good faith and reciprocal forbearance. These considerations should not, however, constrain us to submit to unfair discrimination nor to silently acquiesce in vexatious hindrances to the enjoyment of our share of the legitimate advantages of proper trade relations. If an examination of the situation suggests such measures on our part as would involve restrictions similar to those from which we suffer, the way to such a course is easy. It should, however, by no means be lightly entered upon, since the necessity for the inauguration of such a policy would be regretted by the best sentiment of our people and because it naturally and logically might lead to consequences of the gravest character. I take pleasure in calling to your attention the encomiums bestowed on those vessels of our new Navy which took part in the notable ceremony of the opening of the Kiel Canal. It was fitting that this extraordinary achievement of the newer German nationality should be celebrated in the presence of America's exposition of the latest developments of the world' s naval energy. Our relations with Great Britain, always intimate and important, have demanded during the past year even a greater share of consideration than is usual. Several vexatious questions were left undetermined by the decision of the Bering Sea Arbitration Tribunal. The application of the principles laid down by that august body has not been followed by the results they were intended to accomplish, either because the principles themselves lacked in breadth and definiteness or because their execution has been more or less imperfect. Much correspondence has been exchanged between the two Governments on the subject of preventing the exterminating slaughter of seals. The insufficiency of the British patrol of Bering Sea under the regulations agreed on by the two Governments has been pointed out, and yet only two British ships have been on police duty during this season in those waters. The need of a more effective enforcement of existing regulations as well as the adoption of such additional regulations as experience has shown to be absolutely necessary to carry out the intent of the award have been earnestly urged upon the British Government, but thus far without effective results. In the meantime the depletion of the seal herds by means of pelagic hunting has so alarmingly progressed that unless their slaughter is at once effectively checked their extinction within a few years seems to be a matter of absolute certainty. The understanding by which the United States was to pay and Great Britain to receive a lump sum of $425,000 in full settlement of all British claims for damages arising from our seizure of British sealing vessels unauthorized under the award of the Paris Tribunal of Arbitration was not confirmed by the last Congress, which declined to make the necessary appropriation. I am still of the opinion that this arrangement was a judicious and advantageous one for the Government, and I earnestly recommend that it be again considered and sanctioned. If, however, this does not meet with the favor of Congress, it certainly will hardly dissent from the proposition that the Government is bound by every consideration of honor and good faith to provide for the speedy adjustment of these claims by arbitration as the only other alternative. A treaty of arbitration has therefore been agreed upon, and will be immediately laid before the Senate, so that in one of the modes suggested a final settlement may be reached. Notwithstanding that Great Britain originated the proposal to enforce international rules for the prevention of collisions at sea, based on the recommendations of the Maritime Conference of Washington, and concurred in, suggesting March 11, 1895, as the date to be set by proclamation for carrying these rules into general effect, Her Majesty's Government, having encountered opposition on the part of British shipping interests, announced its inability to accept that date, which was consequently canceled. The entire matter is still in abeyance, without prospect of a better condition in the near future. The commissioners appointed to mark the international boundary in Passamaquoddy Bay according to the description of the treaty of Ghent have not yet fully agreed. The completion of the preliminary survey of that Alaskan boundary which follows the contour of the coast from the southernmost point of Prince of Wales Island until it strikes the one hundred and forty-first meridian at or near the summit of Mount St. Elias awaits further necessary appropriation, which is urgently recommended. This survey was undertaken under the provisions of the convention entered into by this country and Great Britain July 22, 1892, and the supplementary convention of February 3, 1894.As to the remaining section of the Alaskan boundary, which follows the one hundred and forty-first meridian northwardly from Mount St. Elias to the Frozen Ocean, the settlement of which involves the physical location of the meridian mentioned, no conventional agreement has yet been made. The ascertainment of a given meridian at a particular point is a work requiring much time and careful observations and surveys. Such observations and surveys were undertaken by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1890 and 1891, while similar work in the same quarters, under British auspices, is believed to give nearly coincident results; but these surveys have been independently conducted, and no international agreement to mark those or any other parts of the one hundred and forty-first meridian by permanent monuments has yet been made. In the meantime the valley of the Yukon is becoming a highway through the hitherto unexplored wilds of Alaska, and abundant mineral wealth has been discovered in that region, especially at or near the junction of the boundary meridian with the Yukon and its tributaries. In these circumstances it is expedient, and, indeed, imperative, that the jurisdictional limits of the respective Governments in this new region be speedily determined. Her Britannic Majesty's Government has proposed a joint delimitation of the one hundred and forty-first meridian by an international commission of experts, which, if Congress will authorize it and make due provision therefor, can be accomplished with no unreasonable delay. It is impossible to overlook the vital importance of continuing the work already entered upon and supplementing it by further effective measures looking to the exact location of this entire boundary line. I call attention to the unsatisfactory delimitation of the respective jurisdictions of the United States and the Dominion of Canada in the Great Lakes at the approaches to the narrow waters that connect them. The waters in question are frequented by fishermen of both nationalities and their nets are there used. Owing to the uncertainty and ignorance as to the true boundary, vexations disputes and injurious seizures of boats and nets by Canadian cruisers often occur, while any positive settlement thereof by an accepted standard is not easily to be reached. A joint commission to determine the line in those quarters on a practical basis, by measured courses following range marks on shore, is a necessity for which immediate provision should be made. It being apparent that the boundary dispute between Great Britain and the Republic of Venezuela concerning the limits of British Guiana was approaching an acute stage, a definite statement of the interest and policy of the United States as regards the controversy seemed to be required both on its own account and in view of its relations with the friendly powers directly concerned. In July last, therefore, a dispatch was addressed to our ambassador at London for communication to the British Government in which the attitude of the United States was fully and distinctly set forth. The general conclusions therein reached and formulated are in substance that the traditional and established policy of this Government is firmly opposed to a forcible increase by any European power of its territorial possessions on this continent; that this policy is as well rounded in principle as it is strongly supported by numerous precedents; that as a consequence the United States is bound to protest against the enlargement of the area of British Guiana in derogation of the rights and against the will of Venezuela; that considering the disparity in strength of Great Britain and Venezuela the territorial dispute between them can be reasonably settled only by friendly and impartial arbitration, and that the resort to such arbitration should include the whole controversy, and is not satisfied if one of the powers concerned is permitted to draw an arbitrary line through the territory in debate and to declare that it will submit to arbitration only the portion lying on one side of it. In view of these conclusions, the dispatch in question called upon the British Government for a definite answer to the question whether it would or would not submit the territorial controversy between itself and Venezuela in its entirety to impartial arbitration. The answer of the British Government has not yet been received, but is expected shortly, when further communication on the subject will probably be made to the Congress. Early in January last an uprising against the Government of Hawaii was promptly suppressed. Martial law was forthwith proclaimed and numerous arrests were made of persons suspected of being in sympathy with the Royalist party. Among these were several citizens of the United States, who were either convicted by a military court and sentenced to death, imprisonment, or fine or were deported without trial. The United States, while denying protection to such as had taken the Hawaiian oath of allegiance, insisted that martial law, though altering the forms of justice, could not supersede justice itself, and demanded stay of execution until the proceedings had been submitted to this Government and knowledge obtained therefrom that our citizens had received fair trial. The death sentences were subsequently commuted or were remitted on condition of leaving the islands. The cases of certain Americans arrested and expelled by arbitrary order without formal charge or trial have had attention, and in some instances have been found to justify remonstrance and a claim for indemnity, which Hawaii has not thus far conceded. Mr. Thurston, the Hawaiian minister, having furnished this Government abundant reason for asking that he be recalled, that course was pursued, and his successor has lately been received. The deplorable lynching of several Italian laborers in Colorado was naturally followed by international representations, and I am happy to say that the best efforts of the State in which the outrages occurred have been put forth to discover and punish the authors of this atrocious crime. The dependent families of some of the unfortunate victims invite by their deplorable condition gracious provision for their needs. These manifestations against helpless aliens may be traced through successive stages to the vicious padroni system, which, unchecked by our immigration and contract-labor statutes, controls these workers from the moment of landing on our shores and farms them out in distant and often rude regions, where their cheapening competition in the fields of bread-winning toil brings them into collision with other labor interests. While welcoming, as we should, those who seek our shores to merge themselves in our body politic and win personal competence by honest effort, we can not regard such assemblages of distinctively alien laborers, hired out in the mass to the profit of alien speculators and shipped hither and thither as the prospect of gain may dictate, as otherwise than repugnant to the spirit of our civilization, deterrent to individual advancement, and hindrances to the building up of stable communities resting upon the wholesome ambitions of the citizen and constituting the prime factor in the prosperity and progress of our nation. If legislation can reach this growing evil, it certainly should be attempted. Japan has furnished abundant evidence of her vast gain in every trait and characteristic that constitutes a nation's greatness. We have reason for congratulation in the fact that the Government of the United States, by the exchange of liberal treaty stipulations with the new Japan, was the first to recognize her wonderful advance and to extend to her the consideration and confidence due to her national enlightenment and progressive character. The boundary dispute which lately threatened to embroil Guatemala and Mexico has happily yielded to pacific counsels, and its determination has, by the joint agreement of the parties, been submitted to the sole arbitration of the United States minister to Mexico. The commission appointed under the convention of February 18, 1889, to set new monuments along the boundary between the United States and Mexico has completed its task. As a sequel to the failure of a scheme for the colonization in Mexico of negroes, mostly immigrants from Alabama under contract, a great number of these helpless and suffering people, starving and smitten with contagious disease, made their way or were assisted to the frontier, where, in wretched plight, they were quarantined by the Texas authorities. Learning of their destitute condition, I directed rations to be temporarily furnished them through the War Department. At the expiration of their quarantine they were conveyed by the railway companies at comparatively nominal rates to their homes in Alabama, upon my assurance, in the absence of any fund available for the cost of their transportation, that I would recommend to Congress an appropriation for its payment. I now strongly urge upon Congress the propriety of making such an appropriation. It should be remembered that the measures taken were dictated not only by sympathy and humanity, but by a conviction that it was not compatible with the dignity of this Government that so large a body of our dependent citizens should be thrown for relief upon the charity of a neighboring state. In last year's message I narrated at some length the jurisdictional questions then freshly arisen in the Mosquito Indian Strip of Nicaragua. Since that time, by the voluntary act of the Mosquito Nation, the territory reserved to them has been incorporated with Nicaragua, the Indians formally subjecting themselves to be governed by the general laws and regulations of the Republic instead of by their own customs and regulations, and thus availing themselves of a privilege secured to them by the treaty between Nicaragua and Great Britain of January 28, 1860.After this extension of uniform Nicaraguan administration to the Mosquito Strip, the case of the British vice-consul, Hatch, and of several of his countrymen who had been summarily expelled from Nicaragua and treated with considerable indignity provoked a claim by Great Britain upon Nicaragua for pecuniary indemnity, which, upon Nicaragua's refusal to admit liability, was enforced by Great Britain. While the sovereignty and jurisdiction of Nicaragua was in no way questioned by Great Britain, the former's arbitrary conduct in regard to British subjects furnished the ground for this proceeding. A British naval force occupied without resistance the Pacific seaport of Corinto, but was soon after withdrawn upon the promise that the sum demanded would be paid. Throughout this incident the kindly offices of the United States were invoked and were employed in favor of as peaceful a settlement and as much consideration and indulgence toward Nicaragua as were consistent with the nature of the case. Our efforts have since been made the subject of appreciative and grateful recognition by Nicaragua. The coronation of the Czar of Russia at Moscow in May next invites the ceremonial participation of the United States, and in accordance with usage and diplomatic propriety our minister to the imperial court has been directed to represent our Government on the occasion. Correspondence is on foot touching the practice of Russian consuls within the jurisdiction of the United States to interrogate citizens as to their race and religious faith, and upon ascertainment thereof to deny to Jews authentication of passports or legal documents for use in Russia. Inasmuch as such a proceeding imposes a disability which in the case of succession to property in Russia may be found to infringe the treaty rights of our citizens, and which is an obnoxious invasion of our territorial jurisdiction, it has elicited fitting remonstrance, the result of which, it is hoped, will remove the cause of complaint. The pending claims of sealing vessels of the United States seized in Russian waters remain unadjusted. Our recent convention with Russia establishing a modus vivendi as to imperial jurisdiction in such cases has prevented further difficulty of this nature. The Russian Government has welcomed in principle our suggestion for a modus vivendi, to embrace Great Britain and Japan, looking to the better preservation of seal life in the North Pacific and Bering Sea and the extension of the protected area defined by the Paris Tribunal to all Pacific waters north of the thirty-fifth parallel. It is especially noticeable that Russia favors prohibition of the use of firearms in seal hunting throughout the proposed area and a longer closed season for pelagic sealing. In my last two annual messages I called the attention of the Congress to the position we occupied as one of the parties to a treaty or agreement by which we became jointly bound with England and Germany to so interfere with the government and control of Samoa as in effect to assume the management of its affairs. On the 9th day of May, 1894, I transmitted to the Senate a special message, with accompanying documents, giving information on the subject and emphasizing the opinion I have at all times entertained, that our situation in this matter was inconsistent with the mission and traditions of our Government, in violation of the principles we profess, and in all its phases mischievous and vexatious. I again press this subject upon the attention of the Congress and ask for such legislative action or expression as will lead the way to our relief from obligations both irksome and unnatural. Cuba is again gravely disturbed. An insurrection in some respects more active than the last preceding revolt, which continued from 1868 to 1878, now exists in a large part of the eastern interior of the island, menacing even some populations on the coast. Besides deranging the commercial exchanges of the island, of which our country takes the predominant share, this flagrant condition of hostilities, by arousing sentimental sympathy and inciting adventurous support among our people, has entailed earnest effort on the part of this Government to enforce obedience to our neutrality laws and to prevent the territory of the United States from being abused as a vantage ground from which to aid those in arms against Spanish sovereignty. Whatever may be the traditional sympathy of our countrymen as individuals with a people who seem to be struggling for larger autonomy and greater freedom, deepened, as such sympathy naturally must be, in behalf of our neighbors, yet the plain duty of their Government is to observe in good faith the recognized obligations of international relationship. The performance of this duty should not be made more difficult by a disregard on the part of our citizens of the obligations growing out of their allegiance to their country, which should restrain them from violating as individuals the neutrality which the nation of which they are members is bound to observe in its relations to friendly sovereign states. Though neither the warmth of our people's sympathy with the Cuban insurgents, nor our loss and material damage consequent upon the futile endeavors thus far made to restore peace and order, nor any shock our humane sensibilities may have received from the cruelties which appear to especially characterize this sanguinary and fiercely conducted war, have in the least shaken the determination of the Government to honestly fulfill every international obligation, yet it is to be earnestly hoped on every ground that the devastation of armed conflict may speedily be stayed and order and quiet restored to the distracted island, bringing in their train the activity and thrift of peaceful pursuits. One notable instance of interference by Spain with passing American ships has occurred. On March 8 last the Allianca, while bound from Colon to New York, and following the customary track for vessels near the Cuban shore, but outside the 3-mile limit, was fired upon by a Spanish gunboat. Protest was promptly made by the United States against this act as not being justified by a state of war, nor permissible in respect of vessels on the usual paths of commerce, nor tolerable in view of the wanton peril occasioned to innocent life and property. The act was disavowed, with full expression of regret and assurance of nonrecurrence of such just cause of complaint, while the offending officer was relieved of his command. Military arrests of citizens of the United States in Cuba have occasioned frequent reclamations. Where held on criminal charges their delivery to the ordinary civil jurisdiction for trial has been demanded and obtained in conformity with treaty provisions, and where merely detained by way of military precaution under a proclaimed state of siege, without formulated accusation, their release or trial has been insisted upon. The right of American consular officers in the island to prefer protests and demands in such cases having been questioned by the insular authority, their enjoyment of the privilege stipulated by treaty for the consuls of Germany was claimed under the most-favored-nation provision of our own convention and was promptly recognized. The long-standing demand of Antonio Maximo Mora against Spain has at last been settled by the payment, on the 14th of September last, of the sum originally agreed upon in liquidation of the claim. Its distribution among the parties entitled to receive it has proceeded as rapidly as the rights of those claiming the fund could be safely determined. The enforcement of differential duties against products of this country exported to Cuba and Puerto Rico prompted the immediate claim on our part to the benefit of the minimum tariff of Spain in return for the most favorable treatment permitted by our laws as regards the production of Spanish territories. A commercial arrangement was concluded in January last securing the treatment so claimed. Vigorous protests against excessive fines imposed on our ships and merchandise by the customs officers of these islands for trivial errors have resulted in the remission of such fines in instances where the equity of the complaint was apparent, though the vexatious practice has not been wholly discontinued. Occurrences in Turkey have continued to excite concern. The reported massacres of Christians in Armenia and the development there and in other districts of a spirit of fanatic hostility to Christian influences naturally excited apprehension for the safety of the devoted men and women who, as dependents of the foreign missionary societies in the United States, reside in Turkey under the guaranty of law and usage and in the legitimate performance of their educational and religious mission. No efforts have been spared in their behalf, and their protection in person and property has been earnestly and vigorously enforced by every means within our power. I regret, however, that an attempt on our part to obtain better information concerning the true condition of affairs in the disturbed quarter of the Ottoman Empire by sending thither the United States consul at Sivas to make investigation and report was thwarted by the objections of the Turkish Government. This movement on our part was in no sense meant as a gratuitous entanglement of the United States in the so-called Eastern question nor as an officious interference with the right and duty which belong by treaty to certain great European powers calling for their intervention in political matters affecting the good government and religious freedom of the non-Mussulman subjects of the Sultan, but it arose solely from our desire to have an accurate knowledge of the conditions in our efforts to care for those entitled to our protection. The presence of our naval vessels which are now in the vicinity of the disturbed localities affords opportunities to acquire a measure of familiarity with the condition of affairs and will enable us to take suitable steps for the protection of any interests of our countrymen within reach of our ships that might be found imperiled. The Ottoman Government has lately issued an imperial irade exempting forever from taxation an American college for girls at Scutari. Repeated assurances have also been obtained by our envoy at Constantinople that similar institutions maintained and administered by our countrymen shall be secured in the enjoyment of all rights and that our citizens throughout the Empire shall be protected. The Government, however, in view of existing facts, is far from relying upon such assurances as the limit of its duty. Our minister has been vigilant and alert in affording all possible protection in individual cases where danger threatened or safety was imperiled. We have sent ships as far toward the points of actual disturbance as it is possible for them to go, where they offer refuge to those obliged to flee, and we have the promise of other powers which have ships in the neighborhood that our citizens as well as theirs will be received and protected on board those ships. On the demand of our minister orders have been issued by the Sultan that Turkish soldiers shall guard and escort to the coast American refugees. These orders have been carried out, and our latest intelligence gives assurance of the present personal safety of our citizens and missionaries. Though thus far no lives of American citizens have been sacrificed, there can be no doubt that serious loss and destruction of mission property have resulted from riotous conflicts and outrageous attacks. By treaty several of the most powerful European powers have secured a right and have assumed a duty not only in behalf of their own citizens and in furtherance of their own interests, but as agents of the Christian world. Their right is to enforce such conduct of Turkish government as will restrain fanatical brutality, and if this fails their duty is to so interfere as to insure against such dreadful occurrences in Turkey as have lately shocked civilization. The powers declare this right and this duty to be theirs alone, and it is earnestly hoped that prompt and effective action on their part will not be delayed. The new consulates at Erzerum and Harpoot, for which appropriation was made last session, have been provisionally filled by trusted employees of the Department of State. These appointees, though now in Turkey, have not yet received their exequaturs. The arbitration of the claim of the Venezuela Steam Transportation Company under the treaty of January 19, 1892, between the United States and Venezuela, resulted in an award in favor of the claimant. The Government has used its good offices toward composing the differences between Venezuela on the one hand and France and Belgium on the other growing out of the dismissal of the representatives of those powers on the ground of a publication deemed offensive to Venezuela. Although that dismissal was coupled with a cordial request that other more personally agreeable envoys be sent in their stead, a rupture of intercourse ensued and still continues. In view of the growth of our interests in foreign countries and the encouraging prospects for a general expansion of our commerce, the question of an improvement in the consular service has increased in importance and urgency. Though there is no doubt that the great body of consular officers are rendering valuable services to the trade and industries of the country, the need of some plan of appointment and control which would tend to secure a higher average of efficiency can not be denied. The importance of the subject has led the Executive to consider what steps might properly be taken without additional legislation to answer the need of a better system of consular appointments. The matter having been committed to the consideration of the Secretary of State, in pursuance of his recommendations an Executive order was issued on the 20th of September, 1895, by the terms of which it is provided that after that date any vacancy in a consulate or commercial agency with an annual salary or compensation from official fees of not more than $2,500 or less than $1,000 should be filled either by transfer or promotion from some other position under the Department of State of a character tending to qualify the incumbent for the position to be filled, or by the appointment of a person not under the Department of State, but having previously served thereunder and shown his capacity and fitness for consular duty, or by the appointment of a person who, having been selected by the President and sent to a board for examination, is found upon such examination to be qualified for the position. Posts which pay less than $1,000 being usually, on account of their small compensation, filled by selection from residents of the locality, it was not deemed practicable to put them under the new system. The compensation of $2,500 was adopted as the maximum limit in the classification for the reason that consular officers receiving more than that sum are often charged with functions and duties scarcely inferior in dignity and importance to those of diplomatic agents, and it was therefore thought best to continue their selection in the discretion of the Executive without subjecting them to examination before a board. Excluding 71 places with compensation at present less than $1,000 and 53 places above the maximum in compensation, the number of positions remaining within the scope of the order is 196. This number will undoubtedly be increased by the inclusion of consular officers whose remuneration in fees, now less than $1,000, will be augmented with the growth of our foreign commerce and a return to more favorable business conditions. In execution of the Executive order referred to the Secretary of State has designated as a board to conduct the prescribed examinations the Third Assistant Secretary of State, the Solicitor of the Department of State, and the Chief of the Consular Bureau, and has specified the subjects to which such examinations shall relate. It is not assumed that this system will prove a full measure of consular reform. It is quite probable that actual experience will show particulars in which the order already issued may be amended and demonstrate that for the best results appropriate legislation by Congress is imperatively required. In any event, these efforts to improve the consular service ought to be immediately supplemented by legislation providing for consular inspection. This has frequently been a subject of Executive recommendation, and I again urge such action by Congress as will permit the frequent and thorough inspection of consulates by officers appointed for that purpose or by persons already in the diplomatic or consular service. The expense attending such a plan would be insignificant compared with its usefulness, and I hope the legislation necessary to set it on foot will be speedily forthcoming. I am thoroughly convinced that in addition to their salaries our ambassadors and ministers at foreign courts should be provided by the Government with official residences. The salaries of these officers are comparatively small and in most cases insufficient to pay, with other necessary expenses, the cost of maintaining household establishments in keeping with their important and delicate functions. The usefulness of a nation's diplomatic representative undeniably depends much upon the appropriateness of his surroundings, and a country like ours, while avoiding unnecessary glitter and show, should be certain that it does not suffer in its relations with foreign nations through parsimony and shabbiness in its diplomatic outfit. These considerations and the other advantages of having fixed and somewhat permanent locations for our embassies would abundantly justify the moderate expenditure necessary to carry out this suggestion. As we turn from a review of our foreign relations to the contemplation of our national financial situation we are immediately aware that we approach a subject of domestic concern more important than any other that can engage our attention, and one at present in such a perplexing and delicate predicament as to require prompt and wise treatment. We may well be encouraged to earnest effort in this direction when we recall the steps already taken toward improving our economic and financial situation and when we appreciate how well the way has been prepared for further progress by an aroused and intelligent popular interest in these subjects. By command of the people a customs-revenue system designed for the protection and benefit of favored classes at the expense of the great mass of our countrymen, and which, while inefficient for the purpose of revenue, curtailed our trade relations and impeded our entrance to the markets of the world, has been superseded by a tariff policy which in principle is based upon a denial of the right of the Government to obstruct the avenues to our people's cheap living or lessen their comfort and contentment for the sake of according especial advantages to favorites, and which, while encouraging our intercourse and trade with other nations, recognizes the fact that American self-reliance, thrift, and ingenuity can build up our country's industries and develop its resources more surely than enervating paternalism. The compulsory purchase and coinage of silver by the Government, unchecked and unregulated by business conditions and heedless of our currency needs, which for more than fifteen years diluted our circulating medium, undermined confidence abroad in our financial ability, and at last culminated in distress and panic at home, has been recently stopped by the repeal of the laws which forced this reckless scheme upon the country. The things thus accomplished, notwithstanding their extreme importance and beneficent effects, fall far short of curing the monetary evils from which we suffer as a result of long indulgence in ill-advised financial expedients. The currency denominated United States notes and commonly known as greenbacks was issued in large volume during the late Civil War and was intended originally to meet the exigencies of that period. It will be seen by a reference to the debates in Congress at the time the laws were passed authorizing the issue of these notes that their advocates declared they were intended for only temporary use and to meet the emergency of war. In almost if not all the laws relating to them some provision was made contemplating their voluntary or compulsory retirement. A large quantity of them, however, were kept on foot and mingled with the currency of the country, so that at the close of the year 1874 they amounted to $381,999,073.Immediately after that date, and in January, 1875, a law was passed providing for the resumption of specie payments, by which the Secretary of the Treasury was required whenever additional circulation was issued to national banks to retire United States notes equal in amount to 80 per cent of such additional national-bank circulation until such notes were reduced to $300,000,000. This law further provided that on and after the 1st day of January, 1879, the United States notes then outstanding should be redeemed in coin, and in order to provide and prepare for such redemption the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized not only to use any surplus revenues of the Government, but to issue bonds of the United States and dispose of them for coin and to use the proceeds for the purposes contemplated by the statute. In May, 1878, and before the date thus appointed for the redemption and retirement of these notes, another statute was passed forbidding their further cancellation and retirement. Some of them had, however, been previously redeemed and canceled upon the issue of additional national-bank circulation, as permitted by the law of 1875, so that the amount outstanding at the time of the passage of the act forbidding their further retirement was $346,681,016.The law of 1878 did not stop at distinct prohibition, but contained in addition the following express provision: And when any of said notes may be redeemed or be received into the Treasury under any law from any source whatever, and shall belong to the United States, they shall not be retired, canceled, or destroyed, but they shall be reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation. This was the condition of affairs on the 1st day of January, 1879, which had been fixed upon four years before as the date for entering upon the redemption and retirement of all these notes, and for which such abundant means had been provided. The Government was put in the anomalous situation of owing to the holders of its notes debts payable in gold on demand which could neither be retired by receiving such notes in discharge of obligations due the Government nor canceled by actual payment in gold. It was forced to redeem without redemption and to pay without acquittance. There had been issued and sold $95,500,000 of the bonds authorized by the resumption act of 1875, the proceeds of which, together with other gold in the Treasury, created a gold fund deemed sufficient to meet the demands which might be made upon it for the redemption of the outstanding United States notes. This fund, together with such other gold as might be from time to time in the Treasury available for the same purpose, has been since called our gold reserve, and $100,000,000 has been regarded as an adequate amount to accomplish its object. This fund amounted on the 1st day of January, 1879, to $114,193,360, and though thereafter constantly fluctuating it did not fall below that sum until July, 1892. In April, 1893, for the first time since its establishment, this reserve amounted to less than $100,000,000, containing at that date only $97,011,330.In the meantime, and in July, 1890, an act had been passed directing larger governmental monthly purchases of silver than had been required under previous laws, and providing that in payment for such silver Treasury notes of the United States should be issued payable on demand in gold or silver coin, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. It was, however, declared in the act to be"" the established policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be provided by law."" In view of this declaration it was not deemed permissible for the Secretary of the Treasury to exercise the discretion in terms conferred on him by refusing to pay gold on these notes when demanded, because by such discrimination in favor of the gold dollar the so-called parity of the two metals would be destroyed and grave and dangerous consequences would be precipitated by affirming or accentuating the constantly widening disparity between their actual values under the existing ratio. It thus resulted that the Treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the law of 1890 were necessarily treated as gold obligations at the option of the holder. These notes on the 1st day of November, 1893, when the law compelling the monthly purchase of silver was repealed, amounted to more than $155,000,000. The notes of this description now outstanding added to the United States notes still undiminished by redemption or cancellation constitute a volume of gold obligations amounting to nearly $500,000,000.These obligations are the instruments which ever since we had a gold reserve have been used to deplete it. This reserve, as has been stated, had fallen in April, 1893, to $97,111,330. It has from that time to the present, with very few and unimportant upward movements, steadily decreased, except as it has been temporarily replenished by the sale of bonds. Among the causes for this constant and uniform shrinkage in this fund may be mentioned the great falling off of exports under the operation of the tariff law until recently in force, which crippled our exchange of commodities with foreign nations and necessitated to some extent the payment of our balances in gold; the unnatural infusion of silver into our currency and the increasing agitation for its free and unlimited coinage, which have created apprehension as to our disposition or ability to continue gold payments; the consequent hoarding of gold at home and the stoppage of investments of foreign capital, as well as the return of our securities already sold abroad; and the high rate of foreign exchange, which induced the shipment of our gold to be drawn against as a matter of speculation. In consequence of these conditions the gold reserve on the 1st day of February, 1894, was reduced to $65,438,377, having lost more than $31,000,000 during the preceding nine months, or since April, 1893. Its replenishment being necessary and no other manner of accomplishing it being possible, resort was had to the issue and sale of bonds provided for by the resumption act of 1875. Fifty millions of these bonds were sold, yielding $58,633,295.71, which was added to the reserve fund of gold then on hand. As a result of this operation this reserve, which had suffered constant and large withdrawals in the meantime, stood on the 6th day of March, 1894, at the sum of $107,446,802. Its depletion was, however, immediately thereafter so accelerated that on the 30th day of June, 1894, it had fallen to $64,873,025, thus losing by withdrawals more than $42,000,000 in five months and dropping slightly below its situation when the sale of $50,000,000 in bonds was effected for its replenishment. This depressed condition grew worse, and on the 24th day of November, 1894, our gold reserve being reduced to $57,669,701, it became necessary to again strengthen it. This was done by another sale of bonds amounting to $50,000,000, from which there was realized $58,538,500, with which the fund was increased to $111,142,021 on the 4th day of December, 1894.Again disappointment awaited the anxious hope for relief. There was not even a lull in the exasperating withdrawals of gold. On the contrary, they grew larger and more persistent than ever. Between the 4th day of December, 1894, and early in February, 1895, a period of scarcely more than two months after the second reenforcement of our gold reserve by the sale of bonds, it had lost by such withdrawals more than $69,000,000 and had fallen to $41,340,181. Nearly $43,000,000 had been withdrawn within the month immediately preceding this situation. In anticipation of impending trouble I had on the 28th day of January, 1895, addressed a communication to the Congress fully setting forth our difficulties and dangerous position and earnestly recommending that authority be given the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds bearing a low rate of interest, payable by their terms in gold, for the purpose of maintaining a sufficient gold reserve and also for the redemption and cancellation of outstanding United States notes and the Treasury notes issued for the purchase of silver under the law of 1890. This recommendation did not, however, meet with legislative approval. In February, 1895, therefore, the situation was exceedingly critical. With a reserve perilously low and a refusal of Congressional aid, everything indicated that the end of gold payments by the Government was imminent. The results of prior bond issues had been exceedingly unsatisfactory, and the large withdrawals of gold immediately succeeding their public sale in open market gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that a large part of the gold paid into the Treasury upon such sales was promptly drawn out again by the presentation of United States notes or Treasury notes, and found its way to the hands of those who had only temporarily parted with it in the purchase of bonds. In this emergency, and in view of its surrounding perplexities, it became entirely apparent to those upon whom the struggle for safety was devolved not only that our gold reserve must, for the third time in less than thirteen months, be restored by another issue and sale of bonds bearing a high rate of interest and badly suited to the purpose, but that a plan must be adopted for their disposition promising better results than those realized on previous sales. An agreement was therefore made with a number of financiers and bankers whereby it was stipulated that bonds described in the resumption act of 1875, payable in coin thirty years after their date, bearing interest at the rate of 4 pet cent per annum, and amounting to about $62,000,000, should be exchanged for gold, receivable by weight, amounting to a little more than $65,000,000.This gold was to be delivered in such installments as would complete its delivery within about six months from the date of the contract, and at least one-half of the amount was to be furnished from abroad. It was also agreed by those supplying this gold that during the continuance of the contract they would by every means in their power protect the Government against gold withdrawals. The contract also provided that if Congress would authorize their issue bonds payable by their terms in gold and bearing interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum might within ten days be substituted at par for the 4 per cent bonds described in the agreement. On the day this contract was made its terms were communicated to Congress by a special Executive message, in which it was stated that more than $16,000,000 would be saved to the Government if gold bonds bearing 3 per cent interest were authorized to be substituted for those mentioned in the contract. The Congress having declined to grant the necessary authority to secure this saving, the contract, unmodified, was carried out, resulting in a gold reserve amounting to $107,571,230 on the 8th day of July, 1895. The performance of this contract not only restored the reserve, but checked for a time the withdrawals of gold and brought on a period of restored confidence and such peace and quiet in business circles as were of the greatest possible value to every interest that affects our people. I have never had the slightest misgiving concerning the wisdom or propriety of this arrangement, and am quite willing to answer for my full share of responsibility for its promotion. I believe it averted a disaster the imminence of which was, fortunately, not at the time generally understood by our people. Though the contract mentioned stayed for a time the tide of gold withdrawal, its good results could not be permanent. Recent withdrawals have reduced the reserve from $107,571,230 on the 8th day of July, 1895, to $79,333,966. How long it will remain large enough to render its increase unnecessary is only matter of conjecture, though quite large withdrawals for shipment in the immediate future are predicted in well-informed quarters. About $16,000,000 has been withdrawn during the month of November. The foregoing statement of events and conditions develops the fact that after increasing our interest-bearing bonded indebtedness more than $162,000,000 to save our gold reserve we are nearly where we started, having now in such reserve $79,333,966, as against $65,438,377 in February, 1894, when the first bonds were issued. Though the amount of gold drawn from the Treasury appears to be very large as gathered from the facts and figures herein presented, it actually was much larger, considerable sums having been acquired by the Treasury within the several periods stated without the issue of bonds. On the 28th of January, 1895, it was reported by the Secretary of the Treasury that more than $172,000,000 of gold had been withdrawn for hoarding or shipment during the year preceding. He now reports that from January 1, 1879, to July 14, 1890, a period of more than eleven years, only a little over $28,000,000 was withdrawn, and that between July 14, 1890, the date of the passage of the law for an increased purchase of silver, and the 1st day of December, 1895, or within less than five and a half years, there was withdrawn nearly $375,000,000, making a total of more than $403,000,000 drawn from the Treasury in gold since January 1, 1879, the date fixed in 1875 for the retirement of the United States notes. Nearly $327,000,000 of the gold thus withdrawn has been paid out on these United States notes, and yet every one of the $346,000,000 is still uncanceled and ready to do service in future gold depletions. More than $76,000,000 in gold has since their creation in 1890 been paid out from the Treasury upon the notes given on the purchase of silver by the Government, and yet the whole, amounting to $155,000,000, except a little more than $16,000,000 which has been retired by exchanges for silver at the request of the holders, remains outstanding and prepared to join their older and more experienced allies in future raids upon the Treasury's gold reserve. In other words, the Government has paid in gold more than nine-tenths of its United States notes and still owes them all. It has paid in gold about one-half of its notes given for silver purchases without extinguishing by such payment one dollar of these notes. When, added to all this, we are reminded that to carry on this astound, lug financial scheme the Government has incurred a bonded indebtedness of $95,500,000 in establishing a gold reserve and of $162,315,400 in efforts to maintain it; that the annual interest charge on such bonded indebtedness is more than $11,000,000; that a continuance of our present course may result in further bond issues, and that we have suffered or are threatened with all this for the sake of supplying gold for foreign shipment or facilitating its hoarding at home, a situation is exhibited which certainly ought to arrest attention and provoke immediate legislative relief. I am convinced the only thorough and practicable remedy for our troubles is found in the retirement and cancellation of our United States notes, commonly called greenbacks, and the outstanding Treasury notes issued by the Government in payment of silver purchases under the act of 1890.I believe this could be quite readily accomplished by the exchange of these notes for United States bonds, of small as well as large denominations, bearing a low rate of interest. They should be long-term bonds, thus increasing their desirability as investments, and because their payment could be well postponed to a period far removed from present financial burdens and perplexities, when with increased prosperity and resources they would be more easily met. To further insure the cancellation of these notes and also provide a way by which gold may be added to our currency in lieu of them, a feature in the plan should be an authority given to the Secretary of the Treasury to dispose of the bonds abroad for gold if necessary to complete the contemplated redemption and cancellation, permitting him to use the proceeds of such bonds to take up and cancel any of the notes that may be in the Treasury or that may be received by the Government on any account. The increase of our bonded debt involved in this plan would be amply compensated by renewed activity and enterprise in all business circles, the restored confidence at home, the reinstated faith in our monetary strength abroad, and the stimulation of every interest and industry that would follow the cancellation of the gold-demand obligations now afflicting us. In any event, the bonds proposed would stand for the extinguishment of a troublesome indebtedness, while in the path we now follow there lurks the menace of unending bonds, with our indebtedness still undischarged and aggravated in every feature. The obligations necessary to fund this indebtedness would not equal in amount those from which we have been relieved since 1884 by anticipation and payment beyond the requirements of the sinking fund out of our surplus revenues. The currency withdrawn by the retirement of the United States notes and Treasury notes, amounting to probably less than $486,000,000, might be supplied by such gold as would be used on their retirement or by an increase in the circulation of our national banks. Though the aggregate capital of those now in existence amounts to more than $664,000,000, their outstanding circulation based on bond security amounts to only about $190,000,000. They are authorized to issue notes amounting to 90 per cent of the bonds deposited to secure their circulation, but in no event beyond the amount of their capital stock, and they are obliged to pay 1 per cent tax on the circulation they issue. I think they should be allowed to issue circulation equal to the par value of the bonds they deposit to secure it, and that the tax on their circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of 1 per cent, which would undoubtedly meet all the expense the Government incurs on their account. In addition they should be allowed to substitute or deposit in lieu of the bonds now required as security for their circulation those which would be issued for the purpose of retiring the United States notes and Treasury notes. The banks already existing, if they desired to avail themselves of the provisions of law thus modified, could issue circulation, in addition to that already outstanding, amounting to $478,000,000, which would nearly or quite equal the currency proposed to be canceled. At any rate, I should confidently expect to see the existing national banks or others to be organized avail themselves of the proposed encouragements to issue circulation and promptly fill any vacuum and supply every currency need. It has always seemed to me that the provisions of law regarding the capital of national banks, which operate as a limitation to their location, fail to make proper compensation for the suppression of State banks, which came near to the people in all sections of the country and readily furnished them with banking accommodations and facilities. Any inconvenience or embarrassment arising from these restrictions on the location of national banks might well be remedied by better adapting the present system to the creation of banks in smaller communities or by permitting banks of large capital to establish branches in such localities as would serve the people, so regulated and restrained as to secure their safe and conservative control and management. But there might not be the necessity for such an addition to the currency by new issues of bank circulation as at first glance is indicated. If we should be relieved from maintaining a gold reserve under conditions that constitute it the barometer of our solvency, and if our Treasury should no longer be the foolish purveyor of gold for nations abroad or for speculation and hoarding by our citizens at home, I should expect to see gold resume its natural and normal functions in the business affairs of the country and cease to be an object attracting the timid watch of our people and exciting their sensitive imaginations. I do not overlook the fact that the cancellation of the Treasury notes issued under the silver-purchasing act of 1890 would leave the Treasury in the actual ownership of sufficient silver, including seigniorage, to coin nearly $178,000,000 in standard dollars. It is worthy of consideration whether this might not from time to time be converted into dollars or fractional coin and slowly put into circulation, as in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury the necessities of the country should require. Whatever is attempted should be entered upon fully appreciating the fact that by careless, easy descent we have reached a dangerous depth, and that our ascent will not be accomplished without laborious toil and struggle. We shall be wise if we realize that we are financially ill and that our restoration to health may require heroic treatment and unpleasant remedies. In the present stage of our difficulty it is not easy to understand how the amount of our revenue receipts directly affects it. The important question is not the quantity of money received in revenue payments, but the kind of money we maintain and our ability to continue in sound financial condition. We are considering the Government's holdings of gold as related to the soundness of our money and as affecting our national credit and monetary strength. If our gold reserve had never been impaired; if no bonds had ever been issued to replenish it; if there had been no fear and timidity concerning our ability to continue gold payments; if any part of our revenues were now paid in gold, and if we could look to our gold receipts as a means of maintaining a safe reserve, the amount of our revenues would be an influential factor in the problem. But, unfortunately, all the circumstances that might lend weight to this consideration are entirely lacking. In our present predicament no gold is received by the Government in payment of revenue charges, nor would there be if the revenues were increased. The receipts of the Treasury, when not in silver certificates, consist of United States notes and Treasury notes issued for silver purchases. These forms of money are only useful to the Government in paying its current ordinary expenses, and its quantity in Government possession does not in the least contribute toward giving us that kind of safe financial standing or condition which is built on gold alone. If it is said that these notes if held by the Government can be used to obtain gold for our reserve, the answer is easy. The people draw gold from the Treasury on demand upon United States notes and Treasury notes, but the proposition that the Treasury can on demand draw gold from the people upon them would be regarded in these days with wonder and amusement; and even if this could be done there is nothing to prevent those thus parting with their gold from regaining it the next day or the next hour by the presentation of the notes they received in exchange for it. The Secretary of the Treasury might use such notes taken from a surplus revenue to buy gold in the market. Of course he could not do this without paying a premium. Private holders of gold, unlike the Government, having no parity to maintain, would not be restrained from making the best bargain possible when they furnished gold to the Treasury; but the moment the Secretary of the Treasury bought gold on any terms above par he would establish a general and universal premium upon it, thus breaking down the parity between gold and silver, which the Government is pledged to maintain, and opening the way to new and serious complications. In the meantime the premium would not remain stationary, and the absurd spectacle might be presented of a dealer selling gold to the Government and with United States notes or Treasury notes in his hand immediately clamoring for its return and a resale at a higher premium. It may be claimed that a large revenue and redundant receipts might favorably affect the situation under discussion by affording an opportunity of retaining these notes in the Treasury when received, and thus preventing their presentation for gold. Such retention to be useful ought to be at least measurably permanent; and this is precisely what is prohibited, so far as United States notes are concerned, by the law of 1878, forbidding their further retirement. That statute in so many words provides that these notes when received into the Treasury and belonging to the United States shall be ""paid out again and kept in circulation.""It will, moreover, be readily seen that the Government could not refuse to pay out United States notes and Treasury notes in current transactions when demanded, and insist on paying out silver alone, and still maintain the parity between that metal and the currency representing gold. Besides, the accumulation in the Treasury of currency of any kind exacted from the people through taxation is justly regarded as an evil, and it can not proceed far without vigorous protest against an unjustifiable retention of money from the business of the country and a denunciation of a scheme of taxation which proves itself to be unjust when it takes from the earnings and income of the citizen money so much in excess of the needs of Government support that large sums can be gathered and kept in the Treasury. Such a condition has heretofore in times of surplus revenue led the Government to restore currency to the people by the purchase of its unmatured bonds at a large premium and by a large increase of its deposits in national banks, and we easily remember that the abuse of Treasury accumulation has furnished a most persuasive argument in favor of legislation radically reducing our tariff taxation. Perhaps it is supposed that sufficient revenue receipts would in a sentimental way improve the situation by inspiring confidence in our solvency and allaying the fear of pecuniary exhaustion. And yet through all our struggles to maintain our gold reserve there never has been any apprehension as to our ready ability to pay our way with such money as we had, and the question whether or not our current receipts met our current expenses has not entered into the estimate of our solvency. Of course the general state of our funds, exclusive of gold, was entirely immaterial to the foreign creditor and investor. His debt could only be paid in gold, and his only concern was our ability to keep on hand that kind of money. On July 1, 1892, more than a year and a half before the first bonds were issued to replenish the gold reserve, there was a net balance in the Treasury, exclusive of such reserve, of less than $13,000,000, but the gold reserve amounted to more than $114,000,000, which was the quieting feature of the situation. It was when the stock of gold began rapidly to fall that fright supervened and our securities held abroad were returned for sale and debts owed abroad were pressed for payment. In the meantime extensive shipments of gold and other unfavorable indications caused restlessness and fright among our people at home. Thereupon the general state of our funds, exclusive of gold, became also immaterial to them, and they too drew gold from the Treasury for hoarding against all contingencies. This is plainly shown by the large increase in the proportion of gold withdrawn which was retained by our own people as time and threatening incidents progressed. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, nearly $85,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury and about $77,000,000 was sent abroad, while during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, over $117,000,000 was drawn out, of which only about $66,000,000 was shipped, leaving the large balance of such withdrawals to be accounted for by domestic hoarding. Inasmuch as the withdrawal of our gold has resulted largely from fright, there is nothing apparent that will prevent its continuance or recurrence, with its natural consequences, except such a change in our financial methods as will reassure the frightened and make the desire for gold less intense. It is not clear how an increase fix revenue, unless it be in gold, can satisfy those whose only anxiety is to gain gold from the Government's store. It can not, therefore, be safe to rely upon increased revenues as a cure for our present troubles. It is possible that the suggestion of increased revenue as a remedy for the difficulties we are considering may have originated in an intimation or distinct allegation that the bonds which have been issued ostensibly to replenish our gold reserve were really issued to supply insufficient revenue. Nothing can be further from the truth. Bonds were issued to obtain gold for the maintenance of our national credit. As has been shown, the gold thus obtained has been drawn again from the Treasury upon United States notes and Treasury notes. This operation would have been promptly prevented if possible; but these notes having thus been passed to the Treasury, they became the money of the Government, like any other ordinary Government funds, and there was nothing to do but to use them in paying Government expenses when needed. At no time when bonds have been issued has there been any consideration of the question of paying the expenses of Government with their proceeds. There was no necessity to consider that question. At the time of each bond issue we had a safe surplus in the Treasury for ordinary operations, exclusive of the gold in our reserve. In February, 1894, when the first issue of bonds was made, such surplus amounted to over $18,000,000; in November, when the second issue was made, it amounted to more than $42,000,000, and in February, 1895, when bonds for the third time were issued, such surplus amounted to more than $100,000,000. It now amounts to $98,072,420.30.Besides all this, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority whatever to issue bonds to increase the ordinary revenues or pay current expenses. I can not but think there has been some confusion of ideas regarding the effects of the issue of bonds and the results of the withdrawal of gold. It was the latter process, and not the former, that, by substituting in the Treasury United States notes and Treasury notes for gold, increased by their amount the money which was in the first instance subject to ordinary Government expenditure. Although the law compelling an increased purchase of silver by the Government was passed on the 14th day of July, 1890, withdrawals of gold from the Treasury upon the notes given in payment on such purchases did not begin until October, 1891. Immediately following that date the withdrawals upon both these notes and United States notes increased very largely, and have continued to such an extent that since the passage of that law there has been more than thirteen times as much gold taken out of the Treasury upon United States notes and Treasury notes issued for silver purchases as was thus withdrawn during the eleven and a half years immediately prior thereto and after the 1st day of January, 1879, when specie payments were resumed. It is neither unfair nor unjust to charge a large share of our present financial perplexities and dangers to the operation of the laws of 1878 and 1890 compelling the purchase of silver by the Government, which not only furnished a new Treasury obligation upon which its gold could be withdrawn, but so increased the fear of an overwhelming flood of silver and a forced descent to silver payments that even the repeal of these laws did not entirely cure the evils of their existence. While I have endeavored to make a plain statement of the disordered condition of our currency and the present dangers menacing our prosperity and to suggest a way which leads to a safer financial system, I have constantly had in mind the fact that many of my countrymen, whose sincerity I do not doubt, insist that the cure for the ills now threatening us may be found in the single and simple remedy of the free coinage of silver. They contend that our mints shall be at once thrown open to the free, unlimited, and independent coinage of both gold and silver dollars of full legal-tender quality, regardless of the action of any other government and in full view of the fact that the ratio between the metals which they suggest calls for 100 cents' worth of gold in the gold dollar at the present standard and only 50 cents in intrinsic worth of silver in the silver dollar. Were there infinitely stronger reasons than can be adduced for hoping that such action would secure for us a bimetallic currency moving on lines of parity, an experiment so novel and hazardous as that proposed might well stagger those who believe that stability is an imperative condition of sound money. No government, no human contrivance or act of legislation, has ever been able to hold the two metals together in free coinage at a ratio appreciably different from that which is established in the markets of the world. Those who believe that our independent free coinage of silver at an artificial ratio with gold of 16 to 1 would restore the parity between the metals, and consequently between the coins, oppose an unsupported and improbable theory to the general belief and practice of other nations; and to the teaching of the wisest statesmen and economists of the world, both in the past and present, and, what is far more conclusive, they run counter to our own actual experiences. Twice in our earlier history our lawmakers, in attempting to establish a bimetallic currency, undertook free coinage upon a ratio which accidentally varied from the actual relative values of the two metals not more than 3 per cent. In both cases, notwithstanding greater difficulties and cost of transportation than now exist, the coins whose intrinsic worth was undervalued. in the ratio gradually and surely disappeared from our circulation and went to other countries where their real value was better recognized. Acts of Congress were impotent to create equality where natural causes decreed even a slight inequality. Twice in our recent history we have signally failed to raise by legislation the value of silver. Under an act of Congress passed in 1878 the Government was required for more than twelve years to expend annually at least $24,000,000 in the purchase of silver bullion for coinage. The act of July 14, 1890, in a still bolder effort, increased the amount of silver the Government was compelled to purchase and forced it to become the buyer annually of 54,000,000 ounces, or practically the entire product of our mines. Under both laws silver rapidly and steadily declined in value. The prophecy and the expressed hope and expectation of those in the Congress who led in the passage of the last-mentioned act that it would reestablish and maintain the former parity between the two metals are still fresh in our memory. In the light of these experiences, which accord with the experiences of other nations, there is certainly no secure ground for the belief that an act of Congress could now bridge an inequality of 50 per cent between gold and silver at our present ratio, nor is there the least possibility that our country, which has less than one-seventh of the silver money in the world, could by its action alone raise not only our own but all silver to its lost ratio with gold. Our attempt to accomplish this by the free coinage of silver at a ratio differing widely from actual relative values would be the signal for the complete departure of gold from our circulation, the immediate and large contraction of our circulating medium, and a shrinkage in the real value and monetary efficiency of all other forms of currency as they settled to the level of silver monometallism. Everyone who receives a fixed salary and every worker for wages would find the dollar in his hand ruthlessly scaled down to the point of bitter disappointment, if not to pinching privation. A change in our standard to silver monometallism would also bring on a collapse of the entire system of credit, which, when based on a standard which is recognized and adopted by the world of business, is many times more potent and useful than the entire volume of currency and is safely capable of almost indefinite expansion to meet the growth of trade and enterprise. In a self-invited struggle through darkness and uncertainty our humiliation would be increased by the consciousness that we had parted company with all the enlightened and progressive nations of the world and were desperately and hopelessly striving to meet the stress of modern commerce and competition with a debased and unsuitable currency and in association with the few weak and laggard nations which have silver alone as their standard of value. All history warns us against rash experiments which threaten violent changes in our monetary standard and the degradation of our currency. The past is full of lessons teaching not only the economic dangers but the national immorality that follow in the train of such experiments. I will not believe that the American people can be persuaded after sober deliberation to jeopardize their nation's prestige and proud standing by encouraging financial nostrums, nor that they will yield to the false allurements of cheap money when they realize that it must result in the weakening of that financial integrity and rectitude which thus far in our history has been so devotedly cherished as one of the traits of true Americanism. Our country's indebtedness, whether owing by the Government or existing between individuals, has been contracted with reference to our present standard. To decree by act of Congress that these debts shall be payable in less valuable dollars than those within the contemplation and intention of the parties when contracted would operate to transfer by the fiat of law and without compensation an amount of property and a volume of rights and interests almost incalculable. Those who advocate a blind and headlong plunge to free coinage in the name of bimetallism, and professing the belief, contrary to all experience, that we could thus establish a double standard and a concurrent circulation of both metals in our coinage, are certainly reckoning from a cloudy standpoint. Our present standard of value is the standard of the civilized world and permits the only bimetallism now possible, or at least that is within the independent reach of any single nation, however powerful that nation may be. While the value of gold as a standard is steadied by almost universal commercial and business use, it does not despise silver nor seek its banishment. Wherever this standard is maintained there is at its side in free and unquestioned circulation a volume of silver currency sometimes equaling and sometimes even exceeding it in amount both maintained at a parity notwithstanding a depreciation or fluctuation in the intrinsic value of silver. There is a vast difference between a standard of value and a currency for monetary use. The standard must necessarily be fixed and certain. The currency may be in divers forms and of various kinds. No silver-standard country has a gold currency in circulation, but an enlightened and wise system of finance secures the benefits of both gold and silver as currency and circulating medium by keeping the standard stable and all other currency at par with it. Such a system and such a standard also give free scope for the use and expansion of safe and conservative credit, so indispensable to broad and growing commercial transactions and so well substituted for the actual use of money. If a fixed and stable standard is maintained, such as the magnitude and safety of our commercial transactions and business require, the use of money itself is conveniently minimized. Every dollar of fixed and stable value has through the agency of confident credit an astonishing capacity of multiplying itself in financial work. Every unstable and fluctuating dollar fails as a basis of credit, and in its use begets gambling speculation and undermines the foundations of honest enterprise. I have ventured to express myself on this subject with earnestness and plainness of speech because I can not rid myself of the belief that there lurk in the proposition for the free coinage of silver, so strongly approved and so enthusiastically advocated by a multitude of my countrymen, a serious menace to our prosperity and an insidious temptation of our people to wander from the allegiance they owe to public and private integrity. It is because I do not distrust the good faith and sincerity of those who press this scheme that I have imperfectly but with zeal submitted my thoughts upon this momentous subject. I can not refrain from begging them to reexamine their views and beliefs in the light of patriotic reason and familiar experience and to weigh again and again the consequences of such legislation as their efforts have invited. Even the continued agitation of the subject adds greatly to the difficulties of a dangerous financial situation already forced upon us. In conclusion I especially entreat the people's representatives in the Congress, who are charged with the responsibility of inaugurating measures for the safety and prosperity of our common country, to promptly and effectively consider the ills of our critical financial plight. I have suggested a remedy which my judgment approves. I desire, however, to assure the Congress that I am prepared to cooperate with them in perfecting any other measure promising thorough and practical relief, and that I will gladly labor with them in every patriotic endeavor to further the interests and guard the welfare of our countrymen, whom in our respective places of duty we have undertaken to serve.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-11-07,"In one day, we are going to win the great state of Pennsylvania and we are going to take back the White House.
This election will decide whether we're ruled by a corrupt political class or whether we are ruled by yourselves, the people. It is time to reject a failed political elite that has bled this country dry.
To all the people of Pennsylvania, I say, we are going to put the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers back to work. We're bringing our companies back.
The trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the country. I want to take this moment to share a message with all of the Democratic voters in our country, thirsting -- thirsting for change. You're tired of a government that works only for Wall Street and the special interests.
You're tired of the reckless foreign policy. The crazy wars that are never won. Hillary Clinton is the last stand for the Wall Street and special interest donors and to special interests themselves. And Hillary is the face of failure -- she's the face of failure. She's the face of failed foreign policy.
Real change begins -- she is indeed the face of failure. Look at what she's done with e-mails, look at the mess -- look at the mess, and look at the corruption. Real change begins immediately with the repealing and replacing of the disaster known as Obamacare.
This is a great room. We had great victories in this room by the way.
Great victories in this room.
And I went to school in Pennsylvania. And my kids went to school in Pennsylvania. So, I guess we assume it's a good place to learn. Look, have you been seeing the polls by the way?
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. See the dishonest people back there, the media. The totally dishonest group.
They are so dishonest folks. You can't even read articles in certain papers anymore.
We're doing fantastically well in North Carolina, I think we're leading. We -- I believe -- are leading in Florida.
And now, Hillary just announced she's going to additional stops. She's going to Michigan, traditionally not really a Republican state. But you know, I've been talking, I was man of the year in Michigan a number of years ago. And I started telling and talking about your car business is being stolen from you. I've been saying it for years and years and years. And you know what? Michigan now agrees. We're leading in Michigan -- we're leading.
And when I heard that crooked Hillary is going there tonight, she had to. Nobody thought in terms of Michigan. When I heard I figured, you know what? I have nothing to do tonight, so I'll go there tonight and give it the last word. OK.
So after this, I'm going to New Hampshire, and then I'm going to Michigan. Oh, we're going to have a great victory tomorrow folks, we're going to have a great victory.
They have no idea -- the dishonest media has no idea. Actually, they do have an idea. They're saying, what is going on? And look at these people and look at this enthusiasm, there's nothing like it. By the way, and just I have to say, this is considered -- the history of this country. This is actually -- and you've been hearing it. This is considered the greatest movement, nobody's ever seen anything like this folks.
. Where we give them $400 million in cash, but that turns out to be $1.7 billion in cash to Iran, for hostages.
For hostages, which our president lied about.
Boy oh boy. And she can't get anybody to go to her rallies, so she gets Jay-Z.
He uses the worst language I have ever heard. And by the time he's finished, what's happened? What happens, he and Beyonce right? They're finished, by that time most of the people have left. So she thinks she's getting people, by the time she speaks they're all gone anyways. She should just take a small room and talk, -- just take a small room and talk.
It's just been announced that the residents of Pennsylvania are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. So high that I won't tell you what it is, it's very high. All 67 counties in Pennsylvania, most of which I won in the primaries, right.
Almost all, almost everyone of them. Are losing Obamacare insurance next year, that puts you in a bad position. But the truth is, it's not going to matter. Because we are going to repeal it and replace it -- not going to matter, don't worry about it.
So you can leave here happy. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, and deductibles are going through the roof. Yet, crooked Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive than it is right now.
I'm asking for your vote, so we can repeal and replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Pennsylvania.
Real change also means restoring honesty to our government.
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States.
. And part of the rigged system is the dishonest media, believe me. They're rigging the system.
True, it's true. Don't worry, they never show the crowds folks, they never -- they show my face, boom boom -- never show the crowd. It took over a year for the FBI to review 50,000 e-mails and then just eight days they reviewed 650,000 e-mails.
So now, it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box tomorrow. You've got to get out and vote.
Let's swamp them. Pennsylvania, let's swamp them. You've got to get out.
Our country has never, ever done anything like they're doing right now when it comes to justice. James Cartwright, four star general, two weeks ago, admitted to one mistake. And he did it on the basis of national security he said, and I can understand that. He may go to jail for up to five years. General Petraeus's life has been destroyed for doing one, one hundredth of what Hillary Clinton did.
So sad, so sad. It's -- honestly it's a disgrace. And now she's allowed to run for President. And General Cartwright will end up being in jail.
My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take back our country from the special interests and the donor.
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words from all of us. When we win tomorrow we are going to Washington, D.C. to drain the swamp.
They say we're tied in Pennsylvania, I don't think so -- I don't think so. I think we're going to blow them out tomorrow in a lot of different ways, blow them out.
No way. This is not the sound of a second place finisher, that I can tell you.
No, they have us tied. Don't forget we were 12 points down three weeks ago. And then after the debates, all of a sudden we started going up. We started going up and it was great. And now they have us even. But I actually think we're much better than that in Pennsylvania, I do -- and so do you.
Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of it's manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. A deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by his lovely wife, Hillary Clinton.
America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs finally from leaving Pennsylvania. We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on those products.
And you know what's going to happen? They're not going to leave. And if they do, that's OK. The country will make a lot of money. But they're not going to leave -- they're not going to leave. Now, your politicians could have thought of that, some of them, some of them can't, for they have other problems. We will renegotiate NAFTA, one of the worst deals, probably the -- not probably -- the single worst trade deal ever made in the history of this world, it's true.
We'll stand up to China, and stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Hillary Clinton wants. You know, she called it the gold standard and then she lied during the debate. And she said, I never said that, I said, yes you did, you called it the gold standard. Turned out she was lying -- turned out.
Of course you could look at it differently. It is the gold standard for the other side, not for the United States, for the other side it's good. How about this -- how about this? How about getting the questions for the debate.
They fed her -- illegally, they fed her the questions for the debate, Donna Brazile. They fed her the questions to the debate. And she never came and...
They fed her the questions to the debate. And she didn't say, I can't do this, I'm sorry, it's so unethical. Can you imagine if I was given the questions to the debate? What would have happened? The biggest story all over the -- you don't even read this. You read a little bit about Donna Brazile, but you don't read this. They gave her the questions to debates, numerous debates against Bernie Sanders.
And Bernie Sanders, he is really upset, I would bet you he would wish that he didn't give her that little nod, because he made a deal with the devil, you know it. He ruined the legacy -- he really had a very important legacy going folks. He ruined his legacy when he did that. And he's got to be very embarrassed -- he's got to be very, very embarrassed.
And we will massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people -- the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country. We will massively lower taxes. It's in our plan. And I'll tell you. Hillary, you see her plan. She is going to raise taxes substantially folks.
We're the highest taxed nation in the world. She's going to raise taxes. Figure that one out....
You folks can't be too happy about that I guess. We are going to unleash an energy revolution right here in Pennsylvania. We will cancel billions of dollars in global warming payments to the United Nations, billions and billions and billions.
And use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.
And we will put our miners back to work and we will put our steel workers back to work -- they're going back to work. We will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community, living in the inner city, have been treated very unfairly. Crime that is so bad, and I say it, you can't sometimes walk to a store, you get shot. We are going to fix our inner cities. We're going to bring back jobs.
We're going to bring back safety. We're going to bring education to the inner cities. And I say, because there's such unbelievable potential in terms of people within our inner cities. And I say, honestly folks, what do you have to lose? It's so bad now. What do you have to lose.
And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Florida and other places. The African-American community likes Donald Trump and they're not liking voting for Hillary Clinton very much.
They're not showing up, they don't want to vote for her. The Hispanic community, the numbers are becoming great. You know the Cubans, they gave me an award, Bay of Pigs award, last week. The entire Cuban community of Miami, Bay of Pigs Association. No, but a lot of trends are very disturbing to the media.
And my numbers with the African-American community are -- I knew that was going to happen, I knew it. But we're going to fix the inner cities.
Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
Have not choice.
We have no choice.
A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a great wall.
Are you ready.
And, who is going to pay for that wall?
100 percent correct, they will. They have -- unbelievable how they've done with our country. I was with the president of Mexico, three months ago -- terrific, it was a terrific meeting. But you know, when you have highways going into a country, it's got to be like a two way highway. Right now, they get all the jobs, they get all the factories and plants, they get all the income, they get all the money, the taxes. We get unemployment and we get drugs, we get nothing.
We get nothing. That will all change folks. It will change very, very fast. And it will be -- it will be a two lane highway, maybe a one -- maybe one lane for a little while, but one way coming here -- but just for a little while. We have to catch up, this is a lot years. A lot of years we've been abused by people who don't know what they're doing. A lot of years, we've been abused by stupid politicians, very stupid politicians. There goes your country. And your plan gives your Social Security and Medicare benefits -- you know, she wants to give them to illegal immigrants.
We're going to take care of our veterans folks -- we're going to take care of our veterans.
. They come back again, 10 years. Believe me, nobody's coming back. OK.
We will cancel all Federal funding to sanctuary cities.
. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense Sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military.
This will be a national effort. And it means a new future for Philadelphia's Navy shipyard. Right.
I know it well, I went to school in Philadelphia, I know it well. It's going to be activated again, really activated. I'm honored to have the endorsement of more than 200 top admirals and generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients, and the list is growing.
The list is growing rapidly. And they told me on Mosul, the other night I was in Fort Bragg -- right near Fort Bragg. We had 25,000, 27,000 people in a field, it was unbelievable. And some of the generals and admirals came up to me -- we had a lot of them there. They said, Mr. Trump, you are so right on Mosul, you're so right. You know, I've been saying, the element of surprise. Because we are going to get the leaders of ISIS who are in Mosul. Well you have to understand, they've already left when you said the four months right.
We will be going into Mosul in one week, these people are so stupid. The element of surprise. The great General Douglas McArthur, right? Spinning -- spinning in his grave. The great General George Patton, can you imagine what they must be? Let's assume they could actually see what's happening -- maybe they are? Can you imagine what they must be thinking.
Oh boy folks. We're gonna have such a different country -- you're going to be so proud of your country again.
Going to be so proud.
. They're having a very hard time right now. The leaders and the people have gone. And the other fighters are entrenched, and it's much more difficult than they thought, because of that. But the generals said, you are so right on that Mr. Trump, you're so right.
Hillary and our failed establishment have dragged us into foreign wars that have made up less safe and never end -- they never end. That will all change when we win the presidential election.
Because from now on, it's going to be America first -- America first.
Is everybody going to vote tomorrow?
Get your family, get your friends. No matter what you do, you've got to get out and vote. The whole world is laughing at us. They're laughing at what's going on in our country. With China, almost $500 billion trade deficit, who negotiates these deals? You know who negotiates them, political hacks. Political hacks dealing against the toughest, smartest people, that have been trained to, they've been trained to do nothing but this, they laugh at the stupidity of our country.
But you know what? We have the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest business people in the world. We're going to use these great business people -- Carl Ichan endorsed me, so many others. We're going to use our great leaders, our great business people, it's time -- it's time. To all American's I say it's time for change, it's time for leadership.
In summing up, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration, we are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, Hillary's going to raise your taxes. She's going to raise your taxes. We are going to protect your Social Security and Medicare, and you know what Hillary's going to do.
We will rebuild our badly depleted military. And we are going to finally take care of our great veterans.
Provide school choice and put an end to common core, we're bringing education local.
And appoint justices to the United State Supreme Court, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
I can't believe I'm saying this. It started on June 16th, last year, June 16th. It's a long time -- thank you, I love you too darling. We're going to be brought together. Just imagine what our country could accomplish by working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.
Wouldn't it be nice? I'm asking you to dream big. We are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. You've got to go out and vote. Get everybody to vote.
It will be the greatest vote you've ever cast in your lifetime. Because together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And yes, we will make America great again.
Thank you, everybody.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Scranton, PA",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-scranton-pa-november-7-2016
Lindsay Hoyle,United Kingdom,2019-12-19,"Colleagues, I want to begin this Session by marking the terrorist attack in London on 29 November during which Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt lost their lives. I am sure the whole House will join with me in sending our condolences to their families.
The House has directed the Speaker to make a statement at the beginning of each Session about the duties and responsibilities of hon. Members. I begin by reminding hon. Members of their duty to observe the code of conduct agreed by the House and to behave with civility and fairness in all their dealings. We all have duties to our constituents, but we are also part of a wider parliamentary community. I consider it essential that all hon. Members, both new and returning, undertake the Valuing Everyone training. The behaviour code applies to Members as it applies to others who visit or work in Parliament, and provides clear guidance. Unacceptable behaviour will be dealt with seriously, independently and with effective sanctions.
The House asserts its privilege of freedom of speech. It is there to ensure that our constituents can be represented by us without fear or favour. It is an obligation upon us all to exercise that privilege responsibly. Members must be mindful of the impact of what they say, not only on other Members but on others who follow our proceedings, and Members should be heard courteously, whatever their views. That privilege is enjoyed by Members of Parliament only in their work in this House: as private individuals, we are equal under the law with those whom we represent.
Parliament should be open to those whom it represents. We should seek to explain its work to those who elect us and to make them welcome here. The security of this building and those who work and visit here depends upon us all. We have a duty to be vigilant and to assist those whose job it is to maintain this place as a safe place to work.
Before moving to the first business of the new Parliament, I would like to express my very best wishes to all hon. Members, those newly elected and those returning, and all those who work in this House.
Outlawries Bill
A Bill for the more effectual preventing Clandestine Outlawries was read the First time, and ordered to be read a Second time.
Chairman and Deputy Chairmen
Ordered,
That, for the period up to the first sitting day following the election of the Deputy Speakers under Standing Order No. 2A, Sir Roger Gale be Chairman of Ways and Means, Sir George Howarth be First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and Sir Gary Streeter be Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means.
",2019 Speaker’s Statement,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/lindsay-hoyle-2019-speakers-statement/
Peter Aldous,United Kingdom,2020-02-01,"It is an honour to follow my hon.
The main provision of the Bill is to enshrine in law the Government’s commitment to increase NHS spending by at least £34 billion by 2023-24. Some may say that this is just gesture politics, but it provides the NHS with the certainty that it needs to make long-term plans and strategic investment in front-line services. This contrasts with operating on a hand-to-mouth short-term basis, as it has often done in the past.
If this approach is successful, then in future, as suggested by the King’s Fund, the Government should look at pursuing this approach with other items of health spending, such as capital investment, public health and staff and education training. It is one of these latter items that I wish to highlight—investment in NHS buildings and infrastructure, which is so important in providing a high-quality environment for patients and health professionals.
As well as making commitments to revenue funding, the Government have undertaken to invest in hospital buildings—six new hospitals now and seedcorn funding to work up the plans for 38 more such developments. One of the latter is the James Paget Hospital on the Lowestoft Road in Gorleston in the constituency of my right hon. The James Paget serves his and my constituencies as well as part of that of my right hon.
The James Paget is at the heart of our local health economy, and thus this investment is extremely welcome. I understand that the seedcorn funding is due to be paid over to the hospital very shortly, and that it is already mapping out its plans for the future. It has moved quickly since the announcement of the seedcorn funding was made in the autumn. Its board, liaising with the Great Yarmouth and Waveney clinical commissioning group and the Norfolk and Waveney sustainability and transformation plans, is working up its development plans. Although at an early stage, these include developing a health and social care campus, encompassing acute community primary care, mental health and care facilities, it also wishes to expand its education training, investing in its health and care staff, and also to improve its digital services.​
As the plans for the James Paget are worked up, it is important to have in mind three requirements. First, it is important that the needs of the people who use the hospital are taken fully into account. Ours is an area with an ageing population that places pressure on local health services. In Lowestoft and Yarmouth, there are deep pockets of deprivation with serious inequalities, which must be addressed. We are a popular tourism area, which puts additional demands on the hospital and its services.
Once the James Paget has fully worked up its provisional plans, a wide-ranging and full public consultation should take place so that the views of local people can be fully considered.
Secondly, while the board of the James Paget is taking the lead in working up the redevelopment plans, it is important that all those involved in health and social care services in the area have their say as we, quite rightly, move towards an integrated health and social care system in which all those involved collaborate and work together. The James Paget recognises this, and doctors, mental health and social care professionals, the CCG, the mental health trust and the county and district councils must be fully involved, as well as the voluntary sector and patient representative groups. Thankfully, the silo mentality of the past is gradually being knocked down.
Thirdly, attracting health and medical staff to the Waveney and Great Yarmouth area continues to be a challenge. The redevelopment of the James Paget provides an exciting opportunity to address that by providing centres of excellence in specialisms for which there is a need in the area. The importance of working with the University of East Anglia and the University of Suffolk cannot be underestimated. The former has a medical and health science faculty that includes the Norwich medical school, which provides clinical rotations at both the Norfolk and Norwich and the James Paget hospitals. There is also a science faculty that includes biological science and pharmacy courses. The University of Suffolk, which is more recently established, includes a school of health sciences, which has courses in adult nursing, mental health nursing and radiography, and postgraduate courses in public health nursing and advanced clinical practice. It would be great if in future more of those courses could be delivered on the Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth campuses of East Coast College.
The seedcorn funding for the James Paget is extremely welcome. We now need to ensure that the hospital’s redevelopment takes place in a timely manner and that bespoke, high-quality facilities are provided for local people that meet their needs. By doing that, we can ensure that we have a resilient district general hospital serving the Waveney and Great Yarmouth area for many years to come.
",2020 Speech on the NHS Funding Bill,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/peter-aldous-2020-speech-on-the-nhs-funding-bill/
Mike DeWine,United States of America,2020-08-13,"Well good afternoon. Afternoon everyone. Today I’m wearing a tie from Terra State Community College in Fremont. Terra State offers more than 60 degrees and certificates and has been educating students now for more than 50 years. We just learned that the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections has experienced a tragedy. Today at around 10:00 a.m., the Corrections Reception Center received notification Dr. Craig Cullen of Lakewood was killed. The incident is unrelated to COVID and is under investigation by the Lakewood, Ohio Police Department. Dr. Cullen graduated from Harvard and UCLA and retired lieutenant colonel for the U.S. Army. A ten-year employee for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections. I am told that his work ethic and dedication to his job and to people was unparalleled. 80 years old, 80 years old he drove from Lakewood to the Correction Receptions Center in Orient, a long, long ways, every day, a four hour roundtrip. Our deepest condolences go out to his loved ones and to those who work with him.
Well we’ve talked for many months about what happens when someone gets COVID-19 and our doctors and our medical authorities are continuing to learn more every single day. American Journal of Cardiology published an analysis last month that addresses the impact of coronavirus on the heart and so we thought we would look at this a little bit today through the eyes of an expert. This issue also came up this week and some news accounts involving the Big 10’s decision not to have fall sports. So there’s been stories in the media in regard to that.
Ohio State has been routinely testing their athletes as part of their protocol, so today I’d like to introduce Dr. Curt Daniels who is a cardiologist, is going to share what they’ve been seeing at Ohio State about COVID’s effects on individuals and also specifically on athletes. Dr. Daniels is director of the adolescent and adult congenital heart disease program and professor of clinical internal medicine in pediatrics at the Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Dr. Daniels specializes in congenital heart disease in sports cardiology. Dr. Daniels, thank you very much for joining us.
Well Doctor, I wonder if you can just kind of tell us a little bit about what we know now in regard to the coronavirus and what impact it does have or might have on someone who has the coronavirus?
Doctor, thanks for that explanation and so do we know how often someone who has coronavirus, it impacts their heart? Do we have any data on that yet or not?
Now Doctor, I know you and I talked last night and I know you were involved in monitoring some of the athletes. You have described what I would call kind of a vigorous protocol in regard to testing and so I wonder with the athletes, and so I wonder if you maybe can describe for us without obviously using any names or giving big numbers or anything or small numbers but just kind of describe what you all have learned during that period of time.
So just so I understand and our viewers understand Doctor, you talk about 10 to 13%. Is that 10 to 13% of those athletes, young men and women, who actually tested positive? So is 10 to 13% of those who test positive for the coronavirus had this myocarditis?
In those cases, what was the range on that? Were those mostly mild or how were they?
I wonder if you could describe … Let’s take this obviously beyond the setting of Ohio State and Ohio State athletes that were being tested and you all were monitoring but let’s take it out into the world of high school athletes but also for anybody who might want to run, 25 years old, 30 years old, and they came down with the coronavirus. What should they watch for if they know that they’ve had the virus and are coming out of the virus in regard to the heart?
So let’s say … Let’s just make up a case. Let’s say there’s a 30-year-old or a 15-year-old, either one, who has been diagnosed, who has been tested and found to have coronavirus. They come out of that, they feel better. Is there a protocol that should be followed in regard to specifically their heart? Maybe stay focused on this.
Is there any kind of clearance … You and I talked last night maybe about a clearance protocol. Do you have any additional comments about that?
Giving people guidance, I know the best advice is to see their own doctor but we do have people watching this and you have an opportunity to kind of talk to them, so is there anything else as far as clearance before they go back and go run their five miles or whatever they’re going to do?
Good. Doctor. Thanks for coming. Thanks for sharing this information with us. We appreciate it very much.
Eric, we’ll go look at the data slides right now. Our first one is kind of our regular slide, our key indicators. Cases have gone down. They’ve been hovering around 1,200. The day before yesterday was higher, yesterday is 1,178 cases. That’s a little bit below the 21 day average but really kind of hovering right there. 21 deaths, 122 hospitalizations, that is up a little bit and ICU admissions is up a little bit as well.
Eric, we’ll go to the next one. We continue to rank our counties. This is updated from Tuesday by highest occurrence and remember the way we do this, we’re trying to compare apples to apples and trying to adjust and we do adjust for population by county, so what we’re trying to see is what is the intensity during the last two weeks of the COVID spread and COVID cases in the county and so Eric, why don’t you … Let’s go over to our top 10. A little easier to read. If you go through the rest of the list, you do see Lucas, a bigger county, and Franklin, but you also see Perry County, Meigs County and Seneca County as well as Fairfield, smaller counties. So this is just one more way to look at it. Again, it is not a long historical look back. It is a look back for the last two weeks and of course every day these numbers change a little bit as we go back for the 14 days but again it gives you one other way besides the color to look at what’s going on in the area where you live.
Eric, let’s take a look at the next one. Our Ohio National Guard continues to go around the state and do what we call popup testing, testing for one day, going into a community. You’ll see this week, had the opportunity to be in Cincinnati, Gallia County, Athens County, Cincinnati and Dayton. Next week, much more busier schedule. Bucyrus, Cincinnati, Dayton, Avon Lake, Cincinnati, Youngstown, Avon Lake again, Lima, Cincinnati, Warren and Middletown and so again if you have in your community, if you believe that there is additional testing that needs to be done, the National Guard can come in and do that testing.
Eric, let’s go to our color map again. This is a new map for today and let me kind of go through this. This week we have 12 red counties. Three new counties have turned red since last week, the new counties, two of them are in Southwest Ohio, Clermont County again. They had at one time been red, they are now red again. Brown County, again Southwest Ohio and then over in the eastern part Muskingum County. Remaining as red counties this week are Cuyahoga, Erie, Fairfield, Franklin, Licking, Lucas, Marion, Mercer and Montgomery County. Seven of our red counties met fewer than four indicators but are still designated as red. This is because they are above 100,000, more than 100 cases of coronavirus per 100,000 in the past two weeks. That is the measure. Under additional cases, coronavirus per 100,000 in the past two weeks.
Have some good news. Allen and Medina Counties are no longer red and so we congratulate them and just ask everyone to continue to wear the mask and do what they need to do to keep that down. Allen County dropped two indicators, they fell off the list from high incidence counties based on the CDC’s definition. Medina County also moved from the red alert to orange, they are no longer meeting the emergency department indicator which is an early indicator. Nine counties have dropped from orange to yellow, they are Adams, Defiance, Fulton, Henry, Knox, Lake, Paulding, Pike and Williams. Let’s talk a little bit about the red counties. We’ll start in Southern Ohio, Southeast Ohio with Brown County. It’s red for the first time. 21% of their cases throughout this pandemic have occurred in the last two weeks, one-fifth. While they’ve had a couple of outbreaks the number of cases linked to those outbreaks has been low which indicates significant community spread throughout the county. Clermont County. We saw cases increases throughout June with about 120 cases a week in early July. This was followed by good news, the community was just starting to see those cases come down as we move through July down to under 80 new cases in the third week of July. However, the last two weeks, we’re seeing cases creep back up. The last seven days of July had 101 cases. In addition to cases going up, we’re also seeing increases in healthcare use for patients with COVID-19. Cuyahoga County. They continue their steady decrease in daily number of cases reported. They are at 102, so if they get below 100, they will move out of the red area, so very good news there. The county reports some outbreaks in longterm care facilities and group homes. Erie County. Erie is red because they meet the CDC’s threshold for high incidence. Again, high incidence is above 100. They are at 105 cases per 100,000
… they’re at 105 cases per 100,000 residents in the past two weeks. They have gone down and that is good news.
Fairfield County. They are above 100, they’re at 114. While the County had slightly fewer new cases during the past week, their numbers remain elevated.
Franklin County also continues as red this week because they meet the CDC definition for high incidents. Their cases are in fact dropping, but they’re still at 126. Now they dropped from 142 to 126 per capita.
Licking County. Still meets the CDC’s has definition for high incidents, which get them red this week. The only met two other indicators; cases per capita and percentage of cases in non congregate settings.
Lucas County. 159 cases per 100,000 residents. Of course, they meet the definition of being over 100/.
Marion County meets the CDC’s definition for high incidents. They are at 101, so they’re right on the line there, but they’re close to dropping off that. So we hope by next week, Marion County cases will have eased down and Marion County will no longer be red.
Mercer County, again, as we said at 298 cases. Way above anybody else. And that’s the news there, unfortunately. So significant community spread is taking place.
Montgomery County. Cases per 100,000 down to 94. That’s been an improvement, but they still remain red this week. While they no longer meet the CDC threshold for high incidents, they meet four other indicators. They’re one of two counties that had increases in both their emergency department and outpatient visits during this reporting period. Not good news, because what that means is those are the early, early warning signs that cases are going to start to creep up. So that’s not good.
Muskingum County, as we said, first week as red. They are at 62 cases per 100,000, but they have other indicators that put them in this category. Again, for them, outpatient visits grew from an average of four visits on August 3rd and nine on August 10th. So that percentage of cases increase is certainly not good.
We’ve tried to share some stories about how the virus has spreads. Let me just share a few. In Clark County a group of friends got together to play cards at a friends home. Now, sadly, seven individuals are in fact, testing positive. We’re also continuing to see small workplace outbreaks where one member of the staff spreads it to a group of coworkers. In some of these cases, the businesses have had to close for cleaning or for staffing. We’ve seen this in New Philadelphia and we’ve seen it in Dayton and we’ve seen it in other parts of Montgomery County as well.
We’re going to continue to share these stories. Again, not to be critical of anyone, but rather just to explain that these cases are spreading in just kind of common everyday occurrences when people let their guard down, don’t wear a mask, don’t do the social distancing. And they can occur among friends, they can occur among family members.
Eric, let’s go back to another map. And I’ve asked our data team to kind of combine something from the Ohio Department of Education and the Ohio Department of Health. And so if you will look at the map that is up now, and particularly the one that’s on your left, this is kind of an overlay map. And what we have done where you see counties in red, with the red outline, those are counties that this week are red. Some have been red for awhile, some just became red. But these are our red counties this week. Overlaid inside of that, or laid inside of that, is the Department of Education’s map in regard to which schools are coming back in-person. So let’s start with the darkest color on there, see how good my eyesight is, but I would call it dark blue maybe. Dark blue is fully remote. So these are the school districts that we know of right now that have decided to be fully remote.
The blue, what I would call the light blue, is hybrid, which means they’re coming back partially in school and partially remote. And the ones that are coming back full time, their plan is to come back full time, that’s sort of a green, if I can read that correctly. And the only point is for everybody from those areas to look … I had some conversations with some superintendents last week, I’m going to have some more conversations this week. And every school is making its own decision about whether to come back and which way to come back. We’ve had a long tradition in this state of local schools making their own decisions, families making their own decisions, school boards making their own decisions.
But if you look back at the map for a moment, Eric, those that are red and are coming back in-person, that is a challenge. And it’s really, it’s a challenge, not so much to the educators, because I, after talking to a lot of superintendents and principals and teachers, I think they’re going to do a bang up job to do everything they can to keep your children safe or your grandchildren safe when they go back in school. But I’m pointing this map out kind of for us, for people in the community. We have a job to do. And our job to do is to slow down the spread in the community so the school can either open or the school can stay open. And I just put these counties up because these are the red counties, these the ones that we’re seeing right now with the most spread. But it’s important, it’s an important principle, I think, for all of us, whether we’re a yellow county, whether a red county, whether an orange county. And that is we have an obligation to do everything we can to slow down the spread in our community so our kids can go to school, our grandkids could go to school, they can play sports and they can do all the other things that we want them to do, and the things that we want them to get out of the school. On August 4th we announced that we’re going to make an order in regard to kids in grades K through 12 to wear face coverings. I know I’ve talked to some superintendents who’ve asked me when are we going to put that up. It’s coming up today. So the mask order for all our educators and parents, coronavirus.ohio.gov, that is coming up.
Let me now turn to a very important topic of minority health and issues of disparity. In April, we formed a minority health strike force to focus on the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on our minority communities in Ohio. The group’s mission is evolved over the past few months to examine broader health disparities and racial injustices. Today the group has released its final report. And I want to thank the members of the strike force for their hard work, their passion, their commitment to shedding light on the health disparities disproportionately affecting people of color in Ohio. It is wrong that in Ohio today, the overall life expectancy of African Americans Ohioans is four years shorter than of white Ohioans. It’s wrong that African American Ohioans have a higher rate of heart disease, higher rates of hypertension and diabetes. It’s wrong that our African American citizens are two and a half times more likely to live in poverty, and African American children in Ohio are three times more likely to live in poverty than their white brothers and sisters.
The coronavirus has further laid bare the disparities. African Americans, who today make up about 14% of Ohio’s population, represent 25%, 25%, of positive COVID-19 cases, 32% of COVID-19 hospitalizations, and 19% of COVID 19 deaths. At least 6% of the people who have tested positive for the virus in Ohio are Latino, although they make up less than 4% of the state’s population. We have to do better. We can do better. My inaugural address as governor, I laid out the ideals that would guide our administration. The values, the principles that serve as a foundation for what we try to do every single day. At that time, in my inaugural address, I said everyone, no matter where they were born or who their parents are, deserves a chance to succeed, a chance to get a good paying job, a chance to raise a family, a chance to live their version, whatever that is, of the American dream. Now to truly make change we need an equitable healthcare system. We need thriving communities. We need improvements in quality of life. These are things that our health experts call the social determinants of health. Things that make up a big proportion of determining how well we’re going to do and whether we’re going to be well throughout our lifetime. The Minority Health Strike Force’s final report offers 34 recommendations on the topics of dismantling racism, removing obstacles to public health, improving the social and economic environment, improving the physical environment and strengthening data collection to better track disparities.
I asked my senior leadership team, I asked my members of the cabinet, to read this report, and they have done so. I’ve asked them not just to read it, but to lay out a plan where they, in the world they occupy, in the position they occupy, can do better with their own employees, but also do better in whatever mission they have as a member of our cabinet. In response today, we are issuing Ohio’s Executive Response, a plan of action to advance equity. Let me pull this up. This is what it looks like. You’ll have chance to pull this down on online. This is our administration’s action plan. It’s the beginning, it’s not an end. But it’s trying to put, in writing, some of the things that we believe we can do, that we can do to change things for the better.
It doesn’t mean it’s the end product. It’s the beginning. We started when I was sworn in, but this puts some things in writing and says, “These are some additional things that we’re going to do,” and it will be a work in progress and we will continue on that throughout the duration of our administration. Because it really is true. All of us, all of us can do more. I’ll just give you a few examples. Today I’m challenging our colleges and universities, and we’ve got some great ones in Ohio, to come up with ways to recruit more African Americans to become teachers, to become mentors, to be in our school system. Very, very important.
I’m challenging the Department of Jobs and Family Services to do more with foster care. Look, our foster kids are, particularly our African American ones, spend much too long a time in foster care. They languish in foster care longer than their white brothers and sisters do. And that is not good. If you look at the numbers, it is very sad. While 16% of Ohio’s child population is African American, the population of Ohio’s foster care system is 31% African American. Among children who stay in foster care more than two years, one third of them are African-Americans. Again, even though African Americans children representative 16% of the child population of Ohio. They’re not adopted enough, they languish in foster care, and I’m challenging our team to do more about this. We’ve done some things, we have to do more. We are making a commitment to get kids out of foster care and into homes, black or white, by finding out what the problems are in the system and trying to fix that.
Our Department of Jobs and Family Services is reaching out to minorities who have experienced the children’s system themselves, the child service system themselves, to better understand their experiences and to work in partnership, to develop systemic solutions to this racial disparities. We hope to have a final report on that to share with you by the end of the year. This work will enhance the efforts currently underway by our Children’s Services Transformation Advisory Council, which traveled the state last year hearing from children and families impacted by the foster care system. Collectively their recommendations will help to reform Ohio’s foster care system to ensure better futures for all our children in Ohio.
Going to turn it over for a moment to John Houston. John is in Columbus. John’s going to talk about an issue that he and I have talked a lot about and our cabinet is focused on, and that has to do with African Americans who are in business, giving them a better opportunity to grow their business and attracting more African Americans to go into business. John.
Good. Thanks, John, very much. Very, very important. In regard to more equality in policing, we’ve already talked. We took a whole program, press conference, and talked about that. We have laid out to the general assembly, a comprehensive plan that will work, that will make things better, bring about more justice. And I’m asking them today to pass it. It’s there. It’s good. We’ve worked with some of the members of the general assembly on this. It needs to pass.
I’m also challenging our Department of Health and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to do more to address the lead paint problem in Ohio. Talked a lot about this in the past. I won’t spend time today, but it’s wrong. It’s wrong. We have to change this. It’s crazy that in the year 2020, we still have children who are being poisoned by lead paint.
Infant mortality, huge disparity in infant mortality, between African American babies and white babies. Huge disparity in the mortality of the mother. And that both of those simply have to change. We’re doing work, but we need to do more, and that is our commitment.
One of our commitments today also is the creation of the Governor’s Equity Advisory Board. The idea behind this is to have a permanent group working with us. People brought in from the outside, people not necessarily in government, not in government, but people who bring a wide array of experiences who can advise our cabinet members and who can advise me in things that we need to do to make this a more just society. This is a permanent, ongoing group to help guide us as we address the underlying conditions and root causes contributing to disparities in life and health and Ohio.
With me today is Alisha Nelson. Alisha is the Director of Recovery, Ohio. She was in the attorney general’s office with me, where she headed up what we called our heroin unit. So her work has been … a great deal of work has been in regard to recovery, great deal of work in regard to fighting the opioid epidemic. She has been working directly with the Minority Health Strike Force, and she’s here today to talk about our new Equity Advisory Board. So Alisha, thank you. Thank you very much for being with us.
Director, thank you very much. We appreciate your good work. I know you’ve worked very, very hard on this. Let me also introduce someone who has also worked very hard on this, a member of my cabinet. Ursel, there you are Ursel. You’re there. Ursel McElroy. She’s our Director of Aging. She’s got a-
She’s our Director of Aging. She’s got, as Alicia does, she has a big job. She’s also with me in the Attorney General’s office. She headed up our Elder Justice Initiative then. She’d been working directly with Minority Strikeforce. She’s with us today to really represent our Cabinet, and to talk about some of the specific commitments that our directors have made. So Urcel.
Good to have you here, and I’ll let you take off and talk a little bit about what you and the members of the Cabinet are doing.
Director McElroy, thank you very, very much. I appreciate you, and I appreciate Director Nelson, I appreciate what you both have done. I know you’ve worked very hard on this, but as we’ve talked about, our work is just beginning. We have more work to do. The goals that you all put together, I know you both were directly involved in writing this, is a beginning, but no one should think that it’s the end on deal. We have more things to do. The group that you’re putting together to work directly with you, I think, will give you some good, continue to give you good feedback and good guidance, and we’ll keep focusing. So thank you. Thank you both very, very, very much.
There are racial disparities in this country. The racial disparities in Ohio we’ve we talked about them, certainly in health, education, housing, and we could go on and on. There are many causes for this. Certainly racism is one of the causes. Sometimes it’s systemic racism, sometimes it’s very overt, sometimes it’s more subtle, but sadly in 2020, racism does still exist in this country. We have an obligation to look at these racial disparities and say, “That’s not right.” We have to do everything within our power to deal with this. And it’s incumbent upon all of us to do that. And we’ve talked today about some of the ways that we’re trying to do that, but there’ll be more things, and this really is a work in progress.
There are racial disparities in so many different areas in health and education. Racism is a public health crisis, and this is something that we have to work on every day. It really goes back to what I said when I was sworn in as Governor, and that simply is, “Our dream should be that every child in Ohio, wherever they live, whatever their background, whatever their race, they should have the chance to live the American dream.” And we need to do everything we can to help them have that chance. That’s really what our job is. Our job is to help create that opportunity, put them on a level playing field, making sure they get the education that they need. Making sure the barriers that are out there, that are a caused by racism or other barriers are knocked down so that every child has that opportunity. Let me open it up for questions.
Hello. Hi Laura. I guess we’re switching over. There you go. You’re on.
Well, first of all, I think Secretary LaRose is doing a good job. I don’t have a comment about that particular decision. The former Secretary of State, my Lieutenant Governor may in a moment, but as far as getting ballots in, we have four weeks in Ohio where you can get an absentee ballot and you you have to give no reason, you just want an absentee ballot. We’ve done this for a long time. We know how to do it. I would expect more and more Ohioans this year would be getting their ballots and sending them in absentee. So I think the system will work. People have the opportunity, if they don’t want to do that, they can get 13 hours on election day, so the old fashioned way, and they can show up. They also have opportunities other days to go directly to the board of elections and vote directly there.
So there’s many options for every Ohioan. And so I don’t believe that we’re going to have a problem. I don’t feel we’re going to have a problem in Ohio at all. We know how to do this. And I think again, because of the Coronavirus, people are going to be more incentivized maybe to do this earlier. And as Frank LaRose said do it early, get your application in, and you’ll get that early on. You can mail it and you’ll be done with it. And it’ll be good. So John, do you have anything? I don’t know if you’re still online here.
Ben, next question.
Well, let’s take the Warren County case, that case was under appeal. Look, this is very different than high school athletes playing. What this is, is bringing a lot of people in, many from out of State, who will stay a weekend, who will play a number of games with different teams. So you’ll have the intermixing of numerous games going on, and one athlete may be competing in a number of different games for that weekend. That is just not a good idea. I don’t know anybody that thinks that’s a very good idea from a public health point of view and the spread of the Coronavirus.
Now, we’re going to have an announcement on Tuesday, Lieutenant Governor and I are going to make about high school sports. We’ve been working with the Ohio Athletic Association, High School Athletic Association to get it right, to provide guidelines, to make it is safe as possible. I have great deal of confidence in the coaches who are out there. In fact, we’re going to set up a call and talk with some of the coaches in the next few days. I hope to talk to all the coaches because they really have the opportunity, not just in practice and not just in the game, to impress upon their athletes, young men and women, the importance of keeping a distance and being safe.
But it’s also important what young people do when they’re not playing, when they’re home, when they’re out and about. And so I think that having the coaches focus on that, we always look to our coaches for leadership, and this is in an era of the pandemic leadership, and fighting the Coronavirus is probably their most important job this year. So we’ll have an announcement on Tuesday, a little preview. This is a decision that’s going to be made by parents, it’s going to be decision that’s going to be made by schools. They’re going to make those decisions.
We’re going to restrict the number of fans. We want the athletes to compete, we want the young people to have their season, but we want to do it as safely as possible. And so this will be a little disruptive for some people, but what we want to make sure is that the parents, people who mean a lot to that particular child, have the opportunity to see them. And then for the rest of us we’ll have to hear about the game or maybe we can pick it up on the internet, YouTube. But it’s about the kids, and so we’ll have all the details. We’re working out the details this weekend for every one of their sports. So that will be coming. We look forward to Tuesday, and we’ll have it done this weekend, to get it done this weekend, we hope, and then we’ll be able to announce everything and more details on Tuesday.
Hi Kevin.
I am not aware that that was done. It could have been done. I’m just not aware of that, but that is something that we should in fact look at. So this is something that Urcel and Alicia and the two directors, I know, will take with the new group that’s starting up, and that can be the first thing to look at. I think it’s a good idea.
We’re going to continue to monitor the numbers. As I look at these numbers every day, there’s good news and there’s bad news. The bad news is that we’ve got very, very significant spread in some of our rural counties, not in some, other ones not so much. Our urban areas are trending down. But as Mayor Gunther and I were talking this morning, they’re still high, they’re above a hundred in most of our cities, and it’s just at a dangerously high level. All that means is the indicators aren’t going up, but they’re already at a high level. So look, as we go forward with students at State Columbus, with students coming back, 45,000 students coming back. That’s just that Ohio State, and then the other colleges and universities in the area, plus K-12.
So there’s certainly more opportunity for spread. So the beginning of school creates that opportunity. That’s why I’ve been pretty stringent, strict, in regard to the mass wearing in school, both the teachers, as well as the students. Social distancing, all of these things. And we’re working… I know the schools are working directly with their local health departments to stay very, very close, so that once there is an outbreak in one of the schools, that action can be taken. I’m not ready to make any decision about anything else that we would do. We’re going to continue to watch things.
And again, a lot of it comes back to simply what we do. And there’s frankly, a limit to what we can regulate. I would remind everyone that there still is a 25 person limit. Now there’s some exceptions, yes. But if you want to stay safe, wear a mask, keep your distance, use good sanitation with your hands, stay outside as much as you can. And those are all things that really certainly make a difference, but stay away from large crowds. Even when those crowds are made up of members of your family or friends. It just it’s not safe. The virus has spread too much in the communities, and we don’t know who has it. That’s the nature of it.
Hey Scott.
Yeah. We’ll get more into that on Tuesday. But our goal is to have this decided by parents, number one, number two, by school officials, local health departments, all of that inner interplay. And so these are decisions that are going to be made. And again, you’ve given me an opportunity to.
…and again, you’ve given me an opportunity to say something again, Scott, and that is what goes on in the school, and what goes on with the athletes is directly related to what goes on in the community. If you want your son, if you want your daughter to play sports, if you want them to have any other extracurricular activities, whether it is band or whether it’s cheerleading, whether it is debate, whether it is speech, whatever goes along with school, all these experiences that are great experiences, the ability of that school to stay open and the ability of your children to play sports is directly dependent on what’s going on in the community.
And it just is. And so we all just need to be in this together. We want to our kids to be able to have that experience, but it won’t last. It won’t last unless we slow this coronavirus down, and it’s not just the red counties, red counties are the ones on high, high alert in regard to that. But it’s every county. What goes on in that community just really impacts, and we can control that. We control. We control by what we do,
The answer to the second one is yes, but obviously there’s some exceptions. If the child was outside and they’re socially distancing would not have to wear a mask. And the order, you’ll see the order, it’ll be out, it’ll be online the next several hours. And you will see, see that. And ultimately, look, this is going to come down to the teachers and the teachers are going to be the ones who are going to deal with the young child, just as they deal with the child for everything else. Look, as far as polling places I agree with what the secretary said. We have an order that people wear masks that applies everywhere when it fits within the order.
So, yeah, people need to wear masks, but we do not expect, and we would not want, or anybody who works at the polls to be put in a position where they have to tell somebody, “Oh, you can’t vote unless you have a mask on”, we’re not going to do that. That is a basic right. Maybe that person who walked in has a reason for not wearing a mask that’s a health reason, but we can’t put our poll workers in that position. This is a very, very important, right. We would hope that people who go in and vote would be respectful of the poll workers, particularly who were there for 13 hours and longer than that, they’re seeing people for 13 hours. But no, I think look, the secretary of state I think is right on point.
Yes, here’s what we can do. I presented to the legislature as part of our strong Ohio bill, a very significant part of that bill. It doesn’t get written about a lot, but it is something that I believe every chief of police at least of a major city in Ohio agrees with. And that is a violent offender, a repeat violent offender who has long ago, lost his, it’s usually his, right to have a gun when they are found with a gun in possession of a gun in absolute violation of the law. The judge should have the ability to put them away for a long time. If we can do that, if we can pass this and give this to our prosecutors and give this to our sheriffs and give this to our police departments, particularly in our cities where we’re seeing just horrible carnage, if we can get that passed, that will be a very, very significant tool.
It won’t solve every problem, but I’ll tell you, when you talk to chiefs of police in cities, what they tell you is we know basically who the repeat violent offenders are. If we get them off the street, just get them out. And it’s usually not a huge number of people someplace like Lima, Springfield, that size might be 20 people. Might be more than that in Columbus, but it’s a relatively small number of people, you get rid of them, and frankly, the violence goes down and then you don’t have five-year-old children who are killed because they were in the wrong place. Plus they had the right to be in their home, but somebody shot and aimed at somebody else and ended up killing the child. So, yeah, it’s a big problem. We’ve seen this violence escalate and we need to solve it. And I’ve sent to the General Assembly a very, very well thought out provision and I didn’t write it all up. We had prosecutors look at it. We had police look at it, it needs to pass. So yes, there is things that we can do.
Well, I thought we were releasing them and if we’re not, let me, let me check in and see if there’s any legal reason we can’t do that. I know we went through this discussion a couple months ago. I thought we we’re getting information out. Let me, let me see, and I’ll report back on Tuesday.
Marty, I spent 20 years in the United States Congress. I had my chance to be there and to vote and to have an opinion. Let me just talk as a representative of the state and a representative of my friends who run cities and villages and townships and counties. This Coronavirus is been devastating to many, many, many people. City’s going to run low on money for fire. These are big concerns. There should be a concern about where we’re going to be in the state in regard of education. Look, we made some cuts. We didn’t like making them I’ll guarantee you, but we made them because we had no assurance that we would be able to, if we didn’t make the cuts to be able to sustain the level that we were spending, we knew we couldn’t.
So these are important things. Having flexibility is important. As I look towards the future in regard to what we’re going to have to do in Ohio, as I’ve said, we need to double and then we need to double again, our testing. We’ve come up 22,000, I think, something like that today. But look, we need to double that and then we need to double it again. That’s not going to be cheap. I mean, we’re trying to do it as cheaply as we can. We’re trying to build our own infrastructure, but that’s going to cost money. So look, all those things are important. There’s a bill to be had out there. I’m confident that there can be a bill. I think what the president did, it was the right thing. The president tried to move the debate, and he came out with a proposal and said, “Hey, you guys, aren’t going to move? I’ll move.”
But we all know that executive orders, particularly in this area of spending are blunt instruments. And it’s much better if Congress can do what only Congress can do and that’s pass a bill and get it done. So I hope that there’ll be able to do that. We have basic public services that are at stake. What else is at stake is our ability to test. And these are essential. I mean, it goes back to… We have to stay on top of the coronavirus, we have to try to keep it down. If it wears up too much, you’re going to see what’s happened in some of the Southern states where the economy starts going back and pull back because people are afraid. So it all is important and we need the help, and we need a bill.
Yeah. Let me just first say that a nursing home can, in all fairness, they can have an outbreak and still be doing everything right without commenting about any particular case. I have charged our department to, again, review sanitation to go back and look at this in the nursing homes, we are now started on a new program of testing. If you remember had the National Guard testing in our nursing homes, we now have a new protocol. We’re requiring every nursing home, basically to do their own testing. That testing has to occur every two weeks, frankly, I would like to get down to every seven days, we’re going to start at two weeks and then get the capacity up. We’re going to do that. What’s happening is we’ve arranged the nursing homes basically to do their own swabbing.
The Ohio National Guard, now, instead of doing testing, the Ohio National Guard is doing the logistics, which simply means taking those swabs from the samples, from the nursing home directly to the lab. And it’s a very complicated, complex, because we have nursing homes all over. We have labs all over and trying to match them up, and the guard is doing that. And let me just say to the guard, you’re doing a great job. And we have kicked into that phase of it. So more testing in our nursing home, more testing, more tracing in our nursing homes. More emphasis on sanitation.
Well, masks are effective. And we’ve seen a decline in the parts of the state where they’ve been used the most. And that is our urban areas. We put those mask orders in earlier. We went to the red counties. Most of them at that time were urban areas. And so now we’re continuing to see a decline. In fact we’ve seen a decline where some of these counties are going off red. We saw the improvement that was made in Hamilton County, for example. We’ve seen Franklin County come down, we’ve seen Cuyahoga County come down. So these counties or these urban counties are coming down. That’s where the mask worrying is most prevalent. We’ve seen where the mask wearing is not as prevalent. We’ve seen these numbers go up. Now, it’s not as simple as that. There’s a lot more issues, I’m sure, involved, but that certainly is one.
So, yeah, as doctor said yesterday, she listed the most important things in order. And you noticed the first thing she said was masks. Second thing was distance, and on from there. So yeah. Look, we’re seeing where these incidents are occurring. We’re seeing where people are getting the COVID and many times it’s where people are letting their guard down. They’re not wearing a mask. They’re not distancing. They’re among friends, they’re among family and they kind of let their guard down. So yeah, masks work. We know they work. And when you marry that mask with distance, when you put those two things together, it’s a tough a one, two punch combination to beat.
Yeah, look, I was asked that question by some superintendents who asked me will you guarantee that you won’t ever go in and step in? I said, “Look, no, I can’t do that. That would be irresponsible.” But what we want to do is allow the local community to have their say on this, see how it works, what we’ve tried to do, and I’ve done today and I’m going to do tomorrow and do every day. I’m talking to the superintendents, but I’m also talking to people out in the communities is if you’re a red county you got to get those numbers down. The spread that occurs in your county is going to occur in your school. And so that decision, that threshold decision about whether or not they go remote, they go hybrid, they go in person. We’re still leaving that with the local school, but we’re going to monitor it or see what’s happening. And look, we can see some things in Indiana. Indiana is a little bit ahead of us. A few weeks ahead of us in opening schools, at least in some of their districts, we’ve got to watch what’s going on in Indiana. We got to watch what’s going on in other states. And then when our schools start to open, we got to watch them very carefully. So, look, I mean, the local communities have historically governed this in Ohio. We’re going to let them start. We’re going to see how this works, but we were saying to the people in the community, you’ve got to understand your school is not an island. It’s not separate.
It is a part of the community, and it will reflect what you’re doing in the community. And if you’re not wearing a mask in your community, if you’re not slowing the virus down, it will not slow down in your school. And look, we got teachers, young people, maybe don’t show the COVID don’t have the symptoms many times, but the 50 year old teacher may. The custodian may. Person in the kitchen may. So look, we have a lot at stake. The schools have a lot at stake. And I know everybody in the school knows that. I mean, every superintendent I’ve talked to has talked about their personnel, and they’re concerned about the personnel and they’re going to do everything they can to protect them.
I would think that that’s a decision to be being made by the school. I’m not aware that we’ve changed any kind of guidance for that. I’ll check, but I don’t think anybody in the health department’s changed guidance. I mean, look what evolves the science evolves. And I haven’t read every single study that’s been done in regard to there are some masks that clearly provide more protection than others, but the experts will tell you, look, instead of getting hung up on which kind of mask, and then people not wear any mask, let people wear a masks and they can be homemade, they can be all kinds of things, but it’s getting that blockage. What we’re seeing in some medical facilities is we’re seeing a mask and shields that medical personnel are wearing a mask, then they’re wearing a shield on top of that. So, again we, we let the local communities work that out. We don’t micromanage it down to that level, but everyone that wearing a mask will make a difference. Everyone trying to keep the social distance will make a big difference.
Those resolutions, and sometimes as I look at the resolution of resolutions, I think I only looked at one. You don’t have a lot of different things in them. What I said today is what I’ve said in the past. We have disparities in our communities. They’re not acceptable. We have to work on that. I believe that history will judge me and I will judge myself by what we do. And so I made my statement today, very, very, very clear about what I think about this. And there are these disparities in health. There are the disparities in education. There are disparities in housing and many, many other things, and we have to change that. But what I think I’ll get judged by is what I do, what I do. And so it’s up to the general assembly, listen, these are not in resolutions that the governor signs, the resolutions.
But what we’re only judged by is what we do. And do we do something about racism? I do speak out against racism and whether this resolution is the best way to do it or not, I’m going to leave that up to the general assembly. But I made it very, very clear what I think about this and there are disparities out there that are caused by racism. There are other disparities that are caused by other things we have to fix them all. Sometimes the racism is overt. A person is racist. Sometimes someone is doing something and they don’t even realize it, which is why, again, education and training. And some of these things are so very, very important when we’re talking about our own employees.
So I’m going to leave that up to the general assembly. I’m the governor. I made my statement about what I think is important and I think we need to be judged and the legislature needs to be judged. What do we do in this area? At the end of the year, what have we done? And there’s some very, very tangible things that I know I can do in the executive branch and we will do, and we’ll continue to do more. And there’s things that the general assembly can do as well. We look forward to seeing you all on Tuesday. We will talk in more detail about sports, and talk about other things, and I hope everybody has a good weekend. Thank you very much.

Jim McMahon,United Kingdom,2020-09-07,"When there are so many unanswered questions around the Government’s quarantine measures it is astounding that this statement failed address them. Passengers and the aviation industry need confidence that Ministers aren’t simply making it up as they go along.
This seemed to be an exercise in deflecting attention. We are still yet to see the scientific evidence for the Government’s decision making and why, unlike in Scotland and Wales, those returning from Portugal don’t need to self-isolate.
After the mess we’ve seen it is vital that the Government undertakes a review into quarantine policy, to report as soon as possible. It should include outlining options for a robust testing regime in airports, and related follow up tests, that could help to safely minimise the need for 14-day quarantine.

Nigel Adams,United Kingdom,2020-01-10,"This relates to concerns the Secretary of State has that there may be public interest considerations—as set out in section 58 of Enterprise Act 2002—that are relevant to the recent acquisition of the i newspaper by DMGT and that these concerns warrant further investigation.
A “minded to” letter has therefore been issued to the parties on one public interest ground specified in section 58 of the Enterprise Act 2002:
It is important to note that the Secretary of State has not taken a final decision on intervention at this stage. In line with the statutory guidance on media mergers, the “minded to” letter invites further representations in writing from the parties and gives them until 13 January to respond. The Secretary of State plans to make her final decision, which needs to be made on a quasi-judicial basis, on whether to issue an intervention notice no later than week commencing 20 January.
Following these reports, the Secretary of State would need to decide whether to refer the matter for a more detailed investigation by the CMA under section 45 of the Enterprise Act 2002.

Sajid Javid,United Kingdom,2018-09-25,"Good afternoon.
Estoy encantado de estar hoy aqui en Madrid.
I’ve been lucky enough to hold various posts within the British government.
But one similarity between them all is that I spend a lot of time trying to convince people to have a warm, open and productive relationship with Britain.
But I’m pleased to say that with Spain, the UK already has a strong and valuable relationship.
We have a proud history of working together…
And I’m not just talking about Gareth Bale helping Real Madrid win the Champions League and David Silva helping Manchester City win the Premier League!
There are strong ties between our nations.
More than 180,000 Spaniards live in the UK, and 2 million visit every year.
19 million Brits holiday in Spain each year and around 300,000 have made their homes here.
We have 5,000 Spanish people working in our National Health Service…
…and another 5,000 working in scientific research, including trying to find cures for illnesses like Alzheimer’s and cancer.
There are also 12,000 Spaniards studying in UK universities and 55,000 students are in British schools in Spain.
That means that British schools have more of a footprint here in Spain than anywhere else in Europe.
We are also allies in business.
Spain is now the UK’s seventh largest trading partner and our total bilateral trade was up 5% last year.
The UK is Spain’s top destination for foreign direct investment.
But perhaps it is our security relationship that is the real jewel in the crown.
Whether it be against Daesh, drugs runners, or human traffickers, we could not ask for more from Spanish law enforcement and intelligence agencies in terms of commitment and collaboration.
Our 2 countries regularly work together to protect our people.
We share tools to crack terror cells.
We stop murderers and rapists slipping over our borders.
We end exploitation by organised crime gangs.
And we bring these monsters to justice.
It’s a sad fact that our countries share many of the same security threats and challenges.
We have a shared history of fighting terrorism – be that in the form of the IRA or ETA.
Our countries have both also been victims of terrorist attacks in recent years.
Last year, the UK was rocked by terror attacks in Manchester and in London.
In Spain, innocent people were mown down on Las Ramblas.
Our countries shared the pain of these attacks.
During the London Bridge attack, it was a Spanish national – Ignacio Echeverría – who sadly lost his life when he confronted terrorists with only his skateboard to try to save others.
He was posthumously awarded Britain’s highest honour – the George Medal last year…
…and I’m pleased to say that his father will collect his posthumous George Medal in Buckingham Palace next month.
In Barcelona, one of the victims was a 7 year old boy with dual British-Australian nationality.
I will pay tribute to all victims of this mindless terrorism later today in the Bosque del Recuerdo.
Both our countries face an enduring threat from Islamist terrorism, which we work together to combat on a daily basis, wherever it manifests itself – be that on our streets or online.
There are other threats which our countries face together too.
For instance, the threat from large scale cybercrime is growing as digital technologies advance.
Cybercrime does not respect borders and this was shown with devastating effect when the WannaCry ransomware attack impacted more than 100 countries around the globe.
We also both face the threat of hostile state activity.
We both have a watchful eye on Russia following on from the despicable nerve agent attack in Salisbury, which left 4 people fighting for their lives and one innocent woman dead.
Following this attack, many European countries stood with the UK to take decisive action, with Spain expelling 2 Russian diplomats in response. We are grateful to Spain for standing with us.
When it comes to our security, we know that when we collaborate we are at our strongest.
We know that sharing tools, sharing data and expertise keeps people safe in Spain, in Britain – and across Europe too.
And that’s exactly what we’re doing.
We’re working together through the EU, through NATO and bilaterally in all sorts of different ways.
For example, in March this year, 39 women were freed from sexual exploitation at the hands of an organised criminal gang here in Spain…
…as a result of a joint operation between the UK’s National Crime Agency and Spanish and Nigerian law enforcement.
In April, the National Crime Agency again worked with Spanish law enforcement to seize nearly 9 tonnes of cocaine in Algeciras … the largest ever haul from a single container in Europe.
And, of course, nowhere is Anglo-Spanish co-operation stronger or more visible than in the joint operation called the Captura campaign … which has seen 81 dangerous British fugitives successfully tracked down and arrested.
Without cooperation between our agencies, these dangerous fugitives, these 81, could still be at large…
…these people traffickers could still be lurking in our communities…
…and these drugs still flooding our streets.
This co-operation is often underpinned by EU law enforcement and criminal justice measures, which we both make use of to our mutual benefit.
In particular, I welcome the strong co-operation and leadership that the UK and Spain have shown within Europol to drive forward the EU’s efforts to tackle illicit firearms trafficking.
We make extensive mutual use of European Arrest Warrants to arrest criminals, helping to fight trafficking and so much else.
For example, in the last 5 years, the UK arrested over 200 people on behalf of Spain, and the Spanish authorities have arrested over 180 on our behalf.
We are also both a part of the Schengen Information System, which enables the sharing of real-time automated alerts on missing and wanted people with law enforcement agencies across Europe.
We’re working together to tackle child sexual abuse.
Just last year, our Spanish partners assisted in the arrest of one of the UK’s most wanted sex offenders.
This twisted paedophile had been hiding in Spain for nearly 2 years and if he hadn’t been caught, he may well be preying today on more children.
The European Arrest Warrant enabled Spanish authorities to locate him and return him to face justice in the UK where he is now behind bars.
These are just some examples of the collaborative security work that is going on every single day.
In all areas – from counter-terrorism to serious and organised crime, we are working together to keep our citizens safe.
That’s in both our interests.
The nature of the current threat from serious organised crime, cybercrime, terrorism and hostile state activity is truly global.
And it constantly changes, as geopolitics and technology evolve.
To keep pace with this and to ensure we are able to respond effectively, we must continue to work together.
Criminals who seek to harm our citizens, exploit vulnerable people, damage our economies, and challenge our values, are finding new ways to do so – regardless of borders or geography.
We must continue to find new ways to fight back.
That means having seamless operational co-operation, real-time sharing of data, and state of the art technology.
It means ensuring those who would cause us harm know that they cannot escape justice by crossing from the UK into Spain or vice versa.
It means sharing our expertise, experience and intelligence, so we can stay one step ahead.
The UK Prime Minister said earlier this year that the UK is unconditionally committed to European security.
And I want to reiterate that message today – that deal or no deal – we remain committed to ensuring the security of Europe.
I’m pleased that Minister Grande-Marlaska has taken the time today to discuss with me the future of our security co-operation.
Because the benefits of our security cooperation – and its importance – are clear.
And this co-operation is facilitated and enhanced by access to EU tools and measures to the benefit of citizens in both our countries and across Europe.
We want an ambitious security relationship going forward after Brexit, which we have clearly set out.
We accept that outside the EU, our relationship must of course be quite different. But it does not have to be weaker.
We accept that things will need to change.
We will not be carrying on as if we were a member state.
We will be leaving all the various EU institutions.
We will no longer be involved in EU decision-making.
But the point is, we can make these changes and others without undermining the day-to-day operational co-operation which plays such an important role in keeping European citizens safe.
We want our security relationship with Spain – indeed with all our European partners – to be as strong and effective as ever once we have left the European Union.
That’s why the UK government has proposed a comprehensive treaty between the EU and the UK which will allow security co-operation to continue and lives to be saved.
And I will keep putting forward the case for this continued co-operation.
The kind of model we are proposing is one the EU is familiar with.
It’s relatively simple.
But we need the political will to make this happen.
The alternative – abandoning EU co-operation tools – would lead to a damaging reduction in our ability to work together, despite our best efforts.
While we have had some initial conversations with the Commission, we now need to go further and faster to help make sure that all our citizens stay safe and that crooks can’t prosper.
I’ve spoken a lot today about the importance of working together.
Working together in all sorts of different areas.
Indeed, it’s something our 2 countries have been very good at for a great many years.
In fact, UK and Spanish diplomatic ties go back 500 years.
Commercial ties go back even further.
As I’ve said, the security links between the UK and Spain have been going from strength to strength.
But we are now facing an intensive period of negotiations which will define the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
That will of course have implications for our security co-operation in the future.
I very much hope that the negotiations will reach a conclusion which ensures we are able to continue to co-operate effectively with our European partners to keep our people safe.
We have made the UK’s commitment to Europe’s security very clear.
Setting out what we think is the best way to guarantee it.
Today I want to promise you this.
That I will continue to do all I can to make sure that the relationship between our two great nations remains strong…
…that our citizens are kept safe…
…and that we continue to face our common threats and challenges together, long into the future.
",2018 Speech on Security Relationship with the EU,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/sajid-javid-2018-speech-on-security-relationship-with-the-eu/
Nancy Pelosi,United States of America,2020-05-21,"… to pass the 19th amendment. As you know, that is the amendment that gives women the right to vote. Not that they were given, because they fought very hard for it, but that success was achieved. It took another year for it to be passed, the rest of the process, the ratification and the rest.
In August we’ll be observing the 100th anniversary of women having the right to vote, but today we are honoring women, what happened in the House of Representatives on this very day. And we’re very proud of the fact that we have over a hundred women in Congress now, over 90 women on the democratic side. We made a decision about that a long time ago.
Among them are… Carolyn Maloney who couldn’t be with us, but she has been a champion on all of these issues, whether it’s the Women’s Museum or the ERA, Equal Rights Amendment, you name it, the effect of public policy on women in every way. And I want to salute her as well as the three chairs of our Democratic women’s caucus: Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence of Michigan, Congresswoman Jackie Speier of California, and an ongoing chair Congresswoman Lois Frankel of Florida. But we have many in this picture, many chairs of committees, of both chairs of both committees, and we’re very proud of the contribution to women in the Congress of the United States dating back to 101 years ago when this House took the initiative to go forward.
I’m very honored to be joined here today by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, representative from the District of Columbia, Congressman John Sarbanes of Maryland. We’re all spaced appropriately… Of Maryland, and Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands. Welcome to all of you.
Okay. We’re in challenging times. And again, we have a privilege of celebrating the right to vote. As speaker, again, I’m proud to serve with over a hundred women in the House. Sadly, as we observe this milestone, voting is under assault. It is both from a systemic nationwide campaign of voter suppression and from the coronavirus. The fear of getting sick threatens some not to go to the poll. People should not have to choose between voting and preserving their good health and that of their families. Because no matter what you do, when you go out, you bring it home. Again, no one should be forced to be forced to vote for their health for their vote.
In the CARES Act, we put a down payment of $400 million for states to protect the ballot. In the HEROES Act, we add to that the balance of what we think we need to have voting at home and to protect the ballot. That would be $3.6 billion, a small price to pay for our democracy and the good health of Americans going to the polls. It would be there to expand vote at home, vote by mail some call it, at home, including no-excuse absentee ballot, same-day registration. And again, having polling places available for those who want to participate in person for whatever reason, whether it’s questions about the ballot or their ballot and the rest. That they have appropriate timing, placing and the rest for that. And again, online registration and same-day voter registration, which I mentioned, this is all very, very important.
We call on Leader McConnell… We have the HEROES bill. Others say he has the zeroes bill. We need this bill for many reasons. We need it for to honor our heroes, protect those who are risking their lives every day to save lives, and at the same time, may lose their jobs. With our state and local, tribal and territorial support in the legislation, open our economy with the testing, tracing, treatment and isolation that is in there and putting money in the pockets of the American people as we get through this terrible economic challenge. As you see the numbers this morning, matters are even worse.
Central to so much of it, as we say, this is about the life, the livelihood and the life of our democracy. Central to the life of our democracy is removing obstacles of participation to voting. And now even more so, when voting can be a risk to your health as we saw it demonstrated in Wisconsin.
Here we are with, again, saluting our women members of Congress. Imagine the courage of the suffragists, the courage that they had to make this happen. It took a long time, and how proud we are to stand on their shoulders now to make public policy for our great country and we don’t want anything to stand in the way of the right to vote.
I have a privilege now of introducing a very special guest, a leader in our House Democratic Caucus, a leader of women in the country, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton is serving her 15th term in the House of Representatives, representing the District of Columbia. Before her congressional service, President Jimmy Carter appointed her as the first woman to have the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC. Very prestigious, very important. Eleanor Holmes Norton came to Congress a national figure, a champion of civil rights and feminist movement. She is a tenured professor at Georgetown University School of Law… Where my son went in undergrad, Representative Plaskett… the board member of three Fortune 500 companies-
I’m just saying you came to Congress as that.
Just to say that’s why she was named one of the 100 most powerful women, and then of course, one of the most powerful women in Washington. The congressional work of congressional voting representation has been so much for the District of Columbia, been so much a part of what her leadership has been about and so many other things as well. She has led us with her lifelong struggle for equal and civil rights and universal human rights.
It’s an honor on this day, when we recognize the 100th anniversary of the House voting for women to have the right to vote for me to recognize someone they’d all be very, very proud of, representative from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes, Norton.
Thank you very much, Eleanor. And as we have discussed between us and among us when we’re together, we’re so proud that women have taken seriously the sacred right of voting and so many women are turning out for elections to vote, so many women to run, so many women to win. And with that, speaking of the right to vote, I have the privilege of presenting a champion in the Congress of the United States, who has been the author and the inspiration, the intellectual leader in HR1, a legislation that we ran on in 2018.
As we said, our platform was only three things in 2018, and it continues to be our focal points. One to lower the cost of healthcare by lowering the cost of prescription drugs and keeping the preexisting condition benefit as a benefit. Two, that’s lower health costs to bigger paychecks by building the infrastructure of America in a green way. God bless you. Three, to keep a cleaner government. HR-1, and in HR-1 one are so many elements so that are about promoting the vote and ending voter suppression.
But I want you to hear from the author himself, he has been a relentless, persistent, dissatisfied advocate and leader on this subject. And he commands the respect of not only the members of Congress on this subject, but so many others out there who care in a bipartisan way and in a nonpartisan way on how sacred it is to protect the right to vote. Congressman John Sarbanes of Maryland.
Let’s see how we do this now. Okay, I’ll go this way. I’ll go here.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Congressman Sarbanes, for your tremendous leadership. Long before coronavirus, you were advocating for H.R. 1, which we did pass, as you said, March of last year. How even more important it is now. One of the committees of jurisdiction for the HEROES Act is the Oversight Committee, Oversight and Reform Committee. I mentioned Carolyn Maloney earlier, who chairs that committee. It was formerly chaired by our darling Elijah, who’s dancing with the angels now, and we want to be worthy of the legacy that he left us. But all three of these members are members of the Oversight Committee, and so much of what is in the HEROES Act that relates to the subject we’re talking about here is from that committee, not only in terms of voting, but in terms of the Postal System.
The Postal System is under threat also by the administration, from the administration, and we want to remove all doubt that we support the Postal System, which is essential to vote by mail. It’s also essential to the health of the American people, because over a billion packages of medicine were delivered to families last year, well before coronavirus. Much more than a billion, and 90% of the medicines that are needed for veterans, veterans receive by the mail. So the postal issue is a health issue. The voting issue is a health issue. They are connected, and a person who serves on that committee is with us, another generation of service in the Congress, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett.
She serves with Congresswoman Holmes Norton on the Transportation Committee, so essential to CARES 1. She serves with the Congresswoman and our distinguished Peter Defazio on that committee, on the Gov Reform Committee. It used to be called that. Now it’s called Oversight. When I served on it, it was called Gov Ops. Now it’s Oversight and Reform. And then she also serves on the Agriculture Committee. Very, very essential in the fight all the time, but the fact that there’s hunger in America, the Ag Committee was very instrumental in putting the funds in for SNAP, for not only food stamps, but all kinds of other emergency food initiatives, as well as just removing all doubt that as bad as it has been in terms of hunger in America, food insecurity is not going to take us down during this coronavirus cycle.
So I’m pleased to yield to another generation of members. Congresswoman Plaskett, will you share a few words with us? And thank you for being here.
Thank you, Congresswoman Plaskett, for your service, your leadership, and your words today. When we talk about the Postal Service, though, I just want to add one thing, and that is that the Postal Service Board of Governors, bipartisan, all appointed by President Trump, have recommended what we have in the bill, in the HEROES Act for the Postal Service. The appropriation, taking off restrictions on how they use loans. Actually, they propose more. We’re going to save some for the infrastructure bill that comes next, because it relates to that. So again, these are connected. This week, I’ve had three focuses so far. That was, we started with the Postal Service the other day, yesterday we focused on food insecurity in America, today we’re focusing on the vote.
Let me just indulge for a moment, my own personal history for a moment. My father was elected to Congress as a New Deal Democrat many decades ago. When he was in the Congress, he was Chair of the District of Columbia Subcommittee of Appropriation. As such, he was deemed the unofficial Mayor of Washington. They had no mayor, but everything that happened happened through the Appropriations Community for the funding. So I come from a tradition in the DNA of home rule, home rule, home rule, and then of course it would blossom even further later. So it’s a thrill for me to be here with Eleanor and all of my colleagues, and having John Sarbanes mention the joined Congressman, mentioning the statehood for the District of Columbia. So thank you for your leadership there.
When my father left the Congress, oh, when he was there, speaking of women, he had on his subcommittee, invited the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, to testify about the conditions in the welfare institutions in Washington, and particularly St. Elizabeth’s. So in my office, you will see a picture of him introducing, welcoming Eleanor Roosevelt, a woman leader, and the first First Lady ever to testify before Congress. So we have that connection before we were ever born, I guess, but nonetheless, that’s what I had.
Then when my father left Congress a generation later, he became Mayor of Baltimore. But when he left to become mayor, a generation later, Paul Sarbanes took his place in the Congress of the United States, later to become Senator Sarbanes. And when he did, Barbara Mikulski took his place, another great woman leader in our country, and after that, Ben Cardin, both going on to the Senate. After that, John Sarbanes. So John Sarbanes represents the district that my father represented, and it’s an emotional tie, as you can see.
So again, we talk about history, but what we love is the fresh recruit, the fresh, invigorating-
What about history, but what we love is the fresh recruit, the fresh invigoration of the Congress that John is and that Stacey is, and how they are inspiring a whole other generation of leaders to protect the vote, to protect the lives and the livelihood of the American people, and was acknowledged… Thank you, Stacy, Representative Plaskett, for acknowledging the House Admin Committee I wanted to acknowledge. So Lofgren, the chair of that committee, who did have those hearings led by Marcia Fudge around the country. And then we did pass Terri Sewell’s voting rights act. We hope the Senate will do so, as well. With that, pleased to answer any questions you may have about how we go forward. Garrett? Garrett?
Excuse me. If I just may, I’m happy to come back to that question. Does anyone have any questions about 101 years since the House or anything that we talked about, about voting rights and the danger that they’re in from the President, or hopefully they won’t be when he sees the response? Anything? Yes.
Yes.
When the President criticized Michigan for sending out applications, of course he misrepresented what was going on there, but what’s new. But at the same time, Republican Secretaries of State around the country were engaging in a vote by mail, vote at home, however you want to call it. So this is, again, for the people. It’s not to be afraid of the people. And that’s just another insecurity that exists there. The that’s why this money is needed. You’ve asked exactly the question. And I think every… Yesterday, it was all but one. I think now, maybe every one of the states have asked for the money that was in the first… have applied for the money that was in the first bill. And of course, the sooner we get it and the more we have, the clearer it will be. Because we’re giving people an option that we want to be able to deliver on. But if they don’t support the resources, then they have been stood in the way of voting, which is in keeping with their voter suppression, in general. Any other questions on voting or women having the right to vote? Garrett? Yes, sir.
Okay. We’ll go to Garrett.
I think he will. I think he will. I think that he wants to put some things on the table. But right now, right now he has decided to obstruct. To obstruct us to get the support we need to give to our healthcare workers who need PPE. He’s obstructing the will of the people to open our economy by having testing, tracing, treatment and isolation where necessary. He’s obstructing our ability to give states and localities, territories and tribal entities, the resources they need to stay open. These people are risking their lives to save lives. And now they may lose their jobs because of the money they have to spend to on the coronavirus, but also the opportunity lost, the revenue lost because of the virus.
So, we have broad support across the country, Democratic and Republican leaders of towns and the rest, in the way the bill is. Go to speaker.gov/heroesact and find out how your community, your state, your city, your town, your county, benefits from this legislation. And you’ll see why there’s such broad support. You may not know it yet, but they will come to the table. And they will do so because it is absolutely essential. Our bill is focused, disciplined, and what is necessary to defeat this virus, but also to honor our heroes so that they can keep the jobs that are helping save lives in our country, while we put money in the pockets of those who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own. Also to, again, support voting rights and doing voting at home, as well as supporting the postal service in order to do that. Also to feed the American people, that moms are saying children under 12 at the highest rate of food insecurity ever.
And it’s always been a problem in our country, now even exacerbated by the coronavirus. So it’s about feeding people, feeding… aren’t they ashamed to say, I don’t want… As they have in the past few bills, I don’t want to spend money to feed people in America? Our children who are losing their meals because they’re not going to school, and sometimes that’s the only place that they get a meal, our seniors who depend on Meals on Wheels and other entities for food. So I don’t know. You’d have to ask him why he doesn’t want to feed the American people, that he doesn’t want to put money in the pockets of American people, why he doesn’t want to honor our heroes in this fight against the virus, and why he does not want to defeat COVID-19, enemy of the American people. With that… Oh yes, sir.
That I don’t know, but it has been very well planned, thought out, and the rest. I salute Steny Hoyer, our distinguished leader, as well as Zoe Lofgren and Jim McGovern, the chair of the Rules Committee and the chair of House Administration for the work they did, negotiating with the Republicans, trying to find a common ground with them, taking some of their suggestions, but they just don’t support proxy voting. But that doesn’t mean we’re not going to be doing the work that the American people sent us here to do. And if some people should stay home because of a health issue, thank you for not sharing. We’d rather you do stay home. And if the transportation is a challenge in that regard, we want their voices to be heard. So the planning that has gone into it has been very smart. Yesterday, I sent out the letter in response to the declaration by the House, the Capitol physician, that says that we will start the clock ticking on this… It’s 45 day clock… Ticking on this when we come back next week. Yes, sir.
Excuse me, just one second. My colleagues, you’re welcome to stay for the other stuff here, but I know you’re all very, very busy. But I’m honored that you’re here, but I don’t know where we’re going with some of this, though. Sometimes I’ve been known to be a place where you may not want to be. Thank you, John Sarbanes. Thank you, Stacy Plaskett. Thank you, Eleanor Holmes Norton.
Well, we will be back full force, when we are able to, because of testing, tracing, and treatment. We are very concerned about the health and wellbeing, not only of the members of Congress, that’s the smallest number involved, but of the press, of the staff, of the custodians, of people… Thousands of people manage this Capitol, so that it is ready for visitors to come witness democracy in action. So I couldn’t possibly answer that question. No sooner than we are ready, but we are constantly preparing for that time. But science will be the answer. When science says to us, we’ve tested enough people to have enough of a measure of how challenging this is, and therefore able to treat, to trace and treat those who need to be treated, then we’ll be closer to that time. I certainly hope it will be soon. What was the second part?
Oh yes. Yes, of course. We’re the House of Representatives, the people’s House, and we have been working. There’s a great deal of communication, in terms of our duties as representatives, to be in contact with the people we represent, so that we can truly speak for them. But in addition to that, committees have varying degrees of hearings, whether they call them forums or round tables or whatever it is, communicating. And we hope that… We need, we have some timetables that we must honor for the Appropriations Bill. We have a timetable for the Defense Authorization Bill. We’re just so ready to go forward with infrastructure, to build America in a green way, as we go forward, and create good paying jobs as we again grow our economy in a very wise way. So again, we have a full agenda that people have been working on for a long time. So it’s a continuation of that, but also an intensification.
So with the proposal that has gone out, it’s not just about proxy voting, which we will be prepared for. It’s also about how committees can do their work virtually in-person or in a hybrid way. Because some of the witnesses were not maybe able to show up, even if the members are there. So it may have to be a hybrid. And that is what we have been working on. I’m very proud of the enthusiasm of everybody to come back. But again, I can just tell you what… In terms of my own travel on commercial airlines, it is a challenge. And so we had to-
It is a challenge, and so we have to recognize that. But I’m very proud of the courage of our members, and the courage to vote for the HEROES Act. They said to me, “You go big. You go big.” We went big, but not any bigger than is necessary. In fact, we could do more, and we probably will have to, depending on what comes next in our economy and in meeting our health needs. But again, this is about, again, honoring those who are risking their lives to save lives by supporting state and local, territorial and tribal, as well as testing.
Did you see the Columbia report that came out that if one week sooner, one week sooner, we had had a lockdown, as other countries had, Korea was too … Korea and the United States had the first fatality, had the first, I don’t know if it’s the first case or the first death, but the first death the same day. They locked down. They’ve lost over 300 people in Korea, around.
Just over 300 people. We waited a couple of weeks. The report further says if we had done it when Korea did, we’d have saved closer to well over 50,000 of those lives. But just one week was well into the 30,000s of people who would not have died.
So we just really have to be smart and strategic, and that is what our bill does. When we say testing, tracing, treatment, isolation, it’s smart. It’s strategic. It has a vision. It has a goal. It has a timetable. It has milestones. It has thresholds. A plan, a strategic plan to quantify what this is, be able to trace and treat, so that we can defeat this virus isn’t what we have done. But putting aside how we got here, this is about going forward and we want to do so in the most science based way to get the job done.
Did you have a question, dear?
Okay.
Well, I thank you for that question because everybody wants out. With all the love that we have for each other and the rest, we can’t even see each other. I said I can’t wait until I can hug my grandchildren again, but that will have to wait. TI would just say people have to be very careful. They should wear masks. These people don’t wear masks. The mask is not to protect you, the mask is to protect other people. So when you don’t wear the mask, what are you saying? “I don’t care about you, but I hope you’re wearing a mask and care about me.” The masks are very, very important. Spacing, very, very important. So there could be ways for people to engage. I do not recommend any large public events. I think that that’s dangerous still, but there could be a way to have discipline, distance, and masks, hand washing, all of those things. And they’re ways to, again, have a family meal over the Memorial weekend, keeping our distances and not double dipping into the guacamole. That would not be a good idea. By the way, it’s never a good idea.
No double dipping. But especially, maybe we’ll all pick up some very good habits from all of this. But we respect the enthusiasm that people have to get out and get some fresh air and the rest, but they should not do it rationalizing that it doesn’t matter how they do it. It does matter. And that’s why I would hope that the President and the Vice President all would wear a mask. They don’t wear a mask, why not? Other people should, so they should set an example. They have doctors around them all the time to minister to their very sneeze, but everybody else does not have that. And so it’s nothing that has any example to it that is good for stopping the spread of this.
A lot of people, as you know, many people are dying or older, that they’re predisposed. We are predisposed. But the fact is, and that’s very sad, my great fear is what you bring home to the children. And again, we want to take every precaution. I’ll end by just telling the story that one of my colleagues, Rashida Tlaib, told on the floor when we were passing CARES One. She showed the picture of a beautiful little girl, five years old. She died of coronavirus. She died of coronavirus. Her father is a firefighter, her mother’s a police officer. They weren’t tested. And then, of course, now they’re big advocates for testing. And this little girl, five years old. Can you just imagine if that happened in your home? It’s one thing to lose a parent. Okay, that’s important. It’s terrible. It’s awful. But as one in that category, rather me, of course, than my grandchildren. I’m sure every grandparent would say that. But the responsibility we all have to our family members, people take home whatever experience they had to their children or to their parents, their grandparents, or whatever. And the consequences could be some that are very sad for our country. Chuck Schumer and I wrote to the President this morning, did that go out? We wrote to the President this morning and said that as we observe Memorial Day, we recognize that that is a dedicated day reserved to honor our men and women in uniform who were willing to make the supreme sacrifice, the ultimate sacrifice, for our country. And we want to be respectful of that. But over this weekend or whenever it happens that we reach 100, 000 deaths that we want the flags across the country in public buildings to be flown at half staff. That was our request. And I hope the President will honor it. One death we carry in our hearts. 100,000 deaths, our hearts have to be full of love to always remember them. It’s a scar on our nation. But again, forgetting how we got here, let’s make sure we can minimize what happens in the future. But at the same time, I think the American people, I hear from my own constituents and from my colleagues, have a much needed expression of grief and recognition for the loss that is to our country.
Keep talking about John Donne, For Whom the Bell Tolls. “Every man’s death diminishes me because I am mankind.” He said man. Every person’s death diminishes me because I’m man. “For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.” This is a tremendous loss for our country. So let’s fight it. Testing, tracing, treatment, isolation. With a plan, strategic, definite, going into underserved communities, which are fearful to come forward because of the cost that might be incurred. But to remove all doubt that is in our nation’s history that everyone have access to that testing.
So happy 101 years since the House of Representatives voted for women to have the right to vote. California soon followed, we voted a year in advance of the country. I have to say proudly now that my colleagues are not here. Not to, I don’t know, but I know California.
So you’re okay. We celebrated it within the past year, in the 2019, again, 100 years before we passed it in California. And what’s sad is that one of the reasons I want to do this today is that so many of the events that we have planned in August, and hopefully we can still engage in them, celebrating women having the right to vote. When it happened, they said, the headlines, “Women given the right to vote.” No such thing, women fought and marched and starved and more starved and everything to get the right to vote. We owe them so much, not just the women owe them so much. America owes the suffragettes so much. And we thank the House of Representatives for taking the lead in the Congress on that. Thank you all very much. Wash your hands.

Harriet Harman,United Kingdom,2020-05-04,"This is a very important Bill, and much needed for tackling the horrific and often hidden crime of domestic violence. I completely agree with all the points that have been made by previous speakers on the Bill. The truth is that a lot of us have pushed for this Bill, but I do not think we would even be debating this today were it not for the former Prime Minister the right hon.
I strongly support the Bill, but there is one glaring omission, and that is what I want to speak about this afternoon. We need the Bill to tackle the problem of the defence being used by men who kill women and then say, “It’s a sex game gone wrong”. This is where a man kills a woman by strangling her or by forcing an object up inside her that causes her to bleed to death, and he acknowledges that these injuries killed her and that he caused them, but says it is not his fault—it is her fault; he was only doing what she wanted; it was a sex game gone wrong—and he literally gets away with murder. That is a double injustice. Not only does he kill, but he ​drags her name through the mud. It causes indescribable trauma for the bereaved family, who sit silently in court with the loss of a beloved daughter, sister and mother, to see the man who killed her describe luridly what he alleges are her sexual proclivities. She, of course, is not there to speak for herself. He kills her and then he defines her.
That is what happened to Natalie Connolly. I see that the hon. He was Natalie’s family’s MP. I urge everybody to listen very carefully to what he says about what happened in that case. Her brutal killer, John Broadhurst, escaped a murder charge by saying that it was what she wanted. We can stop that injustice. We can prohibit the rough sex gone wrong defence. We must do that by saying that if it is his hands on her neck strangling her, if it his hands that are pushing the object up inside her, then he must take responsibility. That is not a sex game gone wrong; that is murder and he cannot blame her for her own death.
There are two lessons that I think we have learned from previous struggles to improve the law on domestic violence and sexual offences. The first is that it always takes too long. This is the Bill in which this must happen. Secondly, it is never sorted until the law is changed. It will not be sorted by judicial training, by Crown Prosecution Service guidance or by a taskforce, welcome though they are. It will not be sorted by good intentions either; they are never enough. It needs a law change. I fully accept the Government’s good intentions. The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, the right hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins) and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. However, I say very directly to the Lord Chancellor that he is the man with the power here. He is the Government Minister and this is his Bill. I say to him, “Be the man who listens to what women are saying about this, not the man who knows better than us. Listen to what we are saying and make the change that we are asking for.”
",2020 Speech on the Domestic Abuse Bill,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/harriet-harman-2020-speech-on-the-domestic-abuse-bill/
George Turner,United Kingdom,2019-01-05,"I am grateful for the opportunity to make my maiden speech in the Budget debate. Budgets do much to determine the well-being of those who send us here and, rightly, strongly influence their judgment of us.
Before addressing any Budget issues directly, I wish to express to the House my personal delight at being here at all. I am greatly honoured that the people of North-West Norfolk have elected me. I should also like to follow the traditions of the House by mentioning my predecessors and by providing a brief sketch of my constituency—it is, after all, 33 years since a Labour Member has been able to do so.
Informed Members will know that, although somewhat camouflaged by a name change and minor boundary revisions, mine is one of the nation’s truly great historic constituencies. The name North-West Norfolk accurately describes the geography of the constituency, but King’s Lynn is indisputably the centre of it and gave the constituency its name for many years.
Sir Robert Walpole, the nation’s first Prime Minister, represented King’s Lynn in this place, and his family long dominated the politics of west Norfolk. Happily, not all the political customs of that time have survived to this day. However, the Walpole family motto, “Say what you think”, has strongly influenced many of those sent to represent my part of Norfolk in Parliament. Saying what one thinks has not always won friends in political circles, but it clearly expresses an expectation of the people of Norfolk—and particularly of my constituents. When in doubt, I follow its guidance and, to date at least, I have come to no harm—nay, I have had not even a rebuke from Excalibur itself.
I have known three of my immediate predecessors personally. At the beginning of my election campaign, I was particularly pleased to meet Derek Page—now in another place—who served from 1964 to 1970. He was the last Labour Member to represent the constituency—a fascinating man who became disillusioned with old Labour, but has now fully endorsed new Labour—and many in Norfolk recall his time with affection. When I met him, I felt that the baton had been handed to me to bring to this place and, for the first time, I felt that I would win the seat.
Derek lost his seat in 1970 to an equally interesting politician, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, who won the seat as a Conservative. He not only said what he thought but, in a moment of high drama in this Chamber, crossed the Floor of the House to join the newly born Social Democratic party. He narrowly lost his seat at the next election and, despite his substantial personal following in Norfolk, never realised his ambition to return to the House. Notably, he, too, now supports new Labour.
I hold out no hope for such conversion of my immediate predecessor, Mr. Henry Bellingham, who will be well known to Conservative Members as he served for 14 years on their Benches. They will know that he was, by word and by action, a most loyal supporter of the previous Government. Some say that his loyalty was penance for his ancestor John Bellingham who, just yards from where I stand, assassinated Prime Minister Spencer Perceval in 1812. In his maiden speech, Mr. Henry Bellingham declared an ambition to remove the blemish he felt that that dastardly act had attached to his family name. I hope that history will judge that he did so.
I am certainly pleased to take this opportunity to pay public tribute to Mr. Bellingham. In Norfolk, he was widely recognised for the pains that he took in handling constituency work. He went to great lengths on behalf of constituents with problems—whether pursuing officials of government or quango at a national or most local level. His efforts earned him considerable respect and affection within the constituency, and were certainly a factor in limiting my majority at the election. Interestingly, some officials have sought to dampen my enthusiasm for following Mr. Bellingham’s example and pursuing them on constituency issues. However, after only modest exposure to my new role, I am certain that nothing less will do in my part of Norfolk.
My constituency has many features worthy of note—not least the town of King’s Lynn, with its 1,000-year-old port and mediaeval, Elizabethan and Georgian architecture. Its port and fishing industries remain sources of employment, but they are surpassed today by the many small and medium-sized businesses to be found in the industrial estates that were mainly stimulated when the town had an overspill agreement with London.
Many will know my constituency for the beauty of its countryside and coastal regions. To the north lie marshes and superb sand beaches which provide natural havens for wildlife and joy to the discriminating visitor. There are many pleasing coastal villages, and the town of Hunstanton remains popular with a variety of visitors and family holiday-makers. More recently, those northern towns and villages, like many others in Norfolk, have attracted people who come to Norfolk at the end of their working lives seeking quality of life for their retirement.
A number of huge agricultural and sporting estates lie inland, and they are typical of those that were the very cradle of the agricultural revolution. There is also the royal residence on the beautiful Sandringham estate. Agriculture remains of considerable importance to Norfolk. Hon. Members may be interested to know that more than 200 years ago in the village of Heacham in my constituency agricultural workers gathered with their farming employers to petition Parliament for a minimum wage, which they wished to see linked to the price of corn.
My constituency also contains a marshland area to the west, much of which was reclaimed from the sea by Dutch engineers in the 17th and 18th centuries. It has a unique landscape, provides fertile soil and is divided by waterways. It is home to some of the nation’s finest and most fiercely independent horticulturists, fruit growers and small farmers.
My constituency has almost 100 towns, villages and hamlets. It has a rich variety of landscapes, activities and people. It is home to some of the richest and some of the poorest in our land. It is certainly one of the most rural constituencies in England to be represented by a Labour Member. The House will understand that it is a particular honour for me to be here tonight representing North-West Norfolk.
However, let me not leave the House with the impression that I represent a rural idyll. Many important needs of my constituents have been much neglected for many years. I am glad that the Budget addresses many of those issues. Unemployment, including that of young people, remains at intolerable levels. Even in Lynn, where rationalisation has led to job losses, there are far too many low-skill, low-wage jobs. Many of our villages lack well-paid employment for people who historically looked to the land for work. In the 30 years that I have lived in Norfolk, there has been a dramatic decline in the numbers required to work large estates.
As the previous chairman of the education committee, I know all too well that too many of Norfolk’s school buildings require major investment. The county has suffered from an historically low spend on education. The road network in Norfolk, particularly the A47 strategic link, still cries out for improvement and tightly constrains economic development. I have also recently had to inform Ministers that the plight of our fishing fleet requires urgent attention. Rural poverty is every bit as debilitating as its urban equivalent. It will be my priority to see that the urgent needs of my constituents are given proper regard in the deliberations of the House and in the decisions of Ministers.
Hon. Members will gather that I am pleased to give a warm welcome to the Budget. Through the windfall tax, it addresses the need to help many people, especially the young in my constituency, to find work. It deals with the problems of our schools and of the health service. Importantly, it keeps the election promises that I made. After a weekend in Norfolk talking to my constituents, I politely warn Conservative Members that by asserting otherwise they will earn themselves a reputation for veracity in opposition no better than that which bedevilled their latter years in government.
I bring a warm welcome for the Budget from Norfolk with but one caveat. The right hon. People who live in villages where they count the number of buses per week rather than per hour view differently the stick of extra taxes, however green the purpose and however well intentioned the Chancellor imposing them. During the lifetime of this Parliament, it will be essential to use broader measures—both carrot and stick, not just stick—to ensure that the interests of rural people are properly reflected in Budget decisions. I look forward to Ministers providing that range of policies.
I hope that I shall not be too controversial if I say a few words about advance corporation tax and pensions, a subject which seems to vex many Conservative Members. I have been a trustee of a pension fund and for many years I have repaid my mortgage through a personal equity plan. I have made it my business at least to try to understand some of the effects of advance corporation tax. If one is to judge the merits not of imposing a tax—which is how Conservative Members refer to it—but of removing a tax benefit, the question that one should ask is why one would introduce such a tax benefit if it did not exist. The answer is that one would not.
If the Chancellor is to take money from people to give tax advantages for certain forms of behaviour, the correct way to do so is to give the tax incentive to the individual who will save the money. We should not try to do so through pension funding by reason of contortions in logic. That is too remote from the pressures that can be put on individuals to recognise the benefits of thrift and saving for their pensions.
I carefully investigated the actions of the previous Government when they reduced the level of ACT from 25 to 20 per cent. At that time, I read in the newspapers—the same ones that I read this weekend—the dreadful predictions of how much more I would have to put into my PEP. Those predictions were wrong: my PEP has gone up by 35 per cent. whereas they referred to effects at 2 or 3 per cent. My PEP has gone up by 35 per cent. because what really matters to people is our country’s economic well-being, not jiggering around with pensions because of tax considerations. What matters is good, sound management and sound judgment of areas in which to invest both in this country and internationally.
I believe that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor is right in trying to stoke the boiler of the train we are on so that we all move faster, while Conservative Members are in danger of having an academic argument about how we move up and down the corridors of the train: if one walks forward up the train, one may gain time, but really to gain time one must get the train to move faster. History will judge that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has made a sound judgment in his Budget proposals.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-07-17,"About what?
No. If people want to leave our country they can. If they don't want to love our country. If they don't want to fight for our country they can. I'll never change on that. No.
I do think I'm winning the political fight. I'm winning it by a lot.
I think that they are not espousing the needs of our country these four Congresswoman. I think that they said horrible things and the press doesn't cover it. You should try covering it. When you look at some of the things they said they're unthinkable. If somebody else or me or anybody else said things like that it would be historic.
So, you ought to look at some of the horrible things said because it's never been said before.
Well, the democratic party is really going in a direction that nobody thought possible. They are going to so far left they are going to fall off a cliff. So I think they are making a big mistake. But who knows that is up to them.
Well, there is a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother. I know nothing about it. I hear she was married to her brother. You're asking me a question about it. I don't know but I'm sure that somebody will be able to look into that.
Well, I think the story last night was at 187 republicans voted in favor of Trump and 4 voted against. I think that was the big story. That seems to be the story. Great community in the republican party. Very unfair what has happened with respect to the way I would say republicans are being treated, frankly, but certainly the way -- certainly the way this president has been treated.
In the history of our country there has never been anything like this and this should never be allowed to happen to another president again. Should never be allowed to happen. Despite that we've created the greatest economy in the history of our country. We are doing things like nobody has ever done. And we have the best job numbers in the history of our country -- African American, Asian American, women, Hispanic American -- best job numbers we've ever had.
And I have to go because I see it starting to pour.
I'm not relishing the fight. I'm enjoying it because I have to get the word out to the American people and you have to enjoy what you do. I enjoy what I do. The key is -- the key is it's not a question of relishing. They're wrong. They're absolutely wrong. That's not where our country wants to be. We're not going to go and we're not going to be a socialist country.
It's not going to happen.
",Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to the Press Before Marine One Departure,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-marine-one-departure-july-16-2019
Barack Obama,United States of America,2013-08-09,"Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve been talking about what I believe should be our number-one priority as a country -- building a better bargain for the middle class and for Americans who want to work their way into the middle class. At the same time, I’m focused on my number-one responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, and that's keeping the American people safe. And in recent days, we’ve been reminded once again about the threats to our nation.
As Isaid at the National Defense University back in May, in meeting those threats we have to strike the right balance between protecting our security and preserving our freedoms. And as part of this rebalancing, I called for a review of our surveillance programs. Unfortunately, rather than an orderly and lawful process to debate these issues and come up with appropriate reforms, repeated leaks of classified information have initiated the debate in a very passionate, but not always fully informed way.
Now, keep in mind that as a senator, I expressed a healthy skepticism about these programs, and as President, I’ve taken steps to make sure they have strong oversight by all three branches of government and clear safeguards to prevent abuse and protect the rights of the American people. But given the history of abuse by governments, it’s right to ask questions about surveillance -- particularly as technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives.
I’m also mindful of how these issues are viewed overseas, because American leadership around the world depends upon the example of American democracy and American openness -- because what makes us different from other countries is not simply our ability to secure our nation, it’s the way we do it -- with open debate and democratic process.
In other words, it’s not enough for me, as President, to have confidence in these programs. The American people need to have confidence in them as well. And that's why, over the last few weeks, I’ve consulted members of Congress who come at this issue from many different perspectives. I’ve asked the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to review where our counterterrorism efforts and our values come into tension, and I directed my national security team to be more transparent and to pursue reforms of our laws and practices.
And so, today, I’d like to discuss four specific steps -- not all inclusive, but some specific steps that we’re going to be taking very shortly to move the debate forward.
First, I will work with Congress to pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the Patriot Act -- the program that collects telephone records. As I’ve said, this program is an important tool in our effort to disrupt terrorist plots. And it does not allow the government to listen to any phone calls without a warrant. But given the scale of this program, I understand the concerns of those who would worry that it could be subject to abuse. So after having a dialogue with members of Congress and civil libertarians, I believe that there are steps we can take to give the American people additional confidence that there are additional safeguards against abuse.
For instance, we can take steps to put in place greater oversight, greater transparency, and constraints on the use of this authority. So I look forward to working with Congress to meet those objectives.
Second, I’ll work with Congress to improve the public’s confidence in the oversight conducted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISC. The FISC was created by Congress to provide judicial review of certain intelligence activities so that a federal judge must find that our actions are consistent with the Constitution. However, to build greater confidence, I think we should consider some additional changes to the FISC.
One of the concerns that people raise is that a judge reviewing a request from the government to conduct programmatic surveillance only hears one side of the story -- may tilt it too far in favor of security, may not pay enough attention to liberty. And while I’ve got confidence in the court and I think they’ve done a fine job, I think we can provide greater assurances that the court is looking at these issues from both perspectives -- security and privacy.
So, specifically, we can take steps to make sure civil liberties concerns have an independent voice in appropriate cases by ensuring that the government’s position is challenged by an adversary.
Number three, we can, and must, be more transparent. So I’ve directed the intelligence community to make public as much information about these programs as possible. We’ve already declassified unprecedented information about the NSA, but we can go further. So at my direction, the Department of Justice will make public the legal rationale for the government’s collection activities under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The NSA is taking steps to put in place a full-time civil liberties and privacy officer, and released information that details its mission, authorities, and oversight. And finally, the intelligence community is creating a website that will serve as a hub for further transparency, and this will give Americans and the world the ability to learn more about what our intelligence community does and what it doesn’t do, how it carries out its mission, and why it does so.
Fourth, we’re forming a high-level group of outside experts to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies. We need new thinking for a new era. We now have to unravel terrorist plots by finding a needle in the haystack of global telecommunications. And meanwhile, technology has given governments -- including our own -- unprecedented capability to monitor communications.
So I am tasking this independent group to step back and review our capabilities -- particularly our surveillance technologies. And they’ll consider how we can maintain the trust of the people, how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used, ask how surveillance impacts our foreign policy -- particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public. And they will provide an interim report in 60 days and a final report by the end of this year, so that we can move forward with a better understanding of how these programs impact our security, our privacy, and our foreign policy.
So all these steps are designed to ensure that the American people can trust that our efforts are in line with our interests and our values. And to others around the world, I want to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people. Our intelligence is focused, above all, on finding the information that’s necessary to protect our people, and -- in many cases -- protect our allies.
It’s true we have significant capabilities. What’s also true is we show a restraint that many governments around the world don't even think to do, refuse to show -- and that includes, by the way, some of America’s most vocal critics. We shouldn’t forget the difference between the ability of our government to collect information online under strict guidelines and for narrow purposes, and the willingness of some other governments to throw their own citizens in prison for what they say online.
And let me close with one additional thought. The men and women of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe because they love this country and believe in our values. They're patriots. And I believe that those who have lawfully raised their voices on behalf of privacy and civil liberties are also patriots who love our country and want it to live up to our highest ideals. So this is how we’re going to resolve our differences in the United States -- through vigorous public debate, guided by our Constitution, with reverence for our history as a nation of laws, and with respect for the facts.
So, with that, I’m going to take some questions. And let’s see who we’ve got here. We’re going to start with Julie Pace of AP.
It is true that in my first four years, in working with President Medvedev, we made a lot of progress. We got START done -- or START II done. We were able to cooperate together on Iran sanctions. They provided us help in terms of supplying our troops in Afghanistan. We were able to get Russia into the WTO -- which is not just good for Russia, it’s good for our companies and businesses because they're more likely then to follow international norms and rules. So there's been a lot of good work that has been done and that is going to continue to be done. What's also true is, is that when President Putin -- who was prime minister when Medvedev was president -- came back into power I think we saw more rhetoric on the Russian side that was anti-American, that played into some of the old stereotypes about the Cold War contests between the United States and Russia. And I've encouraged Mr. Putin to think forward as opposed to backwards on those issues -- with mixed success.
And I think the latest episode is just one more in a number of emerging differences that we've seen over the last several months around Syria, around human rights issues, where it is probably appropriate for us to take a pause, reassess where it is that Russia is going, what our core interests are, and calibrate the relationship so that we're doing things that are good for the United States and hopefully good for Russia as well, but recognizing that there just are going to be some differences and we're not going to be able to completely disguise them.
And that's okay. Keep in mind that although I'm not attending the summit, I'll still be going to St. Petersburg because Russia is hosting the G20. That's important business in terms of our economy and our jobs and all the issues that are of concern to Americans.
I know that one question that's been raised is how do we approach the Olympics. I want to just make very clear right now I do not think it's appropriate to boycott the Olympics. We've got a bunch of Americans out there who are training hard, who are doing everything they can to succeed. Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing in Russia. But as I said just this week, I've spoken out against that not just with respect to Russia but a number of other countries where we continue to do work with them, but we have a strong disagreement on this issue.
And one of the things I'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we're seeing there. And if Russia doesn't have gay or lesbian athletes, then it probably makes their team weaker.
We're going to assess where the relationship can advance U.S. interests and increase peace and stability and prosperity around the world. Where it can, we’re going to keep on working with them. Where we have differences, we’re going to say so clearly. And my hope is, is that over time, Mr. Putin and Russia recognize that rather than a zero-sum competition, in fact, if the two countries are working together we can probably advance the betterment of both peoples.
Chuck Todd.
So the issue here really has to do with where do they want to take Russia -- it’s substantive on a policy front. And --
See, now I’ve forgotten your first question, which presumably was the more important one. No, I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot. As I said in my opening remarks, I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.
My preference -- and I think the American people’s preference -- would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws, a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place. Because I never made claims that all the surveillance technologies that have developed since the time some of these laws had been put in place somehow didn't require potentially some additional reforms. That's exactly what I called for.
So the fact is, is that Mr. Snowden has been charged with three felonies. If, in fact, he believes that what he did was right, then, like every American citizen, he can come here, appear before the court with a lawyer and make his case. If the concern was that somehow this was the only way to get this information out to the public, I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistleblower protection to the intelligence community -- for the first time. So there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions.
But having said that, once the leaks have happened, what we’ve seen is information come out in dribs and in drabs, sometimes coming out sideways. Once the information is out, the administration comes in, tries to correct the record. But by that time, it’s too late or we’ve moved on, and a general impression has, I think, taken hold not only among the American public but also around the world that somehow we’re out there willy-nilly just sucking in information on everybody and doing what we please with it.
That's not the case. Our laws specifically prohibit us from surveilling U.S. persons without a warrant. And there are a whole range of safeguards that have been put in place to make sure that that basic principle is abided by.
But what is clear is that whether, because of the instinctive bias of the intelligence community to keep everything very close -- and probably what’s a fair criticism is my assumption that if we had checks and balances from the courts and Congress, that that traditional system of checks and balances would be enough to give people assurance that these programs were run probably -- that assumption I think proved to be undermined by what happened after the leaks. I think people have questions about this program.
And so, as a consequence, I think it is important for us to go ahead and answer these questions. What I’m going to be pushing the IC to do is rather than have a trunk come out here and leg come out there and a tail come out there, let’s just put the whole elephant out there so people know exactly what they're looking at. Let’s examine what is working, what’s not, are there additional protections that can be put in place, and let’s move forward.
And there’s no doubt that Mr. Snowden’s leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through, and I had sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through. It would have been less exciting. It would not have generated as much press. I actually think we would have gotten to the same place, and we would have done so without putting at risk our national security and some very vital ways that we are able to get intelligence that we need to secure the country.
Major Garrett.
I have a range of outstanding candidates. You’ve mentioned two of them -- Mr. Summers and Mr. Yellen -- Ms. Yellen. And they're both terrific people.
I think the perception that Mr. Summers might have an inside track simply had to do with a bunch of attacks that I was hearing on Mr. Summers preemptively, which is sort of a standard Washington exercise, that I don't like. Because when somebody has worked hard for me and worked hard on behalf of the American people, and I know the quality of those people, and I see them getting slapped around in the press for no reason -- before they’ve even been nominated for anything -- then I want to make sure that somebody is standing up for them. I felt the same way when people were attacking Susan Rice before she was nominated for anything. So I tend to defend folks who I think have done a good job and don't deserve attacks.
But I consider them both outstanding candidates. My main criteria -- I’ve stated this before, but I want to repeat it -- my main criteria for the Fed Reserve chairman is somebody who understands they’ve got a dual mandate. A critical part of the job is making sure that we keep inflation in check, that our monetary policy is sound, that the dollar is sound. Those are all critical components of the job. And we’ve seen what happens when the Fed is not paying attention. We saw, prior to Paul Volcker coming into place, inflation shooting up in ways that really damaged the real economy.
But the other mandate is full employment. And right now, if you look at the biggest challenges we have, the challenge is not inflation; the challenge is we’ve still got too many people out of work, too many long-term unemployed, too much slack in the economy, and we’re not growing as fast as we should. And so I want a Fed chairman who’s able to look at those issues and have a perspective that keeps an eye on inflation, makes sure that we’re not seeing artificial bubbles in place, but also recognizing, you know what, a big part of my job right now is to make sure the economy is growing quickly and robustly, and is sustained and durable, so that people who work hard in this country are able to find a job.
And, frankly, I think both Larry Summers and Janet Yellen are highly qualified candidates. There are a couple of other candidates who are highly qualified as well. I’ll make the decision in the fall.
Carol Lee. And, Carol, congratulations on Hudson.
I wanted to ask you about your evolution on the surveillance issues. I mean, part of what you’re talking about today is restoring the public trust. And the public has seen you evolve from when you were in the U.S. Senate to now. And even as recently as June, you said that the process was such that people should be comfortable with it, and now you’re saying you’re making these reforms and people should be comfortable with those. So why should the public trust you on this issue, and why did you change your position multiple times?
And if you look at the reports -- even the disclosures that Mr. Snowden has put forward -- all the stories that have been written, what you're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's emails. What you're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused. Now, part of the reason they're not abused is because these checks are in place, and those abuses would be against the law and would be against the orders of the FISC.
Having said that, though, if you are outside of the intelligence community, if you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying, U.S.-Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, et cetera, well, understandably, people would be concerned. I would be, too, if I wasn't inside the government.
And so in light of the changed environment where a whole set of questions have been raised, some in the most sensationalized manner possible, where these leaks are released drip by drip, one a week, to kind of maximize attention and see if they can catch us at some imprecision on something -- in light of that, it makes sense for us to go ahead, lay out what exactly we're doing, have a discussion with Congress, have a discussion with industry -- which is also impacted by this -- have a discussion with civil libertarians, and see can we do this better.
I think the main thing I want to emphasize is I don't have an interest and the people at the NSA don't have an interest in doing anything other than making sure that where we can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, that we're able to carry out that critical task. We do not have an interest in doing anything other than that. And we've tried to set up a system that is as failsafe as so far at least we've been able to think of to make sure that these programs are not abused.
But people may have better ideas and people may want to jigger slightly sort of the balance between the information that we can get versus the incremental encroachments on privacy that if haven't already taken place might take place in a future administration, or as technologies develop further.
And the other thing that’s happening is, is that as technology develops further, technology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So, for example, if people don’t have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress are sufficient to give us confidence that government is not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological fixes that provide another layer of assurance.
And so those are the kinds of things that I’m looking forward to having a conversation about.
If I tell Michelle that I did the dishes -- now, granted, in the White House I don’t do the dishes that much -- but back in the day -- and she’s a little skeptical, well, I’d like her to trust me, but maybe I need to bring her back and show her the dishes and not just have her take my word for it.
And so the program is -- I am comfortable that the program currently is not being abused. I’m comfortable that if the American people examined exactly what was taking place, how it was being used, what the safeguards were, that they would say, you know what, these folks are following the law and doing what they say they’re doing.
But it is absolutely true that with the expansion of technology -- this is an area that’s moving very quickly -- with the revelations that have depleted public trust, that if there are some additional things that we can do to build that trust back up, then we should do them.
Jonathan Karl.
And I’d refer you back to that speech just back in May where I said specifically that although they are less likely to be able to carry out spectacular homeland attacks like 9/11, they have the capacity to go after our embassies. They have the capacity, potentially, to go after our businesses. They have the capacity to be destabilizing and disruptive in countries where the security apparatus is weak. And that’s exactly what we are seeing right now.
So it’s entirely consistent to say that this tightly organized and relatively centralized al Qaeda that attacked us on 9/11 has been broken apart and is very weak and does not have a lot of operational capacity, and to say we still have these regional organizations like AQAP that can pose a threat, that can drive potentially a truck bomb into an embassy wall and can kill some people.
And so that requires us, then, to make sure that we have a strategy that is strengthening those partners so that they’ve got their own capacity to deal with what are potentially manageable regional threats if these countries are a little bit stronger and have more effective CT and so forth. It means that we’ve got to continue to be vigilant and go after known terrorists who are potentially carrying out plots or are going to strengthen their capacity over time -- because they’re always testing the boundaries of, well, maybe we can try this, maybe we can do that. So this is a ongoing process. We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is to weaken it and to strengthen our partnerships in such a way that it does not pose the kind of horrible threat that we saw on 9/11.
And I’m not going to discuss specific operations that have taken place. Again, in my speech in May, I was very specific about how we make these determinations about potential lethal strikes, so I would refer you to that speech.
Ed Henry.
And on September 11th we’ll have the first anniversary of Benghazi. And you said on September 12th, “Make no mistake, we’ll bring to justice the killers who attacked our people.” Eleven months later, where are they, sir?
With respect to health care, I didn’t simply choose to delay this on my own. This was in consultation with businesses all across the country, many of whom are supportive of the Affordable Care Act, but -- and many of whom, by the way, are already providing health insurance to their employees but were concerned about the operational details of changing their HR operations, if they’ve got a lot of employees, which could be costly for them, and them suggesting that there may be easier ways to do this.
Now, what’s true, Ed, is, is that in a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the Speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law -- it has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify the attestation of employers as to whether they’re already providing health insurance or not -- it looks like there may be some better ways to do this; let's make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do.
But we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to ""Obamacare."" We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation. Let me tell you what is the core of implementation that's already taken place. As we speak, right now, for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they are benefiting from being able to keep their kid on their plan if their kid is 26 or younger. That's benefiting millions of young people around the country, which is why lack of insurance among young people has actually gone down. That's in large part attributable to the steps that we've taken.
You've got millions of people who have received rebates, because part of the Affordable Care Act was to say that if an insurance company isn't spending 80 percent of your premium on your health care, you get some money back. And, lo and behold, people have been getting their money back. It means that folks who have been bumping up with lifetime limits on their insurance, that it leaves them vulnerable. That doesn't exist.
Seniors have been getting discounts on their prescription drugs. That's happening right now. Free preventive care -- mammograms, contraception. That's happening right now. I met a young man today on a bill signing I was doing with the student loan bill who came up to me and said thank you -- he couldn't have been more than 25, 26 years old -- thank you; I have cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act working with the California program, I was able to get health care and I'm now in remission. And so right now people are already benefiting.
Now, what happens on October 1st, in 53 days, is for the remaining 15 percent of the population that doesn’t have health insurance, they're going to be able to go on a website or call up a call center and sign up for affordable quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market. And if even with lower premiums they still can't afford it, we're going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it. And between October 1st into March there will be an open enrollment period in which millions of Americans for the first time are going to be able to get affordable health care.
Now, I think the really interesting question is why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their number-one priority. The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits I just mentioned -- kids staying on their parents' plan; seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs; I guess a return to lifetime limits on insurance; people with preexisting conditions continuing to be blocked from being able to get health insurance.
That's hard to understand as an agenda that is going to strengthen our middle class. At least they used to say, well, we're going to replace it with something better. There’s not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.
The notion is simply that those 30 million people, or the 150 million who are benefiting from the other aspects of Affordable Care, will be better off without it. That's their assertion -- not backed by fact, not backed by any evidence. It’s just become an ideological fixation.
Well, I tell you what, they're wrong about that. There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say, you know what, we should have thought of that earlier. Or this would work a little bit better. Or this needs an adjustment. That was true of Social Security. That was true of Medicare. That was true of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. That was true of the prescription drug program, Part D, that was rolled out by a Republican President and supported by Republicans who are still in the House of Representatives. That's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. It’s true of Apple rolling out the new iPad.
So you will be able to, whenever you want during the course of the next six months and probably the next year, find occasions where you say, ah-ha, you know what, that could have been done a little bit better. Or that thing, they're kind of making an administrative change; that's now how it was originally thought this thing was going to work. Yes, exactly. Because our goal is to actually deliver high-quality, affordable health care for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck. And I make no apologies for that.
And let me just make one last point about this. The idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea. What you should be thinking about is how can we advance and improve ways for middle-class families to have some security so that if they work hard, they can get ahead and their kids can get ahead.
Jessica Yellin.
Again, they used to say they had a replacement. That never actually arrived, right? I mean, I’ve been hearing about this whole replacement thing for two years -- now I just don’t hear about it, because basically they don’t have an agenda to provide health insurance to people at affordable rates. And the idea that you would shut down the government at a time when the recovery is getting some traction; where we’re growing, although not as fast as we need to; where the housing market is recovering, although not as fast as we would like; that we would precipitate another crisis here in Washington that no economist thinks is a good idea -- I’m assuming that they will not take that path. I have confidence that common sense, in the end, will prevail.
Okay. Scott Horseley.
We know that the Senate bill strengthens border security, puts unprecedented resources on top of the unprecedented resources I’ve already put into border security. So if your main priority is border security, I’d think you’d want to vote for this bill. We know that the Senate bill creates a system in which employers are held accountable for when they hire undocumented workers. This is something that people say is a bad thing. I agree. Let’s make sure that that system for holding employers accountable is in place.
So when I hear the opposition to immigration reform, I just run through the list of things they’re concerned about, I look at what the Senate bill does, and I say to myself, you know what, the Senate bill actually improves the situation on every issue that they say they’re concerned about.
Now, what they may argue is it doesn’t solve the problem 100 percent. I don’t know a law that solves a problem 100 percent. Social Security lifted millions of seniors out of poverty, but there are still some poor seniors. The Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act drastically reduced discrimination in America, but there’s still discrimination. That doesn’t make them bad laws, it just means that there are very few human problems that are 100 percent solvable.
So what I see right now is a strong bipartisan vote coming out of the Senate. I think that the Speaker and others have said they need to do something, and I’d urge, when they get back, to do something -- put forward a bill that has an opportunity to actually pass. It may not be precisely what’s in the Senate bill. My preference would be for them to go ahead and call the Senate bill. But if they’ve got some additional ideas, I think the Senate is happy to consider them. And get that bill on the floor, put it up for a vote.
I am absolutely certain that the votes for the Senate bill -- which strengthens border security; demands responsibility from undocumented workers to pay a fine, pay a penalty and get to the back of the line; reforms our legal immigration system; holds employers accountable -- I am absolutely confident that if that bill was on the floor of the House, it would pass.
So the challenge right now is not that there aren’t a majority of House members, just like a majority of Senate members, who aren’t prepared to support this bill. The problem is internal Republican caucus politics. And that’s what the American people don’t want us to be worrying about. Don’t worry about your Washington politics. Solve problems.
And this is one where you’ve actually got some pretty broad consensus. I don’t know an issue where you’ve got labor, the Chamber of Commerce, evangelicals, student groups -- you name it -- supportive of a bill. Let’s get it done.
Thank you very much, everybody.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2015-01-26,"Hello, Greta.
He is not a closer. He was not able to close the deal. He should have been able to. We had a president that was doing terribly, as bad as you are going to do, and he should have won. And many Republicans would have won. And he was not able to close the deal. And certainly, the Republicans cannot be so stupid as to give him a second crack because honestly he choked.
He wasn't able to get it done. He should have been able to get it done. There is no excuse for it. And you cannot give that person a second chance, unfortunately.
It's a huge negative. The Bush name is not exactly hot right now. I think it's a very, very big negative. He is very weak on immigration. He is for Common Core, which, for is a Republican, I can tell, it is not a positive thing. I think he wouldn't get elected. I don't think he would beat Hillary or whoever it may be.
Well, he wants to change us around to a different system than what we are supposed to be in this country. He wants to go very different route. And I said that very strongly. And I got, as you know, more standing ovations by far than anybody else, and that was one of them.
He is either grossly incompetent or he wants to go in a different situation. He wants to give away the free enterprise system. He wants to have a system that does not mesh well with what we are about, and certainly what the Republicans are all about.
Socialism and anti-capitalism and lots of other things, yes.
I am very, very seriously considering it. I could make America great again. We have tremendous potential. We're not using it. Politicians are all talk, no action. I have been watching them for years. I was doing well last anytime. I could have done something. In a way, I have a regret. I did what I had to do when I backed Mitt and Mitt let us down and that was very unfortunate.
But I can tell you this. We have tremendous potential as a country. We don't use it. We are falling behind. China is now the one -- the number-one economic engine, economic country, which is unthinkable if you go back 10 years. Unthinkable that a thing like that could happen. And, again, we have the ability in this country to truly be a great one again.
Right now, we are falling so far behind.
I would be willing to do it. ""The Apprentice"" is doing fantastically well. Miss Universe, last night, is doing -- you saw the Nielsen ratings. They were through the roof. And all of that. But obviously, the country is far more important. And I can do things that other people can't do. I can do things that the other Republicans candidate and, frankly, the Democratic candidates can't do. One of the things we have to do is stop with this tremendous flow of people just walking right into the country.
We don't know who they are, where they come from. They just walk right across our southern border. And who builds a better wall than Donald Trump? I build the best buildings. And believe me, I would build a wall that is not penetrable. That would be a wall that they are not going to be stepping over.
And we have to do that. We have to stop this influx because it's killing our country.
Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-10-06,"Thank you very much. It's an honor to be here with the great men and women of American manufacturing. In a few moments, I will sign a presidential proclamation declaring today National Manufacturing Day.
From the founding of our nation, from Washington to Jefferson, from Jackson to McKinley, our nation has long understood that our strength as a country depends upon the strength of our domestic industry.
We're all better off when we make, buy, and sell more products made in the USA. And that's what's happening in our country, and you see it. And the levels of enthusiasm are incredible.
Today and in coming weeks, manufacturers in all 50 states will hold events to encourage more Americans to pursue a career in high tech and the high-tech world of modern manufacturing. My administration strongly supports that goal, and we've been supporting it for a long time.
nd it's really, now, starting to pay off as everybody behind me knows. And that's why I've asked members of my Cabinet to travel across the country, share our message, and meet with the workers. And they're hard workers.
We've also already created tens of thousands of new manufacturing jobs. Plants and companies are coming back into our country. You see it with announcements now from automobile companies to every kind of company.
They're coming back in and, perhaps, even more importantly, they don't want to leave anymore because they know they're leaving a very good thing. So we're creating thousands more jobs.
And if Congress acts on our historic tax cut, the largest in the history of our country, and also tax reform and that framework that we've put forward, it will be even more so.
Under the current law, products made in America are taxed at a marginal rate of 35 percent, and really, sometimes much higher than that, putting our manufacturers at a tremendous disadvantage to the manufacturers in other countries.
We want to dramatically reduce the tax on American manufacturers so that we can compete and win on the world stage.
And I will tell you, the receptivity to what we're proposing is fantastic. We're keeping our companies, and the companies are coming back in. And perhaps, most importantly, we're making our workers happy, and they love to work.
So I want to thank everybody for being here. And maybe a couple of folks behind me would want to say a few words. Would you like to say something?
That's very great. You bring up a very good point. We've cut regulations more than any administration there is. We have -- nobody is even close, and we're talking about in 10 months we've cut more regulations than any President, any administration, and we have a long way to go.
We're cutting down so that highways don't take 20 years to build and other things don't take decades and decades and then find out, in many cases after going through the process, that they can't build it anyway. So we've cut regulations more than has ever been cut before. And we are continuing.
At the same time, I like regulation. It's fine. We want clean air. We want crystal-clear water. What we want also is we want safety. But there's a point at which we have to take care of our country, and we have to take care of our workers and our companies.
So we're very honored, and that's a great point that you bring up with regulations. Thank you very much. Anybody else? Anybody? Yes.
Thank you very much. That's very nice. That's really nice. Anybody else want to say anything? Anybody? You'll become very famous if you do.
Yes, Jay. Jay Timmons.
I knew about the survey. I didn't want to bring it up.
Thank you, Jay. That's great. Thank you very much. Okay. So this is our proclamation, and this in honor of our great National Manufacturing Day.
And the tremendous success we've been having, especially over the last nine months. There's been a big difference.
That's right.
And they will be. It's happening. Thank you very much, Jay. Appreciate it.
So the big question is: Who gets the pen? What do you think? Should we do it, Jay?
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
You'll find out.
We'll see. Thank you, everybody.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Signs a National Manufacturing Day Proclamations,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-national-manufacturing-proclamation-october-6-2017
Ed Miliband,United Kingdom,2015-12-09,"One year ago the Liberal Democrats told voters in Newcastle that they would fight for the next generation to get fair chances, for families struggling to get by and to strengthen the ties that bind our communities together.
That is what Nick Clegg told the people of Britain exactly one year ago when he looked viewers in the eye during in that first historic TV debate and promised a different kind of politics.
But the Lib Dems have broken their promises.
A year ago the Lib Dems promised to scrap tuition fees. But they trebled them.
A year ago, the Lib Dems promised to oppose a rise in VAT. But they voted to back the Tories in raising it to 20 per cent.
A year ago, the Lib Dems promised to protect the NHS. But they backed David Cameron’s expensive bureaucratic plans which put the founding principles of the heath service at risk.
A year ago, the Lib Dems promised to support measured deficit reduction plans. But they backed Tory cuts that go £40 billion further and faster than those Labour would have made.
What a difference a year makes.
Today I want to make a direct appeal to people who voted Liberal Democrat in past elections.
Some may have voted Labour before, others not.
But day-by-day it’s becoming clearer the Liberal Democrats can no longer claim to represent the values for which so many voted at the last election.
I know that some people in the Lib Dem leadership like to claim they are making a difference inside this Conservative-led Government.
But the truth is that the Liberal Democrats are not front seat passengers or back seat passengers in this Conservative-led Government . They are locked in the boot of a vehicle which is travelling rapidly in the wrong direction.
We may have heard some shouting coming from that boot in recent days. There is, after all, an election on. But it isn’t changing either the speed or the way this Government is headed. Too many people who thought they were voting for a progressive party a year ago have been betrayed.
There may still be three main parties standing candidates but there are only two directions for our country
There is the Labour way: standing up for young people, for students, for sure start, for the next generation; standing up for families feeling squeezed; standing up for strong, safe communities.
And there is the Tory-Liberal Democrat way. Cuts that go too far, too fast. Cuts that are not only unfair on cities like Newcastle but which also threaten the jobs and the economic recovery we need.
Labour is standing up for your values. We would tax bank bonuses, not give the bankers a tax cut. We would not have imposed a VAT rise on families feeling the squeeze. We would have made sensible cuts at a speed which protects jobs and services rather than supporting reckless cuts that go too far too fast. We support  the NHS. We support keeping police on the street. We support giving our young people a fair chance in life.
I believe these are the values of the majority of voters in this country.
If these are your values, let Labour be your voice in these tough times.

So, we're coming in and we're landing and I say, ""You know, I have a choice: I can stay on the plane and relax as we fuel up, right? As we fuel up."" Or, I said, ""How good are they out there?"" Somebody looked at me and said, ""They're the best."" You're supposed to the best, right?
You're right on the front."" Put on the tie. Put on the shirt. But I wanted to be with you. And it's an honor to be with you, I have to tell you. Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, right now, at ease. Let's have a little fun, right.
We'll have a little fun. Listen to you. You are something. Well, I want to thank General Tom Bussiere for the introduction, and done a really great job. Highly respected man. I know the ones that are highly respected and I know we have some others. But usually when you get to general, you're right up there.
But he's done a fantastic job. And, General, thank you very much. Appreciate it very much for the introduction. And also, I want to thank all of the folks with the NORAD. And when we talk NORAD, we're talking about big stuff. I learned so much about NORAD so many years ago, studying different things. You know, I love -- I love this world.
And, actually, over here, my grandfather was up in Alaska for a long time. He was looking for gold. He was searching for gold. He didn’t find it, but he started opening up little hotels for those looking for gold, and it worked out. But he was up in -- and maybe that's why I've always had a very special place in my heart for Alaska.
And when election time came along, somehow the people of Alaska knew that and they voted very, very -- it wasn't even a little bit close. So I just really appreciated that always. And, you know, it's a very special place. And I don't know if some of the folks -- the military folks care about this, but the people of Alaska really care about it. I just approved, recently -- and almost one of my earlier acts in office, ANWR, which is one of the largest deposits anywhere in the world.
And for many, many years they've been trying to get it approved, since before Ronald Reagan. And they couldn't get it done. And we were just talking to your great governor. He is doing a very special job. And he said, ""We really appreciate that you got that done."" And we got some other things done for Alaska too.
But when you look at that, ANWR is one of -- if you're in the oil industry you know a lot about ANWR. One of the most important finds anywhere. They just couldn't do anything about it, but now we can. So that's going to be great. But I also -- and I mentioned Mike Dunleavy. I just want to say he has been an incredible warrior.
He ran an incredible campaign. He won easily. He's not only one of the best governors in the United States; he's definitely the largest. Where is Mike? Look at that man. He's all man. Look at him. Congratulations, Mike, and thank you for being here. He heard I was going to stop, and he got on a plane and he was able to get here.
And that's a great honor. It's always nice though -- when you endorse somebody, it's always nice when they want to be there when you make a speech, right? And he's always there. He's there anyway and he's done an incredible job for Alaska. And I will tell you, in front of all of these great troops, I'll say: Mike, anytime you have a problem, you call me. You know that, okay?
And we'll take care of it for Alaska. Right? You know that. As you know, I'm on my way back from Vietnam. I wanted to stop here to share my gratitude to every brave soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman, and National Guardsman who serves in the “Land of the Midnight Sun.” What a beautiful term.
It's what it is, too. It’s great to be standing in this hangar with an F-22 Raptor, the mighty sound of American freedom. That's pretty good stuff, huh. I'll tell you, look at it. Even your fire engine looks pretty good, right.
And then, from $700 billion, we went up to $716 billion. And I won't tell you this year's surprise, but the generals are going to be very happy when they hear because it's going up yet again, because we have no choice. You know, I'm a cost cutter but we have no choice. Without a military, what do we have?
We have to have a great military. And you notice your equipment has been getting better and better, newer and newer? When I got in here, you were having jet fighters that were so old -- you know, you heard the story -- the grandfather flew some of the planes -- some of the bombers. The grandfather, then the son, then the grandchild is here with us now.
And I don't like that. I don't like that. So we've ordered massive numbers of new planes and new everything. It's just an honor to come by the joint base and be with you. I guess we call -- we say ""J-Bear,"" right? J-Bear. In 2017, our wonderful First Lady visited J-Bear and met with the children of deployed service members, and had a fantastic time.
When she hear I was going to be here, she said, ""Say hello."" And she's been a really fantastic First Lady. Our military families are a true national treasure. And without all of the people backing you brave men and women, you know, it wouldn’t work so well for you. Your life would be a lot more difficult.
It wouldn’t be the same. You all know that. Maybe we should give them a round of applause, right? Come on. There are many incredible patriots to recognize here today, beginning with the outstanding Airmen of the 11th Air Force. Give yourselves a hand.
Bob, thank you. Thank you, Bob. Great. Huh? Yes. They're all saying ""yes. Thank you very much. The soldiers from U.S. Army Alaska, and their Commander, Major General Mark O’Neil.
Mark. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Jason. Thank you as well to every warrior -- and that's what you are; you're warriors -- in the Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard.
Finally, I want to thank all of the members of the Alaska National Guard who defend our nation against missile attack, and their Adjutant General, Brigadier General Torrence Saks. Thank you. Thank you, General.
Great job. The men and women who serve at J-Bear share one vital mission: to serve in our country’s “Last Frontier” as America’s first line of defense. Since the Second World War, our intrepid service members in Alaska have proudly stood at the ""top cover for North America.” You are a powerful warning to the world to never strike American soil.
You are a warning that everybody knows about and nobody wants to play with. Here with us today are paratroopers of the Spartan Brigade who wear the maroon beret. Where are they? Where are they. Should I wear one of those things? Huh? It's good when it's windy out, I'll tell you.
It's good. They recently returned from the Brigade’s third deployment to Afghanistan. And they've seen a lot. I've actually spoken to a couple, and I know how they feel. It's going on for 19 years. Made a lot of progress, but 19 years. We just took over -- you know, you kept hearing it was 90 percent, 92 percent -- the caliphate in Syria.
Now it's 100 percent. We just took over. A hundred percent caliphate. That means the area of the land. We just have 100 percent, so that's good. We did that in a much shorter period of time than it was supposed to be. It was supposed to take -- I won't tell you what a certain general told me. But I went and met a couple of other generals, and I said, ""How long do you think it can take, General?"" ""One week, sir."" I said, ""One week?
I heard two years."" ""One week, sir. Let us do it the way we want to do it."" I said, ""General, do it."" And you saw what happened. Right? Everybody saw. We have the whole thing. Among those with us is Sergeant Sean Rogers, who, a few weeks ago, received the Bronze Star for Valor. Where is Sean? Where is Sean?
Sergeant Sean, around here someplace. Where are you, handsome devil. Come up. Should I bring him up? I won't bring the generals. Don't worry about Secret Service. You can take them, Sean.
You want to say something? Come on.
Listen, come on. Maybe he's a natural politician.
Good job, right?
Thank you. While he was in Afghanistan, Sean and his team occupied a rooftop and provided cover for a Special Forces team. Sean rushed into the enemy fire to rescue a member of his team, Specialist Gabriel Condy. Now, I don’t know, is -- let's see, who else is here from that area, from that part, Sean?
Anybody with you? Anybody else? Yeah. Okay. Tragically, Specialist Condy did not make it alive. And, today, we remember the heroic sacrifice of this incredible American hero. We are eternally grateful in his debt. And, Sean, I want to thank you and everybody else involved. But that's really -- really something.
And we pay great respect. You know that. To everyone here today who fights for our flag across the globe: Thank you for bravely facing down the danger to protect -- and have such danger out there -- the lives and liberty of all Americans. Our country is stronger now maybe than it's ever been. Our military is being rebuilt at a rapid pace.
Our economy is powerful. Our economy is probably as good as it's ever been, or better. Unemployment numbers are historic. You've been seeing black unemployment, African American unemployment -- lowest levels in the history of our country. Hispanic unemployment -- lowest levels in the history of our country.
Lowest levels. Best they've ever been. Women -- lowest in 61 years. Sixty-one years. Asian unemployment -- lowest in history, history of our country. And we're just doing great. We're setting records. The stock market is, right now, almost at an all-time high. I have about 18 records. It then went down a little bit because we had to a couple of trade deals, and people didn’t understand.
Now they're starting to say, ""You know, that was pretty good. That’s good what he is doing."" We’re negotiating now with China and others -- Mexico, Canada. We've done those deals. They have to get approved by Congress. We'll see what happens. Dealing with Congress is never easy. I don’t think they like me too much.
. But I will say that you're looking at a country now that's doing better than ever. And there's something -- it has to be -- you're protecting our country. You're protecting us. And I would think it must feel good to know that the country is doing really well, as opposed to really badly, like it has done not so long ago.
So you're protecting something that's very special. All over the world, they're talking about us. I go and I meet the prime ministers and presidents, and kings and queens, and they all say, ""Mr. President, congratulations on your economy -- especially on your economy. We're trying to copy it, and it's not working."" It's just not working for other countries.
Other countries are not doing well. And I want them to do well. But China is way down. The EU is down. A lot of countries are very much down. Most of them. And we're hitting new highs. So we're doing a lot of things right, and you folks are a big reason for it. Also with us today are the amazing people and airmen of the 673rd Air Base Wing.
In the wake of a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, which was just recent, and I remember seeing it. I said, ""Boy, oh, boy. That’s a big one -- 7.0."" Took place in November. They successfully restored airfield operations here at J-Bear in under one hour. That’s pretty quick. Did you -- what did you do to do that?
That's -- well, number one, I gave you good equipment, right? Huh. Thank you for your incredible work. That’s incredible. I heard that you were up and running in about an hour. And it was pretty -- you were hit hard. Alaska hosts the largest combined training area for American air, ground, and maritime forces.
You know the best way to Keep America safe is to keep America strong. And the stronger we get, the less likely it is that we'll have to use that strength. Right, generals? It's an incredible -- it's an incredible -- we learned that in high school, we learned that way before high school. But the stronger you are, the stronger you can be, the less likely it is you'll have to use that strength and that power.
And that’s what we're doing. We're making you so strong. And soon, I can honestly say, strong like we've never been strong before. That's why, in the last two years, I've spent -- when you think about it -- over $1.5 trillion. Next year, the 11th Air Force, headquartered right here at J-Bear, will receive the first of 54 brand-new -- never used before -- F-35 fighter jets.
You like them."" ""We love it, sir."" ""Well, how good is it compared to the enemy aircraft?"" ""Well, sir, you can't see it."" I said, ""Explain that to me."" ""You know, it's stealth."" It's the stealthiest plane, by far, in the world.
So they say, ""Well, when we have battles, you can't see it."" I said, ""Huh, that would be tough."" Wouldn't it be tough if you have somebody and you can't see it? So all I say is this: You get 54 brand new ones. I won't tell you what they cost because it's too much. But they're very special and you're getting very special planes, and you're getting a lot of them -- 54. So they'll be arriving here very soon.
And all of the generals, I hope you're going to give them all to the best pilots, and you're going to take good care of those planes and good care of those pilots. Right? Okay? It's really an honor. But you're getting a big, big number. We'll also deploy 20 more ground-based interceptors to Fort Greeley, which will further strengthen our missile defense system.
So important. Missile defense system is also being rebuilt very substantially. And we're going to have the latest and the greatest. Unfortunately, as soon as you have it, you have to redo it because, after about six months, everything becomes obsolete in this world. Right? We do that, they do this. We do that, they do this.
It's never ending. But that’s the way it goes. It's a cycle. Our goal is very simple: to ensure that we can monitor, detect, and destroy any missile launched against the United States, no matter what speed we're talking about. Any missile. We're spending a tremendous amount of money now on missile technology and also missile defense technology, at my very strong urging.
And what they're able to do now is incredible. It's like shooting a needle in the haystack. It's incredible technology they have. And I said, ""Upgrade it further and further. Advance it."" America does not seek conflict, but if we are forced to defend ourselves, we will fight and we will win in an overwhelming fashion.
That’s where we are. We will forever be grateful for your service and your sacrifice. And we will always ensure that you have the tools, resources, and support you need to defeat our nation’s enemies and safeguard the freedoms given to us by Almighty God. To everyone at J-Bear: We salute you. We thank you for your incredible service.
We love you. God bless you. And God bless the men and women of the armed forces. God bless America. And thank you for doing such a fantastic job. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

William McKinley,United States of America,1897-03-15 00:00:00,"To the Congress of the United States:
Regretting the necessity which has required me to call you together, I feel that your assembling in extraordinary session is indispensable because of the condition in which we find the revenues of the Government. It is conceded that its current expenditures are greater than its receipts, and that such a condition has existed for now more than three years. With unlimited means at our command, we are presenting the remarkable spectacle of increasing our public debt by borrowing money to meet the ordinary outlays incident upon even an economical and prudent administration of the Government. An examination of the subject discloses this fact in every detail and leads inevitably to the conclusion that the condition of the revenue which allows it is unjustifiable and should be corrected.
Since that time the receipts of no fiscal year, and with but few exceptions of no month of any fiscal year, have exceeded the expenditures. The receipts of the Government, from all sources, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, were $372,802,498.29, and its expenditures $442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit, the first since the resumption of specie payments, of $69,803,260.58. Notwithstanding there was a decrease of $16,769,128.78 in the ordinary expenses of the Government, as compared with the previous fiscal year, its income was still not sufficient to provide for its daily necessities, and the gold reserve in the Treasury for the redemption of greenbacks was drawn upon to meet them. But this did not suffice, and the Government then resorted to loans to replenish the reserve.
In February, 1894, $50,000,000 in bonds were issued, and in November following a second issue of $50,000,000 was deemed necessary. The sum of $117,171,795 was realized by the sale of these bonds, but the reserve was steadily decreased until, on February 8, 1895, a third sale of $62,315,400 in bonds, for $65,116,244, was announced to Congress.
The receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, were $390,373,203.30, and the expenditures $433,178,426.48, showing a deficit of $42,805,223.18. A further loan of $100,000,000 was negotiated by the Government in February, 1896, the sale netting $1,166,246, and swelling the aggregate of bonds issued within three years to $262,315,400. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the revenues of the Government from all sources amounted to $409,475,408.78, while its expenditures were $434,678,654.48, or an excess of expenditures over receipts of $25,203,245.70. In other words, the total receipts for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 1896, were insufficient by $137,811,729.46 to meet the total expenditures.
It may be urged that even if the revenues of the Government had been sufficient to meet all its ordinary expenses during the past three years, the gold reserve would still have been insufficient to meet the demands upon it, and that bonds would necessarily have been issued for its repletion. Be this as it may, it is clearly manifest, without denying or affirming the correctness of such a conclusion, that the debt would have been decreased in at least the amount of the deficiency, and business confidence immeasurably strengthened throughout the country.
Congress should promptly correct the existing condition. Ample revenues must be supplied not only for the ordinary expenses of the Government, but for the prompt payment of liberal pensions and the liquidation of the principal and interest of the public debt. In raising revenue, duties should be so levied upon foreign products as to preserve the home market, so far as possible, to our own producers; to revive and increase manufactures; to relieve and encourage agriculture; to increase our domestic and foreign commerce; to aid and develop mining and building; and to render to labor in every field of useful occupation the liberal wages and adequate rewards to which skill and industry are justly entitled. The necessity of the passage of a tariff law which shall provide ample revenue, need not be further urged. The imperative demand of the hour is the prompt enactment of such a measure, and to this object I earnestly recommend that Congress shall make every endeavor. Before other business is transacted, let us first provide sufficient revenue to faithfully administer the Government without the contracting of further debt, or the continued disturbance of our finances.

Donald Trump,United States of America,1997-11-03,"Hello, Matt. This is so impressive with all these thousands out here. It's unbelievable.
I mean, I've never seen anything like this, all the people looking outside.
Believe Forbes, I think they're very accurate. I mean, I really -- I don't know what it is. I have no idea what it is.
I know that I have some great assets and I know that Forbes values them at one thing, and, perhaps I think differently, and that got a lot of press as to which is right, but I -- I will assume that Forbes is right, because once you get over the first million it doesn't matter much.
Much more than that.
Nine hundred and seventy-five was personal guaranteed. That was just the small part. It was just the harder debt. But I owed many, many billions of dollars, and now my company is much bigger and stronger than it was in the '80s, actually. So, it has been talked about. It sort of has been an amazing trip. But I went back to work and I focused and I wrote about it in this book.
Well, they're probably right, but I had so many home runs in a row. I mean, it's like a batter gets up and hits 20 home runs in a row and I started not focusing, Matt, and all of a sudden I had to get back to work. Otherwise, you wouldn't be doing interviews with me, to put it mildly, unless it was on the other side of an interview.
That's right.
I had to renegotiate some of the deals.
And borrow more money, and the borrowing of more money was the best bet I ever made. But by borrowing more money I was able to work it out, keep it going, and then things started changing. And I worked very hard, I focused, I had a great team of people, and I really went back to work. I really focused, and I took a company that was really in trouble, it was really strong in the '80s, and now it's much, much bigger than it was in the '80s, much -- much richer and stronger, so I'm happy about it.
Well, I do. I mean, I believe in an eye for an eye, if you have the chance. I don't think you should necessarily go out of your way, but in one particular case I had a chance to get even with somebody that could have lifted up his hand and made a call, somebody that I really helped a lot, and when it was time to help me that person wasn't there. And now all of a sudden it's sort of come full circle.
Because I don't -- I like being small. I don't mind. I mean, I just -- I just believe in it. If you help somebody and they don't help you, you know, this has created disloyalty, and I don't like disloyal people. I'm a very loyal person.
They have to decide for their own -- you know, for themselves, but I just feel that if somebody goes out of his way to hurt you when you've helped them, it's your turn to get even. So I look forward to the chance.
I like -- I like going against the tide. Oftentimes, being a contrarian, oftentimes that will work. That worked out on Wall Street. I bought buildings on Wall Street when everybody was selling, and now those buildings are very valuable. The Wall Street area has had an unbelievable resurgence. Forty Wall Street is one of the most successful buildings in New York. When I bought it a few years ago everyone said I was crazy. I went against the tide and it turned out to be a -- I mean, just a grand slam home run. So, I like going against the tide. You can't always do that, obviously, but I do like, where appropriate, going against the tide.
I do, and I like assuming that. I don't want to be paranoid to a total sickness, but I like having my guard up. I think having the guard up is a positive thing because people are more vicious than the lions and the tigers that we watch on television every night. I mean, they're the most vicious of all, and it's -- frankly, it's terrible, and it's no way to lead a life, honestly, but you do have to have your guard up at least slightly. Otherwise, you will be hurt.
Right.
I really don't know. I -- I will say this, when I meet people, and know people, like you, I get along great. It's the people that don't know me. I mean, I have a lot of people that really dislike me a lot, but when I know them, when I learn who they are, they learn who I am, I develop a relationship. I have great friendships, and -- I mean, really great friendships. But, hey, overall it seems to be working, so what can I do?
Somehow we'll keep it going, I think, and just -- I hope everyone likes the book. We're so happy with the way that it's selling.
Thank you, Matt.
Well, it was Ivana, and she -- we're great friends now and everything, but I thought she was calling for condolences, 'cause I had just gotten a front-page article in The Times, and The Wall Street Journal saying that there was just no way I could make it back, I was too far in debt, the world was crumbling. And I said, Gee, isn't that nice? Ivana's calling to give me like a little pep talk,' because this was like a low point. And she said, I want my money now.' And it was sort of a famous quote. I guess it's been heard around the world.
And she was talking, and, you know, she had served me numerous times, and had not been successful trying to get much more than the agreement had said. And then all of a sudden when the world was hitting the bottom, she was very happy to get what was in the prenuptial agreement, and she said, I want my money now.' And I was disappointed but we're -- we're very good friends, and we're...
Kids have a lot to do with it. I have great kids. I have three great children with Ivana and one magnificent child, really beautiful child with Marla, and -- and the kids really keep you hanging in there, I think. But Ivana's a very good woman and we have a great relationship, and, you know, we leave it at that.
Well, I'm not in the stock market, I'm in real estate, so...
It would have been -- it would have been bad for me because, I mean, all of a sudden people who want to buy up apartments for $ 9 million are saying, Wait a minute, maybe I shouldn't buy them.'
For the most part I don't have stocks, other than my own company, I have a company stock. I have a public company, which is Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, which is a casino company, which is doing very well, except in the stock market.
The stock price of the gaming companies has been down over the last year or so, and -- and we're a gaming company so our stock prices are down, but the company does great.
Well, I'm a real estate guy, and I've always been a real estate guy, and I've made most of my money in real estate. When you talk about the billions, I mean, I've made out of real estate, I haven't made it in the stock market, I haven't made it in other things. So, I like to invest in real estate. I think real estate's a great investment. It's been a great investment for me, but it's a complex business and you have to know your business.
Oh, at least 50 percent return.
",NBC: Matt Lauer Interviews Donald Trump on The Today Show,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-nbc-matt-lauer-the-today-show-november-3-1997
Franklin D. Roosevelt,United States of America,1936-09-06 00:00:00,"I have been on a journey of husbandry. I went primarily to see at first hand conditions in the drought states; to see how effectively Federal and local authorities are taking care of pressing problems of relief and also how they are to work together to defend the people of this country against the effects of future droughts.
I saw drought devastation in nine states. I talked with families who had lost their wheat crop, lost their corn crop, lost their livestock, lost the water in their well, lost their garden and come through to the end of the summer without one dollar of cash resources, facing a winter without feed or food -- facing a planting season without seed to put in the ground.
That was the extreme case, but there are thousands and thousands of families on western farms who share the same difficulties.
I saw cattlemen who because of lack of grass or lack of winter feed have been compelled to sell all but their breeding stock and will need help to carry even these through the coming winter. I saw livestock kept alive only because water had been brought to them long distances in tank cars. I saw other farm families who have not lost everything but who, because they have made only partial crops, must have some form of help if they are to continue farming next spring.
I shall never forget the fields of wheat so blasted by heat that they cannot be harvested. I shall never forget field after field of corn stunted, earless and stripped of leaves, for what the sun left the grasshoppers took. I saw brown pastures which would not keep a cow on fifty acres.
Yet I would not have you think for a single minute that there is permanent disaster in these drought regions, or that the picture I saw meant depopulating these areas. No cracked earth, no blistering sun, no burning wind, no grasshoppers, are a permanent match for the indomitable American farmers and stockmen and their wives and children who have carried on through desperate days, and inspire us with their self-reliance, their tenacity and their courage. It was their fathers' task to make homes; it is their task to keep those homes; it is our task to help them with their fight.
First let me talk for a minute about this autumn and the coming winter. We have the option, in the case of families who need actual subsistence, of putting them on the dole or putting them to work. They do not want to go on the dole and they are one thousand percent right. We agree, therefore, that we must put them to work for a decent wage, and when we reach that decision we kill two birds with one stone, because these families will earn enough by working, not only to subsist themselves, but to buy food for their stock, and seed for next year's planting. Into this scheme of things there fit of course the government lending agencies which next year, as in the past, will help with production loans.
Every Governor with whom I have talked is in full accord with this program of doing work for these farm families, just as every Governor agrees that the individual states will take care of their unemployables but that the cost of employing those who are entirely able and willing to work must be borne by the Federal Government.
If then we know, as we do today, the approximate number of farm families who will require some form of work relief from now on through the winter, we face the question of what kind of work they should do. Let me make it clear that this is not a new question because it has already been answered to a greater or less extent in every one of the drought communities. Beginning in 1934, when we also had serious drought conditions, the state and Federal governments cooperated in planning a large number of projects -- many of them directly aimed at the alleviation of future drought conditions. In accordance with that program literally thousands of ponds or small reservoirs have been built in order to supply water for stock and to lift the level of the underground water to protect wells from going dry. Thousands of wells have been drilled or deepened; community lakes have been created and irrigation projects are being pushed.
Water conservation by means such as these is being expanded as a result of this new drought all through the Great Plains area, the western corn belt and in the states that lie further south. In the Middle West water conservation is not so pressing a problem. Here the work projects run more to soil erosion control and the building of farm-to-market roads.
Spending like this is not waste. It would spell future waste if we did not spend for such things now. These emergency work projects provide money to buy food and clothing for the winter; they keep the livestock on the farm; they provide seed for a new crop, and, best of all, they will conserve soil and water in the future in those areas most frequently hit by drought.
If, for example, in some local area the water table continues to drop and the topsoil to blow away, the land values will disappear with the water and the soil. People on the farms will drift into the nearby cities; the cities will have no farm trade and the workers in the city factories and stores will have no jobs. Property values in the cities will decline. If, on the other hand, the farms within that area remain as farms with better water supply and no erosion, the farm population will stay on the land and prosper and the nearby cities will prosper too. Property values will increase instead of disappearing. That is why it is worth our while as a nation to spend money in order to save money.
I have, however, used the argument in relation only to a small area -- it holds good in its effect on the nation as a whole. Every state in the drought area is now doing and always will do business with every state outside it. The very existence of the men and women working in the clothing factories of New York, making clothes worn by farmers and their families; of the workers in the steel mills in Pittsburgh, in the automobile factories of Detroit, and in the harvester factories of Illinois, depend upon the farmers' ability to purchase the commodities they produce. In the same way it is the purchasing power of the workers in these factories in the cities that enables them and their wives and children to eat more beef, more pork, more wheat, more corn, more fruit and more dairy products, and to buy more clothing made from cotton, wool and leather. In a physical and a property sense, as well as in a spiritual sense, we are members one of another.
I want to make it clear that no simple panacea can be applied to the drought problem in the whole of the drought area. Plans must depend on local conditions, for these vary with annual rainfall, soil characteristics, altitude and topography. Water and soil conservation methods may differ in one county from those in an adjoining county. Work to be done in the cattle and sheep country differs in type from work in the wheat country or work in the corn belt.
The Great Plains Drought Area Committee has given me its preliminary recommendations for a long-time program for that region. Using that report as a basis we are cooperating successfully and in entire accord with the Governors and state planning boards. As we get this program into operation the people more and more will be able to maintain themselves securely on the land. That will mean a steady decline in the relief burdens which the Federal Government and states have had to assume in time of drought; but, more important, it will mean a greater contribution to general national prosperity by these regions which have been hit by drought. It will conserve and improve not only property values, but human values. The people in the drought area do not want to be dependent on Federal, state or any other kind of charity. They want for themselves and their families an opportunity to share fairly by their own efforts in the progress of America.
The farmers of America want a sound national agricultural policy in which a permanent land use program will have an important place. They want assurance against another year like 1932 when they made good crops but had to sell them for prices that meant ruin just as surely as did the drought. Sound policy must maintain farm prices in good crop years as well as in bad crop years. It must function when we have drought; it must also function when we have bumper crops.
The maintenance of a fair equilibrium between farm prices and the prices of industrial products is an aim which we must keep ever before us, just as we must give constant thought to the sufficiency of the food supply of the nation even in bad years. Our modern civilization can and should devise a more successful means by which the excess supplies of bumper years can be conserved for use in lean years.
On my trip I have been deeply impressed with the general efficiency of those agencies of the Federal, state and local governments which have moved in on the immediate task created by the drought. In 1934 none of us had preparation; we worked without blueprints and made the mistakes of inexperience. Hindsight shows us this. But as time has gone on we have been making fewer and fewer mistakes. Remember that the Federal and state governments have done only broad planning. Actual work on a given project originates in the local community. Local needs are listed from local information. Local projects are decided on only after obtaining the recommendations and help of those in the local community who are best able to give it. And it is worthy of note that on my entire trip, though I asked the question dozens of times, I heard no complaint against the character of a single works relief project.
The elected heads of the states concerned, together with their state officials and their experts from agricultural colleges and state planning boards, have shown cooperation with and approval of the work which the Federal Government has headed up. I am grateful also to the men and women in all these states who have accepted leadership in the work in their locality.
In the drought area people are not afraid to use new methods to meet changes in Nature, and to correct mistakes of the past. If overgrazing has injured range lands, they are willing to reduce the grazing. If certain wheat lands should be returned to pasture they are willing to cooperate. If trees should be planted as windbreaks or to stop erosion they will work with us. If terracing or summer fallowing or crop rotation is called for, they will carry them out. They stand ready to fit, and not to fight, the ways of Nature.
We are helping, and shall continue to help the farmer to do those things, through local soil conservation committees and other cooperative local, state and federal agencies of government.
I have not the time tonight to deal with other and more comprehensive agricultural policies.
With this fine help we are tiding over the present emergency. We are going to conserve soil, conserve water and conserve life. We are going to have long-time defenses against both low prices and drought. We are going to have a farm policy that will serve the national welfare. That is our hope for the future.
There are two reasons why I want to end by talking about reemployment. Tomorrow is Labor Day. The brave spirit with which so many millions of working people are winning their way out of depression deserves respect and admiration. It is like the courage of the farmers in the drought areas.
That is my first reason. The second is that healthy employment conditions stand equally with healthy agricultural conditions as a buttress of national prosperity. Dependable employment at fair wages is just as important to the people in the towns and cities as good farm income is to agriculture. Our people must have the ability to buy the goods they manufacture and the crops they produce. Thus city wages and farm buying power are the two strong legs that carry the nation forward.
Re-employment in industry is proceeding rapidly. Government spending was in large part responsible for keeping industry going and putting it in a position to make this reemployment possible. Government orders were the backlog of heavy industry government wages turned over and over again to make consumer purchasing power and to sustain every merchant in the community. Businessmen with their businesses, small and large, had to be saved. Private enterprise is necessary to any nation which seeks to maintain the democratic form of government. In their case, just as certainly as in the case of drought-stricken farmers, government spending has saved.
Government having spent wisely to save it, private industry begins to take workers off the rolls of the government relief program. Until this Administration we had no free employment service, except in a few states and cities. Because there was no unified employment service, the worker, forced to move as industry moved, often travelled over the country, wandering after jobs which seemed always to travel just a little faster than he did. He was often victimized by fraudulent practices of employment clearing houses, and the facts of employment opportunities were at the disposal neither of himself nor of the employer.
In 1933 the United States Employment Service was created -- a cooperative state and Federal enterprise, through which the Federal Government matches dollar for dollar the funds provided by the states for registering the occupations and skills of workers and for actually finding jobs for these registered workers in private industry. The Federal-State cooperation has been splendid. Already employment services are operating in 32 states, and the areas not covered by them are served by the Federal Government.
We have developed a nationwide service with seven hundred District offices, and one thousand branch offices, thus providing facilities through which labor can learn of jobs available and employers can find workers.
Last Spring I expressed the hope that employers would realize their deep responsibility to take men off the relief rolls and give them jobs in private enterprise. Subsequently I was told by many employers that they were not satisfied with the information available concerning the skill and experience of the workers on the relief rolls. On August 25th I allocated a relatively small sum to the employment service for the purpose of getting better and more recent information in regard to those now actively at work on WPA Projects -- information as to their skills and previous occupations -- and to keep the records of such men and women up-to-date for maximum service in making them available to industry. Tonight I am announcing the allocation of two and a half million dollars more to enable the Employment Service to make an even more intensive search then it has yet been equipped to make, to find opportunities in private employment for workers registered with it.
Tonight I urge the workers to cooperate with and take full advantage of this intensification of the work of the Employment Service. This does not mean that there will be any lessening of our efforts under our WPA and PWA and other work relief programs until all workers have decent jobs in private employment at decent wages. We do not surrender our responsibility to the unemployed. We have had ample proof that it is the will of the American people that those who represent them in national, state and local government should continue as long as necessary to discharge that responsibility. But it does mean that the government wants to use resource to get private work for those now employed on government work, and thus to curtail to a minimum the government expenditures for direct employment.
Tonight I ask employers, large and small, throughout the nation, to use the help of the state and Federal Employment Service whenever in the general pick-up of business they require more workers.
Tomorrow is Labor Day. Labor Day in this country has never been a class holiday. It has always been a national holiday. It has never had more significance as a national holiday than it has now. In other countries the relationship of employer and employee has more or less been accepted as a class relationship not readily to be broken through. In this country we insist, as an essential of the American way of life, that the employer-employee relationship should be one between free men and equals. We refuse to regard those who work with hand or brain as different from or inferior to those who live from their property. We insist that labor is entitled to as much respect as property. But our workers with hand and brain deserve more than respect for their labor. They deserve practical protection in the opportunity to use their labor at a return adequate to support them at a decent and constantly rising standard of living, and to accumulate a margin of security against the inevitable vicissitudes of life.
The average man must have that twofold opportunity if we are to avoid the growth of a class conscious society in this country.
There are those who fail to read both the signs of the times and American history. They would try to refuse the worker any effective power to bargain collectively, to earn a decent livelihood and to acquire security. It is those short-sighted ones, not labor, who threaten this country with that class dissension which in other countries has led to dictatorship and the establishment of fear and hatred as the dominant emotions in human life.
All American workers, brain workers and manual workers alike, and all the rest of us whose well-being depends on theirs, know that our needs are one in building an orderly economic democracy in which all can profit and in which all can be secure from the kind of faulty economic direction which brought us to the brink of common ruin seven years ago.
There is no cleavage between white collar workers and manual workers, between artists and artisans, musicians and mechanics, lawyers and accountants and architects and miners.
Tomorrow, Labor Day, belongs to all of us. Tomorrow, Labor Day, symbolizes the hope of all Americans. Anyone who calls it a class holiday challenges the whole concept of American democracy.
The Fourth of July commemorates our political freedom -- a freedom which without economic freedom is meaningless indeed. Labor Day symbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the average man which will give his political freedom reality.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-08-14,"Thank you very much. What a nice group of people. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to treat you right. They’re not. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to change that around quickly.
Pat, I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time. I’ve known you for a long time. You do one hell of a job, and you’re pretty popular with these people I see. Thank you, Pat. Well, maybe I’ll say a few words. It’s appropriate in light of everything that’s going on. They won’t let you do your job, that’s all it is.
So it’s my great honor to proudly accept something that Pat’s going to give me in a little while, so I’ll hold off on the word endorsement, but he’s going to give me an endorsement, I understand. And I have deeply and profoundly admired the brave men and women, as you know, of New York City’s finest, and I’ve admired you my whole life. My whole life I’ve watched you do a job like nobody else. Nobody else has done it. And truly, you’re the best of the best and I’m grateful. And I’m very happy that you’re here, and we’ll have a little fun for a little while, but first we’re going to talk a little business. We have to talk business because we have to straighten out our city. Our city’s a mess.
Every day, the courageous offices of NYPD put your lives on the line to protect the innocent and to put violent criminals behind bars. You protect people you’ve never met before. You know, I’ve heard that expression a long time ago, and it always means something to me. You’re protecting people with your lives, people that you’ve never met before, and you’ve done an incredible job.
And the world will never forget the New York police offices who ran into the smoke and flames of 9/11, I was there, many never to return. We salute the heroes of NYPD and we salute our law enforcement heroes all across the nation. I was responsible, along with a couple of people that were right in this audience, for getting you some very good and large payments so that we can take care of some of the people that were hurt so badly. Longterm hurt they call it, right? Longterm hurt, but we got it done and we got it signed. We got it signed and we’re taking of a lot of people.
And we want to thank our great firefighters also, right alongside of you, right? Our great firefighters.
As we gather today, our country is suffering from a radical far left movement. It’s not even to be believed when you see this, what they’re thinking. Where did these people come from? Where do they come from? That is trying to defame, demoralize, defund, dismantle, and dissolve our great police departments. It’s a left wing war on cops.
If Sleepy Joe Biden were to become precedent, he would immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America. You know that. And probably, she’s a step worse. She’s a step worse, Kamala. She of Indian heritage number. Remember I said I have more Indian than her, I have more Indian than she does? And I went into it. I went into it at great length and I turned out to be right. I have none and I had more than she had. She’s another beauty.
Portland and Chicago are the left’s roadmap to America, and sadly, what’s happened over the last year in New York City. And it’s an incredible thing to look at, an incredible, incredible thing. And I just saw somebody here named Rudy Giuliani. Do you know Rudy Giuliani? Where’s Rudy? Is he around here? Get up here, Rudy. Get up. What are you doing down there, Mr. Mayor? This the greatest Mayor our city has ever had. Rudy, come on up here. Come on up. What a great… And he’s a man who is loyal and dedicated and tough. He got on television to defend me. He said things that even I wouldn’t say. He was brutal. He is incredible. He knew. He got it.
Joe Biden’s national police strategy will be modeled on the Bill DeBlasio, catastrophe. It’s a catastrophe. No one will be safe in Biden’s American, no city, no town, no suburb will be spared. And you see how I did something to help the suburbs of our country last week? A lot of people don’t want to even talk about it, but we did something that nobody else would have done. They’re ruining your suburbs. They want to ruin it. They want to destroy their housing values and your safety. But we ended it. We ended the program entirely. Somebody said, “Let’s amend it.” I said, “No, let’s end it.”
The Biden-Harris agenda, and I guess Harris could be bigger than you think in terms of the importances of vice president. They said there’s never been a more important pick, but in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re going to win. You know, honestly, we don’t have a choice. We have to win. This country will go to hell. The stock markets will crash. Your 401ks are going to be worthless. You’ll see. You’ll see what would happen, crime all over the place.
I mean, you take a look at Portland. You take a look at Chicago, and I can name plenty of other cities, but I don’t want to embarrass anybody. My agenda is anti-crime and pro-cop all the way and that’s what it’s got to be.
So in recent months, New York City has witnessed the horrors that result from putting extreme left politicians into power. DeBlasio has launched a crusade against, and he really has, he has launched a real crusade against the police like I don’t think anybody’s ever really seen, but there are cases that are just as bad. There are some cases, radical left, that may be even are worse.
The mobs have scrawled disgusting slogans such as cops must die. Think of this, cops must die and kill all cops. Okay? Who would even have thought 10 years ago that was possible? On the side of buildings, they put those terms. And they vandalized St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, with horrible, horrible statements, horrible phrases. And then of course that disgusting chant, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” right? Remember that?
And now, all of a sudden, it becomes mainstream. It becomes, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful?” They were talking about you. You know that, right? We just can’t forget it because we have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country, and we’re doing it. Wherever we go, we do it. But when you have the radical left running it, no good.
Rioters have rampaged through Manhattan and looted Fifth Avenue and an NYPD Sargent was left, as you know very well, in critical condition after being rundown with a car. A Molotov cocktail was thrown into a police vehicle in Brooklyn. And NYPD’s highest ranking uniform chief and other offices were beaten in broad daylight on the Brooklyn Bridge. And they’re not allowed to fight back. You’re not allowed to fight back. You fight back, you lose your pension, you lose your life. They put you in jail you fight back. No, you got to be able to fight back.
I mean, to me, one of the saddest, and I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but one of the saddest things, Rudy, that I’ve ever seen, Pat, was when they were dumping water on the heads of two of your fellow officers. And I wish they fought back. I promise nothing would have happened to them. Because who even knew that was water? It could have been plenty of other things. It probably was actually. But it could have been some very dangerous material, not water. And they didn’t fight back. The first time I’ve ever seen that. I wish they did. I wish they did. I wish I could have talked to them. I said, “Fight back. I swear you’ll be protected.”
This is the left’s vision for the future of the United States of America. If they win this election, November 3rd, got to get out, got to get everybody you know. You know, the Democrats have an advantage because they have certain people that automatically vote. And we’re going from New York. Because we did well last time. You know, New York is not supposed to be Republican territory. It was Ronald Reagan. But a lot of the people left. A lot of the people that voted for Ronald Reagan left. That was the last time. And they voted for Ronald Reagan, but they left. They went on to other places. They got tired of being abused and high taxes and all of the other problems.
And we’re going to go and run and we’re going to run on law and order, and we’re going to run our lower taxes, and we’re going to run on doing something with salt. You know what the salt is? Remember Schumer? Schumer said, “I try and bring home things to my people in New York.” You know what he brought home? Salt. For those of you that don’t know, look it up. It’s not good.
But if they win this election, every city in America will be under siege. You know that. Because the police are good in Seattle and they’re good in all of these different places I talked about. They’re not being let do their job. Can’t do their job.
Their pro-crime agenda, the Biden-Harris group will also crush our economy because there is no prosperity in cities that are ruled by fear. And I even think the politicians are afraid. If you look at Portland, the Mayor is trying to say, “Oh, these are my friends.” And then he goes in there, they want to beat the hell out of him. And then the fake news doesn’t report that. They’ll show him standing there with the sound down so you don’t hear what they’re saying to the Mayor. Fortunately, he had five body guards when he went in, right? But it was very dangerous for him. And I don’t know if he’s doing this at a stupidity or out of fear. Because I think they’re afraid actually.
Yeah. It sounds like one my friends.
My administration has made clear that the Department of Justice will partner arm-in-arm with our police heroes. And we’re with you all the way and we’ll prosecute all federal violations to the fullest extent of the law. But you know, we have to be invited in, unless we do something very drastic, which is a big statement, but we have to be invited in. But you don’t need help. You guys don’t need help. You have the greatest police force in the world. You have the greatest in the world. All they have to do is tell your top people to do your job and you’re going to do it properly. It’s going to go down like it did with Rudy Giuliani. It’s going to go down so fast.
That happened quickly, Rudy. That didn’t take too long.
That didn’t take too long. You, he looks good enough. Let’s draft Rudy. You better be careful, he’d win it. He’d win very easily. Because people want that back. They want it back. That’s why I think, I really am, I’m putting it into play. Most people would say, “Oh, spend your time in other places,” but I’m going to put it. We did very well. We did incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various, Staten Island was-
Incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various … Staten Island was great, right? Staten Island was great. By the way, Joe Rose is a disaster. I will tell you that. I hope they get him out of there. He’s a total lightweight in many ways. Joe Rose, get him out.
He turns out he’s another beauty. My administration will so increase funding for police so that we can hire more police offices nationwide. We’re increasing funding very substantially. And in many cases, they don’t want it. They want to put into a different group. I said, “What’s that group all about?” And it’s called socialism, and it doesn’t work. Never will work.
By contrast, New York City voted to defund the police by $1 billion, if you can believe it, even after experiencing the bloodiest June in nearly 25 years. It’s dismantled an elite team of crime fighters, that crime fighting unit that your friends, there were incredible people. They were making us all safe. Nationwide, they were making us safe and we got to get them back. We got to bring them back. Hopefully, they don’t get a job for too much money. Tell them not to look too hard because we’re going to bring them back. We’ll get them back. They’re the best. They’re the best. Joe Biden and Kamala, they always say Kamala, Kamala, Harris have a plan to spread this mayhem to every community in America.
Now, in all fairness to Joe, he doesn’t really know what’s happening. They say, “Joe, we’re going to spread it around. Oh, okay. Okay.” This guy doesn’t answer any questions. He gets up today. He made a statement. I just did an incredible deal with UAE. You saw that, right? Everyone’s shocked. Even the New York Times said it was incredible deal. Can you believe? The New York Times? I can’t even believe it. Thomas Friedman, they wrote an incredible editorial. It was a great deal. So we did this deal. Nobody else did it. In fact, we were at a huge deficit because of the horrible deal that Obama made with Iran. Gave them $150 billion, billion, not million. 150 million’s a lot. That would be too much also. 150 billion then gave them 1.8 billion in cash. I broke the deal. I terminated the deal, but we made a deal, UAE and Israel. And sleepy Joe got up and said he made the deal. I said, “Whoa.” Did anybody hear that? He actually took credit for making that deal.
For a change, I’m being praised all over the world for making that deal, and that’s just the beginning. I think they just said, “Say this Joe. Say that you made it.” It’s like it was Obama’s economy right? Before the plague, we had the greatest economy in history. Greatest economy anywhere in the world, let alone ours. And now we’re building it back up very rapidly. You see the numbers. But they were taking credit. They said, “Oh, this was Obama. Obama.” He said manufacturing would never come back. That was Obama. Manufacturing has come back big. In fact, even two days ago, they announced incredible numbers. When asked recently if he favors cutting police budget, Biden replied. “Yes, absolutely.” But I’m not sure honestly he knew what he was replying to so we’re not … “Yes, absolutely. What did I say? What was I referring to?” You could use that clip for a million different things right? Yes, absolutely. You never say that as a politician. You always finish out.
Biden has been described by police as and he described the police, you saw that, as the enemy. He said it’s the enemy. Kamala Harris applauded LA’s recent decision to slash its police budget, and LA really went to town on it, you saw that. Millions and millions of dollars off their budget. After the riots in Minneapolis, Kamala encouraged Americans to donate money to the so-called Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out rapists, assaulters and murderers. They bailed them right out of jail. Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. We can’t lose this election. Okay?
We can’t loose.
We’re building a big wall. We’re building the wall. It’s up to almost … Look at her. She’s all excited about that. That’s-
Yeah, we’re building. It’s up to 280 miles. Will be up … That’ll be completed-
You’re right. I like her. No, you’re right. And you know who like the wall? The Southern border, you know who like at the most? Hispanics, because they know the area. They know what comes in and they want to be safe. They want to keep their good jobs. They want to keep their beautiful houses. They’ve done well, but they know the area the best. We’re doing great with the Hispanics. As San Francisco district attorney, she chose not to seek the death penalty against a gang member who killed a San Francisco police officer going against the wishes of the officer’s wife, going against the wishes of the police. In his unity manifesto written with socialist … Bernie Sanders is another beauty, Bernie. Crazy Bernie. We’ve got names for all of them no? What’s better? Sleepy Joe or slow Joe? Tell me.
What is better?
I go back and forth.
I go back and-
Okay, let’s do it. Who likes Slow Joe?
Who likes Sleepy Joe?
That’s what I thought. I got all these guys telling me, “Oh, you ought to do. We don’t like sleepy because it’s rude.” They said it’s rude. I said, “We’re talking about the president of the United States.” I can tell you one thing. Putin and Kim Jong Un and President Xi of China, they’re not sleepy. We’re never going to say sleepy or slow, and we can’t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them either because we were doing very well against all of them. All of them. And we’re have a good relationship now. Remember North Korea? We were going to go to war with North Korea. Obama would have been in a war. Millions of people could have been killed in that war. Where’s the war? Everybody said, “Trump will be in war in the first week.” Where’s the war? In fact, we’re bringing people out of the endless Wars. The Wars that where their doing your job. They’re policemen and that’s great, but they want to fight. They want to win. We didn’t let people win. Bring them back. We shouldn’t have been there in the first place. So we bring them back, and what we’re doing is bringing them back with great dignity.
It’s incredible what’s happened. We’ve totally rebuilt our armed forces, $2.5 trillion. We’ve given you hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Pat, you know that. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment came out of … It was collecting dust, right? It was army surplus stuff and all the different … It was beautiful stuff and Obama didn’t want you to have it. They said it made you look too strong, too tough. You look too military. So they said, “Let them get shot.” Much of it was protective equipment. You know that. I released it all. I gave it to all the police departments all across the country and I have had more thank yous for that. And someday, they’re going to have to explain why they didn’t want to do it. And this was sitting there. It was not going to be used. A lot of it was new, but it wasn’t going to be used. And I said, “Give it to our great police all over the country.” And we did and it’s been great.
And just to finish up, I call it the manifesto because Bernie Sanders, he was going to make an agreement and they were going to go a little bit further right. They didn’t. They went further left than Bernie was. So in the manifesto, Biden pledges to abolish cash bail. How about that? No cash bail. No bail, meaning that violent and dangerous criminals would simply be released after arrest. New York tried this insane policy and crime surged nearly 25% in New York City and now it’s up much, much higher than that. This is an old statistic. It’s up much higher than that. So nationwide, the Biden plan to abolish bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets.
So all I’m saying is this. We have the greatest police departments. We have great police. We have great forces. They have to be allowed to do their job. And I’ve seen Pat and I’ve seen you. You’re going to have a bad apple. You’re going to have somebody who makes a horrible mistake. You’re going to have somebody has a bad moment, but it may be just a bad apple. We’ve seen it. But that doesn’t mean we’re going to close up our police departments. And like in Minneapolis, tell them to run. Leave, leave. Did you ever see anything like that? Where they left? Where they left? We can’t ever let that happen. We sent in the National Guard five or six days later. We waited, we waited, we waited. Within one hour, the whole thing was … You never heard of anything. On these monuments and statues, you saw that? They were trying to rip them down. They ripped some down. I immediately signed an order that if you get caught ripping down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in jail. 10 years.
And I don’t know about you, I haven’t seen too many statues being ripped down lately. They were going to have a march on Washington, Washington. They wanted to rip down statues. I said, “So wait a minute. You’re going to rip down statues, you’re going to go to jail for 10 years.” I signed it publicly. Very public. You got to let them know or otherwise, it’s not fair. They get 10 years, they didn’t know about it right? Wise guys. So we let them know you get 10 years in jail. I took an old law because they don’t do those laws today. Today, get that through the house. Tell Nancy Pelosi we’re going to give somebody 10 years. She’s terrible. Look at what’s happened to San Francisco. Look at the tents. Look at the homeless. That’s Nancy. She ought to go home and clean up her own city, but take a look.
But it’s 10 years in jail. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They were going to come down and knock down. They had them earmarked. And as soon as they announced that, nobody showed up. It was amazing. Big march, nobody showed up. They said, “No, we’re going to do it the following …” That was a Thursday night. “We’re going to do it the next night, Friday.” Nobody showed up except four people. They all got arrested because they were the four people that the media had on top of the statue of Andrew Jackson doing damage. Almost got it down. And I’ll say something. The Washington, the D.C. police were great because they had the ropes. You saw the ropes. They were ready to pull it down. They were all set and our guys said, “Stop it.” And those guys ran in and that thing was over. Those Washington, those D.C. police did a job. That wasn’t like you know. They did a job. So we’re going to give you back your stature. We’re going to give you back your status. I hate to say it, but it’s been taken away. We’re going to give you back the right to be New York’s finest, the finest of all time, the greatest of all time, and we’re going to win on November 3rd. And the people that didn’t love Trump, never Trumpers, a lot of them are saying, “I’m starting to like Trump a lot,” because they see what’s happening. And we’re going to give New York a real shot and I think we have one hell of a shot at doing it. I just said this morning, the New York Post, which has been great. The New York post had a cover story about that. They came and interviewed me at the Oval Office and they talked about law and order in the city. And I said, “I did very well, Republican wise. I did very well.” We did great, and I really believe that that solid core of people has to be real. First of all, they’re leaving. A lot of them are leaving, but they have to be discuss-
I mean first of all they are leaving a lot of them are leaving, but they have to be disgusted with what’s going on. So I said then and there and I said it today. I put it out today strongly, we’re going to go and give New York a real shot. I think we have a real chance of winning New York, but we’re going to give you so much of what you’re looking for. Because I know exactly it’s so easy you need leadership, you need money, you can’t defund. It has to go the other way. You need equipment.
But what do you need more than anything else is your dignity and respect. You need respect, you need your dignity back and this guy has taken your dignity away and your respect away. And I am telling you on November 3rd you’re going to be getting it back like you haven’t gotten it back before. Because this is really a referendum. So I want to thank you very much. And Pat, thank you very much. Fellas thank you.
How does the oval office for that sound? Okay? Good?
Well, I just want to thank you that was incredible. I assumed it was given out because I see a lot of things given out and they shouldn’t be given out. But a special man, you are just really special people. You really are. You’re very brave people. I will say this, you read a lot of negatives. They have a lot of fake media, fake news, false news, call it whatever you want, corrupt news. But you have no idea how much the people of this country love our police departments, our police, our law enforcement, our border patrols, our ICE people. ICE they go into the toughest situations. They take out MS13 by the thousands and then they get abused. But they’re not really abused, they’re loved by the people of this country. And New York’s great police force is something that I grew up with.
I used to go with my father in Brooklyn to a little, I shouldn’t tell you this, a little hamburger place for lunch. And we’d see these big cops come in and they were great. And everybody stood at attention when they walked in and we’re going to get that back. You’re respected just the same, but they don’t allow it to happen. We’re going to allow it to happen. You are great, great people. And remember this, you are loved by our country, loved by our country and respected by our country.
And all we have to do is let you do your job, right? Just let you do your job. Pat, I think it might be appropriate. So we really do. We have New York city’s greatest mayor of all time. He took over a city that I don’t know, was worse. Maybe better. I don’t know what I’m going to ask Rudy what’s the difference between that city and the city of today? Certainly it caught up very quickly for a long while it was a lot better, but when Rudy ran it, it was incredible. The crime statistics, the murder. I hate to use that word, murder. I don’t know if this place has ever heard that word murder. It’s not into the word of murder.
But when you look at the stats, I looked at them the other day it was incredible what he was able to do in a short period of time with only New York’s finest. Without New York’s finest he couldn’t have done it. He let them do the job and he had three very great commissioners. He keeps telling me three great commissioners. I always say, “Who is the best?” He doesn’t want to tell me maybe he’ll tell you. But I’ve asked him many times, “Who is the best Rudy I want to know who? Who is the best?” He’ll never tell me, but there’s always the best, right? There’s always somebody. But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words.
But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words and we love you all. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Does anyone else want to speak. Does anyone else want to … So again, it’s an honor that you came. I just want to pay my respects to a really good guy that I love. It’s my brother, he’s very ill and he would not have … I mean, he just said, “Don’t even think about it.” I really appreciate what he said. He’s having a very tough time, but I really appreciate being with you today. He respected you as much as I do. He respected you, like everybody. We all respect you and we’re going to let you do your job. We’re going to let you do your job. That’s all we have to do. Again, thank you very much. It’s such an honor to be with you, to get the endorsement pad of this group of incredible men and women is mind-blowing. Really it is.
Mind blowing and just, I’m going to leave you with this very simple phrase. I will never, ever let you down. I will never let you down. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
",Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york
Clive Lewis,United Kingdom,2016-07-18,"My hon. One can tell how good a debate has been when Members find themselves nodding vigorously, no matter from which side of the House the points are being made. I think that that has happened quite a lot over the past two days.
I am honoured to be closing this debate on behalf of the Opposition. The Chilcot report is an extraordinary piece of work and I hope the whole House will join me in congratulating Sir John Chilcot on his efforts. He took a fair amount of flak during the lengthy writing of it, but it seems clear that it has been worth the wait. The report is in the very highest and noblest traditions of our country. It has unflinchingly shone a light both on crucial decisions made by our leaders and on how those decisions were made. It has not ducked from shining that light at the very highest levels of our Government—indeed, at the very top.
It would be naive to suppose that complete openness is always possible in government, especially over matters as grave as going to war. None the less, openness will always ensure that our policies have a firm moral foundation. As a great American jurist once said,
“If the broad light of day could be let in upon men’s actions, if would purify them as the sun disinfects”.
The report has let sunlight in on much that some would prefer to remain hidden. It is the most comprehensive and devastating critique we have had of the individual, collective and systemic errors that added up to the failure in Iraq—a failure whose consequences we are still dealing with and will have to deal with for many years to come.
I wish to pay tribute to comments by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Over two days, we have heard contributions from, among others, my hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell), who emphasised the need for war to be seen always as a measure of last resort, and from the right hon. Friend the Member for Derby South (Margaret Beckett), who has served as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and therefore speaks with considerable authority on these issues.
Many Members, including the hon. and gallant Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Johnny Mercer) in what I thought was one of the finest speeches of the debate. The hon. Friend the Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn) were among the many contributors yesterday who spoke about the lack of adequate planning for the post-war reconstruction phase. As the right hon.
The hon. The knowledgeable and right hon. The hon.
The speech that I felt best captured my personal anxieties was that of the hon. He spoke of the need for a more holistic approach to defence in both soft and hard power, and warned us that the continual budget cuts to the FCO undermine our ability not just to respond to global security threats, but to pre-empt them.
I want to focus on two topics that stand out to me: civilian casualties and equipment failures. Sir John estimates that there were at least 150,000 Iraqi fatalities, but suggests that the number is probably much higher. He notes that a proper assessment of the likely number of civilian casualties was not made before the invasion and that there was no systematic recording of casualties after the war had started. In one of his most scathing remarks, his report concludes:
“More time was devoted to the question of which department should have responsibility for the issue of civilian casualties than it was to efforts to determine the actual number.”
Today, it seems that Whitehall has yet to learn from this mistake. In the air campaign against Daesh, the Government insist that not a single civilian has been lost in almost two years of UK airstrikes. This seems literally incredible. Ministers give cryptic answers to questions about how they assess the damage caused by airstrikes, how they distinguish between combatants and civilians, and what they mean when they say they will consider all credible reports of civilian loss of life. The Government’s continued lack of transparency on this issue is troubling. I urge the Secretary of State, in the light of the report, to look again at how his Department monitors and collates information on civilian casualties.
The exposure of equipment failures is one of the gravest findings in the report. Chilcot sheds new light on this by documenting the sheer scale of the problem. Shortages of helicopters and armoured vehicles had terrible consequences. Day after day we saw Snatch Land Rovers that were designed for riot duty in Northern Ireland blown to bits by huge roadside bombs. There were also shortages of uniforms, boots and even such basic necessities as toilet paper. Some units even had to borrow rations from the Americans; one unit became known as “the Borrowers”. Some of the soldiers who died in Iraq were still teenagers, and it is a disgrace that they were sent there so woefully prepared. Although we understand that it is literally impossible to plan for every equipment need and contingency, we can never again let such catastrophic failure occur.
I want to pay a personal tribute to the families of our troops who died for their dogged and persistent pursuit of the truth about these equipment failures. Their steadfastness to the cause was heroic. I and everyone who saw some active service in the years that followed owe them a deep debt of gratitude. We got the kit their sons and daughters did not get. I, for one, will never forget the commitment to this cause that they showed. It undoubtedly saved many lives, and I hope that that knowledge can bring them some small consolation.
I have spoken about some of the specific failings identified in the report, but I must also speak of the much wider failings that a report of this scale and quality makes clear, such as the failure of this House sufficiently to hold the Executive to account on matters as grave as taking this country to war. Chilcot tells us that we must never allow a rush to war to blind us to facts or their absence. We must never allow a debate to be closed down with snide imputations of a lack of patriotism, or by the kind of macho posturing that suggests that those who urge caution, who demand evidence and who want proof when allegations of the gravest seriousness are made are somehow cowardly or undeserving of a voice.
The guardianship of this country’s future and the future safety of the world are issues that require not the posturing bravado of adolescence, but mature wisdom and a readiness to accept that every voice in this Chamber is worthy of our fullest respect, because those voices have been sent here as representatives of the British people, in all their variety and complexity, and we all speak for Britain here. If we speak again of a rush to bomb the odious Government of President Assad, we should not be derided as supporters of the Assad regime. When, just two years later, we are told that we must now bomb President Assad’s enemies in Daesh and we ask the question, “How will this bombing achieve our aims?”, we must not be told that we are soft on terrorism. We are demanding evidence of a coherent long-term plan that is backed with credible evidence and sufficient resources to achieve a lasting peace, founded on justice.
I am not a pacifist. My grandfather, of whose armed service I am deeply proud, was a paratrooper in the Normandy landings, and I have already mentioned my own service. I will always demand, however, the highest standard of proof for taking our country to war, and I will never apologise for that. These are literally matters of life and death, and the British people deserve better than political posturing.
Ultimately, if we cannot face and accept the consequences of our actions, we cannot learn the lessons and we cannot make wiser choices in the future. I hope that when we discuss issues of the gravest possible importance next week—those relating to Britain’s nuclear capability—this House will do so in a spirit of due humility and awareness of our shortcomings. We are not infallible, and when we are making choices of such gravity, we must speak with the very best part of ourselves and not stoop to political point scoring.
Let me conclude by quoting the words of the former Foreign Secretary and now deceased Member for Livingston, Robin Cook. In his resignation speech, he said:
",2016 Speech on the Iraq Inquiry Report,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/clive-lewis-2016-speech-on-the-iraq-inquiry-report/
James Brokenshire,United Kingdom,2019-03-28,"At autumn Budget 2016, the Government asked the Thames Estuary 2050 Growth Commission to develop an ambitious vision and delivery plan for North Kent, South Essex and East London up to 2050. In June 2018, the commission, led originally by Lord Heseltine and concluded by Sir John Armitt, announced their vision for the estuary. I sincerely ​thank Sir John and all the members of the commission for their expertise and scrutiny across the duration of the commission.
Comparable in scale to the midlands engine, northern powerhouse and Oxford-Cambridge arc, the Thames estuary has the potential to deliver growth to support the success of the whole of the UK economy. The Commission envisioned that by 2050 the
Thames estuary will be a tapestry of productive places along a global river. The estuary will create 1.3 million new jobs and generate £190 billion additional gross value added.
The Thames estuary has long been a gateway to the wider UK economy but there remain pockets of entrenched deprivation within the region. And this area is not yet fully delivering on its great potential.
I welcome the vision for growth that the commission has set out. I am pleased to announce further commitments from this Government to support the delivery of the commission’s vision, including: £1 million to support a new Thames estuary growth board; appointing a Cabinet-level ministerial champion; £4.85 million to support local partners to develop low-cost proposals for enhancing transport services between Abbey Wood and Ebbsfleet, subject to suitable housing ambition; exploring the potential for at least two new locally-led development corporations; launching a strategic communications campaign to promote the Thames estuary as a great place to live, work and do business; funding for the creation of masterplans and feasibility studies on key sites in the Thames estuary creative production corridor; and bringing together relevant authorities to collaborate on the Thames estuary 2100 plan, to make sure that growth in the estuary is sustainable and resilient. My full response is available: www.gov.uk.
Our response to the Thames Estuary 2050 Growth Commission marks this Government’s commitment to this important area of the country. The Thames estuary has great potential to provide well-balanced, inclusive economic growth and will remain vital for the UK economy following Brexit.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-08-04,"Let me begin by sending America’s deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed. Hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut. Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon. We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon and we will be there to help. It looks like a terrible attack. I also want to provide the latest on tropical storm Isaias. Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East coast and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible. I spoke to governor Cooper. I spoke to governor DeSantis and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA and they’re working very hard. Coastal areas in the storm’s path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents.
While inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds. FEMA is responding to states that have requested the assistance. We have a list of those states we can give them to you in a little while and my administration is monitoring the situation very closely. We have the military on guard, but we have FEMA is there in all cases. Corps of engineer is ready if needed, the army Corps of engineers, very talented people. I urge everyone in the storm’s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities. I now want to update you on the path forward having to do with the China virus. Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers which are rather spectacular that just came out. The manufacturing index of the Institute for supply management, that’s ISM. Most of you know it by ISM, increased for the third month in a row rising nearly two points in July to 54.2. That was fantastic.
The highest reading since March of 2019, this is remarkable considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest in particular virus hotspots. The ISM measures and it’s a very strong measure. New orders rose five points in July to 61.5 and its highest reading that would be since September of 2018, that’s a big number. Since the April load new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM dating back all the way to 1948. So 34 points that’s the largest since 1948. Similarly, the ISM’s measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest three month gain in over 70 years. That’s some number. These were somewhat surprising, but I’ve been saying we’re doing well and those numbers are really spectacular. Automobile sales likewise are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up stunningly. At 65% increase since then two 14.5 million units, which is a massive number. The great strength and great news is really four states like in particular, Michigan and Ohio, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, very good. Florida, little bit. These are great numbers, record setting numbers. The strength of new car sales is also evident in the used car market where soaring demand, literally soaring demand is putting upward pressure on the used car prices. This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry. The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector. And we think very substantially based on the numbers we’re very, very happy with these numbers. And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers in a very positive way.
Economy-wide inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter. Crash in that case means a good thing, not a bad thing. That’s the largest drop ever on record ever. Home builder sentiment likewise is soaring as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year. New homes recently made a 13 year high. So we have a 13 year high in new home construction. New business applications are very strong that just came out. The widely followed Atlanta fed GDP and it’s something that they have just come out with now. Forecasts see new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates. It looks like it’s showing a 20% annualized growth in the current quarter. So 20% in the current quarter, we’ll take that all day long. Let’s see if that’s right, that’s a projection. So we’ll see if that’s right. The Atlanta fed very respected.
The virus, back to that, we are continuing to monitor and monitor a particular hotspots across the South Southwest and the West. And we’re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well actually. Especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for ever since we’ve gotten to understand this horrible plague that’s been unleashed in our country by China. As of yesterday cases are declining in 70% of the jurisdictions compared to 36% last Monday. That’s a big, big number. 11 out of 13 states with the positive rate above 10% have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July. In other states, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always strong, even though the numbers are getting very good. States that have a test positivity rate between five and 10% and in the states with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them. We must ensure that these states do not become new flare ups so we’re watching them very, very closely.
Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths. Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak. So the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level. One is too much, one death because it should have never happened to us. It should have been stopped very easily by China in Wuhan. Thanks to our major advances in treatment we’ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups. Compared to April mortality rates are 85% lower among individuals aged 18 to 69 and 70% lower among individuals over 70 years old. We’ve also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly.
Approximately 85% of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65. Just getting some very accurate numbers on this. And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications. Since the pandemic began nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted living centers. That’s an incredible statistic when you hear that number. This data underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk as we race toward the development of a-
Highest risk. As we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly. And we’re doing that. We’re doing that at a level that we’ve never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense. And those with underlying conditions, especially the elderly with the underlying, whether it’s heart or diabetes. They seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems. While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately. And that’s what we’re doing. This is the science based approach. And it’s good with us, working very hard on that.
An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations while inflicting massive economic pain, long lasting damage on society and public health as a whole. So there won’t be locked downs, but we watch specific areas. We’re very careful and we’re putting out embers. We’re putting out flames. When you look at what’s happening with Miami and it’s going, the numbers are going down, but Florida is going down very significantly. Texas and California are going down rather significantly.
On telemedicine as we discussed the last time, and as I said numerous times during this day, it’s an incredible thing that’s happening. A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth. So seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes and that’s what’s happening. The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million. So from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week in total. 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began. That’s a tremendous thing that’s happened with telehealth.
As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines. Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks. And you’ve read and seen what’s happened today. Today’s news was very exciting.
Through operation warp speed we’re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we’re determined to have a vaccine very quickly with it. We’re going to have something very soon. We have great companies. These are among the greatest companies in the world. But right now they don’t like me so much because I’m forcing them to drop drug prices, prescription drug prices vary massively. Some of these companies are involved in that. Some of them aren’t. We’re having a tremendous… You’ll see a tremendous drop in price. We’re using favored nations. We’re using the rebates. We’re using everything. So long I’ve heard about how wealthy the middlemen are. They call them the middlemen and they are very wealthy. Nobody even knows who they are, but they’re very wealthy people. That we’re doing the rebates. We’re doing purchases from other countries like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to under a very bad system.
I don’t call it archaic. I call it bad because it’s meant really for drug companies to get higher prices. But under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 25 cents and ours is $2, we’re allowed to say, “We want favored nations. And we want the pill for the same, the same as the lowest country in the world.” If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that’s the price we’re going to get. Drug companies aren’t too happy about that, big pharma.
We’ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness. Today, the NIH were very exciting, announced that they’re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country. We’re going to move very quickly. Results look very good, already, incredible results.
More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway. And we’ve secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir. We’re really doing a job with it and it’s helping a lot of people. That’s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good, relatively speaking, that is. But that’s for American hospitals through the month of September. So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September. That’s big news.
The United States also has far and away, the most robust testing capacity in the world. Testing has been incredible, what we’ve been able to do. Nobody’s even close. Since March 12th, we’ve increased daily testing by 32,000%. How’s that? 32,000%. Somebody would say that must be a typo. It’s not a typo, 32,000%. We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly five million tests per week.
And now that we’re understanding the virus, we’re understanding very much what we’re doing with respect to who it affects, who it’s destroying and who gets away with it, like young people, very young people. We’ll be having some interesting statements having to do with testing and focus testing. I call it focus testing.
By comparison, Mexico, so we’re doing numbers that are incredible, but by comparison, Mexico, as you know, the president was here. He’s a great guy, but their numbers are much different. They do about 1 million tests. France has done 2.9 million tests. Canada’s around the 4 million mark. Australia is around the 4 million mark. The United States is testing more people in a single week than. In many cases, large segments or large well known countries, all put together. It’s been an amazing achievement, the testing and the quality of the testing also. And now we’re doing testing where you can have results in five minutes, seven minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting for it to come back from labs. Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Phoenix, Miami, Jacksonville, Florida, McAllen, Texas, Bakersfield, California. And this week we’re opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas, Atlanta. To date more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites.
Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual’s blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response. FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than… We have new numbers… More than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls and 21 billion gloves, billion. Can you believe that billion gloves? And we distribute that to the governors, different states. And when we get on the phone with them, they’re very happy. That I can tell you. No complaints from any of them. They’re very, very happy. What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we’ve done.
In our national stockpile, we’ve tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to 15 million and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000. These numbers are growing every day. And we’re now making thousands of ventilators, many thousands of ventilators a month. And we’re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators. They are very hard to produce. They’re very complicated machines. So we’re fully stocked here and we’ve made sure that every state is fully stocked, but we’re getting them to a lot of countries that need help.
We’ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine. I’m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. And I want to thank you all for being here. We’ll take a few questions. Yeah.
I want to thank you all for being here. We’ll take a few questions. Yeah, please.
No, I don’t know. I wasn’t involved in the deal. The concept of the deal is good, but I’ll let you know. We’ll do a little study on that. We’ll find out. If there is any problem, we’ll let you know about it very quickly, but I wasn’t involved in it. It’s a big deal. It’s a way of bringing back a great area too, in addition to pharmaceuticals. Kodak has been a great name, but obviously pretty much in a different business. And so we’ll see what that’s all about, but we’ll let you know very quickly. Yeah, please.
Well, it would seem like it based on the explosion. I’ve met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event. This was seems to be, according to them, they would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind. Yes.
Well, I think actually the numbers are lower than others. I’ll get back to you on that, but we proportionately are lower than almost all countries. We’re at the bottom of the list. And we’re relative to cases also, we’re at the bottom of the list, which is a good thing being at the bottom of the list, but I can get back to you. We have about four or five different lists on that. And we’re generally speaking at the very bottom of the list. So I’ll get back to you.
Well, a lot of our numbers were based on the New York, had a very tough time as you know. New York, New Jersey, that area. And when you take them out, just as an example, take a look at Florida relative to New York. That’s not to say anything wrong with New York. It was just a very tough place. People are close together, it’s crowded. It’s not easy. But when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in, I will get back to you but we have among the lowest numbers. They’ve done a fantastic job with it. Yeah. Go ahead.
Yes.
We are looking at it. We’re also looking at various other things that I’m allowed to do under the system and such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we’re allowed to do things. We’re talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean really bad management. So that seems to be where they … They’re looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats. In some case, radical left Democrats that have not done a good job. I appreciate today the Wall Street Journal said very good things that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in Homeland Security. Chad Wolf and the folks, we went into Portland and we’ve done a great job.
And they had that in an editorial that we really won that situation. But we want the whole … We did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in, we took care of it and we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said. As far as the various things that I may or may not sign, I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made as you know, very well in the hill. We’ll see what happens. But I have the right, including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things. We want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It’s not their fault. It’s China’s fault. It’s not their fault. And people are being evicted and we can do that with an executive order.
So if we don’t get … And we want to do it relatively quickly. I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted and then they go into shelters and there are thousands of people in the shelters, and this is not a time … You never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it and it’s no good. So I may have to do something on evictions too because the Democrats amazingly don’t want to do it. We offered them short term deals and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out states that have been poorly managed by Democrats. Okay.
Did you say that’s impressive? Did you actually use that term?
Oh. Well, it’s almost the same thing. Not quite. I like impressive. I like impressive. Not quite but close. So tick tack. TikTok is very successful. It does tremendous business in the United States. People are riveted by it. I mean, I have many friends, when they saw that announcement, that calling, I think their kids love it. They don’t because they don’t get to see their kids anymore, but they are … It’s an amazing thing, whatever it may be. And I told Microsoft and frankly others, if they want to do it, if they make a deal for TikTok, whether it’s the 30% in the United States or the whole company, I say, it’s okay. But if you do that, we’re really making it possible because we’re letting you operate here. So the United States treasury would have to benefit also, not just the sellers.
And I said, inform …
Very simple. I mean, we have all the cards because without us, you can’t come into the United States. It’s like, if you’re a landlord and you have a tenant, the tenant’s business needs rent. It needs a lease. And so what I said to them is whatever the price is, a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the treasury of the United States. And they understood that and actually they agreed with me. I mean, I think they agreed with me very much.
Yeah, please in the back.
So that deal may or may not happen. We’ve given them till September 15th or so. And we’ll see if we can have it and if they can be great security, meaning the obvious security, Microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect or approved in that respect at many levels, including working with the Department of Defense and they’re very high level approvals. So it would be good. But there are the companies also. Yes please.
No we’ve had other companies call us. Microsoft called me directly and we’ve had other companies call. I don’t know where they are. It sounds like Microsoft is along the way of doing something. I don’t blame them. It would be … It’s a great company. But we can’t take the security risk. I think our attitude on China has changed greatly since the China virus hit us. I think it changed greatly. It hit the world and it shouldn’t have. They should have been able to stop it. So we feel differently. I just don’t know. When you lose so many thousands of people and ultimately …
So many thousands of people and, you know, ultimately it’ll be millions of people around the world. It’s a terrible thing that happened to the United States and Europe and the entire world. Really a terrible thing. Yes, please.
We do more testing than anybody in the world, as I explained. And I don’t mean just a little bit. If you look at India, they’re at about 11 million. We’re at 61 million. And, there comes a point when you just, you want to focus your testing in a different way and we’ll be announcing stuff.
What we’ve done is incredible with the testing. Not only the testing, not only the number of tests, but also very importantly, the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the test. Nobody thought it would be possible to get a five- minute and a 15-minute result. That’s a very accurate result, and we do with Abbott. Abbott Laboratories has done a great job. Many of these companies have done an incredible job.
So we’re looking at that very strongly. And we’re looking at doing something that if we do it… Look, right now, what the testing is doing is helpful, but we’re spending massive amounts of money and we want to have it channeled very accurately. We want to be able to help the most people we can. But, we are testing at a level that no country in the world, and I’ve spoken to the leaders of the world and they’ll ask me about it. No country in the world thought it would be it’s even believable that we’re able to test so much. 61 million versus, you know, most countries don’t even test. You know when they test? When somebody is feeling badly. If somebody is feeling badly, they’re symptomatic, that’s when they test. And that’s a big difference.
With us we go around and looking because if we find spots, we find hotspots. One problem is from the standpoint of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally show. So it’s, you know, as I called it the other day in a statement I said, “It’s called media gold.” You know, for the media, it’s gold. But the truth is it’s… We’ve done an incredible job in testing. Nobody in the world has done the job. Other leaders have told me the same thing. They can’t believe we’re able to do it. And we will continue, but we want to really be able to test very specifically the people that are in most danger, most in need.
Okay, I’m glad you’re asking.
So, Florida’s got a great Republican governor and it had a great Republican governor, Scott. Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott, two great governors. And over a long period of time, they’ve been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally. Florida is different from other states. I mean, in Nevada, we have a governor, he said, “Let’s just send out millions of ballots.” And the post office cannot be prepared. I haven’t spoken to the post office about it, but I don’t know how they could possibly be prepared.
Florida has been working on this for years and they have a very good system of mail-in and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So in the case of Florida, there aren’t too many people that would qualify, they’re so well-run. Florida’s a very well run state, low taxes, low everything. They’ve done a great job, really a great job. And the two governors, between the both of them, they’ve really got a great system of absentee ballots and even in the case of mail-in ballots. The postal services are built up there. You know, it takes a long time.
When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they… And, I’ll give you the story. I think you have to do that election over. That election is no good. You have to take a look. In New York, they have thousands of ballots. They don’t know what happened to them. Is there fraud? Is there… It’s a disaster. That’s only for a relatively small number of ballots, but I think they have to do the election in New York over. The Times wrote a big story about it yesterday, front page story. It’s a disaster. It’s a mess. And they have to do that… I think they have to do that election over. Nobody can know what the election result is.
So, in the case of Florida, they’ve done a great job. They’ve had tremendous success with it, but they’ve been doing this over many years and they’ve made it really terrific. So for Florida, you can mail in your ballots. You don’t have to go. In maybe a couple of other states they’ve worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn’t take weeks or months.
In the case of Nevada, they’re going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can’t do that. I can’t imagine the post office could do it. All of a sudden they’re supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots, but Florida has done a great job. And we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in Florida, it’s going to matter.
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
","Donald Trump Coronavirus Press Conference Transcript August 4: Talks Isaias, Eviction, Mail-in Voting",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-press-conference-transcript-august-4-talks-isaias-eviction-mail-in-voting
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-01-26,"Please. They’re good genes, the Jack Nicklaus genes over there.
So Jackie is your father?
I don’t know if you ever heard this, but he made one of the best speeches I’ve ever seen, in the Rotunda right?
Right. The congressional whatever it is.
Freedom Medal.
Which is a big deal and your father made one of the best speeches I’ve ever seen.
And that’s pretty good, I’ve seen a lot of speeches.
But I said, “Are you a professional speaker?” He said, “No.” I said, “Then maybe you should be.”
So what is it your cousin or whatever had the hole in one the other day?
That was something. The swing looks good. How good a golfer is he?
Oh really? His swing looked…
His swing looked perfect, yeah. He has the gene I guess, right?
Did it really? Why are you not that good of a golfer?
What was your lowest handicap?
What’s that?
Oh yeah, it’s a great family. Say hello to all.
Special guy.
Special people. Thank you all very much. Great to be with you. You see what’s happening? We’re doing really well. I don’t know why, I get nothing but bad publicity and the polls keep going up. They’re at the highest level they’ve ever been since we’ve been in office. Quite a bit higher than election day, which was pretty amazing. That was an amazing day, right?
I told your grandfather that, he said it was incredible. I said, what you did is more incredible. You won 18 Majors. He said, “No, it’s not.” I said, “Yes it is.” I still say it. It’s harder and more improbable to win 18 Majors. Just ask Tiger, right?
It looks like it’s going to be a tough one. But we’re doing better than ever before and we’re accomplishing a lot. The North Korea thing is moving along really well. We have a site now, we picked a site. They announce pretty soon and a location plus a date. He really wants to do something, I’ll tell you. Part of the reason he wants to do two things, I mean maybe the rhetoric and maybe we put sanctions like you wouldn’t believe. The team is heading over to China today, tonight to work on the whole trade craziness because they’ve been averaging $500 billion a year.
Somebody has to. It’s brutal. They’re tough. But I always say when you’re $500 billion down, you can’t lose the trade war. You can’t lose. It’s like somebody said today, because I’m doing a very aggressive thing, this is all like off the record, right? But they said, “Why would you be doing that with China blah blah blah. You could do much less,” I said, “Yeah but much less doesn’t get you…” I said this is like you own a baseball team and it’s the first inning and the other team scores 32 runs, what do you have to lose? You walk away, you start a new game the next day. 32 runs in the first inning because that’s basically what it is. We’re $500 billion down with China. We’re $800 billion down throughout the world. $800 billion a year.
So we lose $800 billion in a year. Then you have the globalists that think that’s okay, but they’re wrong. They think it’s fine when a factory or a plant moves to Mexico and opens up and you lose 3,000 jobs in Michigan. It’s not. You have people, smart people they really believe it but then you have other smart people that don’t believe and I’m one of them.
Tell me and I hear steel is doing better now.
We put very substantial tariffs on steel. We’re doing pretty big numbers on stopping some of it from coming in. I don’t want to stop too much because I don’t want to run out of steel because the economy is doing really well. Are you finding it’s better now because of what I’m doing?
They do.
Can you believe it?
We’re doing a big number for them, can you believe it?
So they do the transshipping, right?
So they’re transshipping what steel? China’s steel?
Yeah, South Korea. I could write a book on it.
How we ever got involved in South Korea in the first place, tell me about it.
Not only that, I mean they’re one of the toughest traders we do business with. They’re probably tougher than China, they’re just smaller so the numbers are smaller. We have a $32 billion deficit with South Korea. I asked the General, “Why do you think we’re doing this service for trade?” I say, “We’re $500 billion in that area.” We’re doing this for trade, but we’re losing $500 billion including China. We’re losing $32 billion with South Korea. It’s crazy but it is what it is and it’s coming out good. A lot of good things are happening and the trade deals are being renegotiated, including the deal with South Korea. What do you think of the quota deal we had?
We lowered it by 30%.
I don’t want to be at a point where we don’t have enough steel in this country. All of a sudden steel triples.
Did you know what we’re doing with South Korea, 30%?
30% back.
Don’t forget when I do the tariffs and nobody talks about that, they talk about jobs, they talk about steel. Now steel has been doing much better and your steel is opening up like four plants now, which is unthinkable. They haven’t done it in 30 years. Don’t forget that the country’s taking in billions of dollars. Nobody talks about that. When you charge 25% and 15% or 10% for aluminum and all that stuff is pouring in and you’re charging a 25% tax, so the steel that’s coming in, we’re taking in as a country billions of dollars. Nobody talks about that.
They talk about jobs and they talk about steel plants. But to me the big thing, I mean we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars by doing nothing. We’re also negotiating deals that we could’ve never negotiated because countries are now coming to us begging to negotiate deals that had been screwing us for years. They’ve been screwing us so badly it’s hard to believe and now they’re coming, “We’d like to talk,” like the European Union. That’s another beauty. We don’t make with anybody, we lose with everybody. There are about two countries, one sells us lemons, Argentina. We made about $3 with Argentina. We have actually a trade deficit of $800 billion including.
Well the WTO is the problem.
Without the WTO China’s…
That’s right they go to a different location.
Yeah they get it in all sorts of ways, but it ends, it ends.
If it was more expensive?
Well, you’re going to see prices go up. Hopefully not too much. See, I have a theory that if we didn’t put quotas on it, China subsidizes their steel, they have to. If we didn’t see quotas, the steel wouldn’t even go up. Because they’ll put more money into it even with the 25% tax, it’s still not going to come up because they’ll just put more money into it. We take it a lot of money, we make a fortune on it, so we’ll see. Aluminum has gone down. I put a 10% tax on aluminum coming in, it’s actually gone down 4%. Now it’s about even, but it actually started out going down 4%.
So it’s been pretty wild. I think we’re going to have some very good times, but we have some very big trade deals to worry about. China, when they hear what we’re proposing, they’re not going to be too happy.
Well the WTO is worse than them. The WTO is totally in their pocket. The people that made the deal with the WTO were not smart people. They made a deal with the WTO where we lose every lawsuit until the last year. In the last year we’ve won every lawsuit because they often got to pull our country out.
We’re like the punching bag. We’re like the dummies that get punched in the face all day long and come back for more. But they now know that I get the WTO. China didn’t become great until the WTO. From the day they joined the WTO, which was a Clinton disaster, they went up like a rocket ship. They were this way for 1,000 years and then they got into the WTO and they’ve taken it… Look, I give them credit.
Yeah, but I give them credit.
Bush, he gets us into the war. He gets us into the Middle East, that was a beauty. So we’re in the Middle East right now for $7 trillion. If you want to fix a window on a school, they don’t have the money. But we’re into the Middle East as of this moment for $7 trillion, now that’s over 18 years.
Yeah, probably.
Well that’s the beauty of it. China rips us off for years and we owe them $2 trillion and $2 trillion more through our bonds.
Yeah well eventually that’s what we’ll do.
So the WTO allowed China to do what they’re doing. The WTO was a weapon to hurt the United States, to allow people to enrich themselves. The European Union’s the same thing. The European Union is a group of countries that got together to screw the United States. It’s as simple as that. Frankly, they’re probably worse than China in a sense, just smaller. They’re worse than China in the sense of barriers. We lose $151 billion to them.
Yeah, but the European Union’s really bad. It doesn’t sound like it. The European Union, we’re all sort of from there, right? But the European Union’s brutal, but we’re changing that around too. They can’t even believe it. So we’re having fun, it’s what we do.
But you have people that work for me that just don’t realize they’re so… They want to make these deals, they’re just nothing deals. Not only Congress when they come, “Please don’t go after NAFTA too hard.” I said, “I’d like to terminate it.” It’s like oh my God, they’re petrified because they know what they have. Like the farmers who are great, actually, the farmers know what they have and they’ve been on a downward trend for 15 years. So I said, look, you guys are on a downward trend, you could be on an upward trend, but to do that you have to shake it up. Meaning you terminate a couple of deals like NAFTA. NAFTA’s the worst deal we ever made. I think that WTO is actually the worst deal ever. I think the World Trade Organization maybe is worse because it allowed China to kill us, but we don’t have any good ones. Hillary Clinton made a deal with the South Koreans, that was a South Korean deal. You know that deal, that was a Hillary special. We’re going to make 250,000 jobs and she was right, for South Korea. Good job. She said this is going to create 250,000 jobs. 250,000 jobs and she was right, in South Korea.
Have you seen it?
Is it a nice club?
Is that where they had the… What?
How did you like the Presidents Cup?
So the Presidents Cup has never been the Ryder Cup and you think the concept is better. The Ryder Cup is the most unbelievable sporting event. The Presidents Cup is good, but it’s never been the same. You would think the concept is better.
You know what doesn’t make sense, we’re playing Britain or whatever, UK and that competition is tougher than when we play the world. Figure that one out.
No, but isn’t that right? The Ryder Cup is tough to win. The Ryder Cup is only the UK, but the spirit at the Ryder Cup is really a unique experience and the Presidents Cup so far has never captured it.
Don’t they have a women’s tournament too, a big one?
How’s it doing? How’s business over there? Good?
Oh in South Korea?
I wrote you a letter of recommendation, right?
No that letter is fine. I know they have the letter because the President told me he got the letter. So they must be treating you pretty good.
It must be tough dealing with these people.
Go ahead.
We’re very far down the line, but I will. You know that Kim Jong-un is a great golfer you know that right?
Did you ever hear that? He shot an 18.
Absolutely. Thank you fellas that was good. Business is good, look at this. Business is good, right. No, he said today that President Trump should get the Nobel Prize. I said it’s a little early because Obama got it and never did anything.
He got it for winning the election.
Are you doing the shiny finish or are you doing a rough finish?
I can’t believe how they can plant that thing.
That’s great. Are you doing that with the Army Corps of Engineers?
That’s great. Well it’s going up.
It’s going up.
Do you see what’s going on at the border though? Can you believe it?
Well you take a look at that, you’ve got thousands of people and if you really look to take the wall down, they’d just keep walking in. You can see it, now a few people can get up. It’s amazing that they can shimmy up that steel though. Now that’s old stuff and it’s rough on the outside and rusty, it’s been there a long time. You do have to be able to see through the wall I think. If you can’t see through the wall that’s a problem because then you don’t know what’s on the other side.
Because I really wanted a concrete wall 30 feet high, very slick outside. You know they actually said that these drug dealers, it’s so dangerous to have a solid wall because they take the drugs and it weighs a hundred pounds approximately, a bag or satchel, they call it a satchel. They throw it out over the wall and it goes over the wall and it will land on a guys head and it kills him.
No our border guys will be walking and they throw it from one side. So if you can’t see through the wall, they throw the drugs, they have a catapult, they throw it over the wall and it lands on the other side of the wall. It can hit people. Can you imagine you get hit with a hundred pounds of drugs.
No, no.
They usually have the deals on the other side ready, but when they see the border guys they head out. The whole thing is preposterous. I would’ve loved to have seen a concrete wall, you just can’t do that.
We actually have the new one is like that now it’s taller, it’s got the thing. It’s got nothing in between. It’s held to the ground like lead bolts and it’s got very strong points at the top. That’ll be much tougher.
It’s like pointed, yeah a wall.
How sharp is that?
That’s pretty cool.
It’s very hard to shimmy over that.
Well I know.
As you know, most times you don’t. But I think the economy is so good. That’s good. That’s fine. I guess it’s complacency. Something happens when you win the presidency, then you go on and you win the presidency 10 years after that. History, it’s almost like 100% of… it’s a lot. There’s nothing 100%, I think-
… it’s a lot. There’s nothing 100%. I think 93% of the time, they lose the Mid-cap. But look, we have to see what the economy is in a few months.
I think so, right?
The stock market’s up 40% since I won. But actually, the economy is actually better than that.
It’s all changing.
This whole caravan is a positive thing because it’s showing people how crazy it is.
But they won the race in Arizona three nights ago. Of course, we’re getting no credit for that. They’re saying we shut it, because I won it by 22. She won it by six.
I would’ve taken the, two votes is okay as far as I’m concerned. The headline is, “Oh, it was much closer.” We lose and then they win. You know we won six of them and nobody talks about it. We won six special races. I think we lost one, and we lost the one in Pennsylvania.
Well, that was the most exciting evening.
ESPN said that was the greatest sporting event.
It just didn’t stop. It’s Ohio. It’s this one.
And honestly, they’re going more crazy now. The press is now more crazy.
Well, I think the press is now more crazy than they were. They’re going totally bananas.
It’s all right. What the heck. I think we’re going to do well. Well, they have low light. You have this one woman, Maxine Waters. She’s a very low IQ person.
You don’t hear from her anymore, it’s the craziest thing. Since I’ve said that, I don’t hear from her anymore. Really. It’s crazy. How’s the food? Good?
It could be good.
People think about it, right?
She’s really become-
How are your businesses going? How are they doing?
So, why are the prices so high? There’s so much oil and gas.
Is that OPEC? But oil is so high. Oil’s almost at 70.
Huh?
Well, it’s the monopoly of OPEC pricing.
Aren’t the frackers-
Yeah. Aren’t the frackers out now because of the price, and they’re going crazy opening up new wells?
That’s what I’ve heard.
Is the fracking starting, Lynn? Because for a while now, the price was too low and then it goes up.
So will that drive the price home. Is it going to?
So, how big is West Texas? Comparing West Texas to Saudi Arabia okay, what’s your difference?
60? Is that right?
That’s a lot.
What’s the quality in West Texas?
So what’s the quality of Venezuela? Very bad right? It’s very heavy?
And is that hurting oil prices?
You need what? New refineries.
Under the tax plan, we can—
Yeah, just put it down.
When was that?
Yep. But that’s more expensive.
Well how about Germany opening up a pipeline into Russia? We’re supposed to be fighting Russia. So Germany is paying Russia like $2 billion a month.
And they’re a member of NATO.
And we’re paying 90% of the cost of NATO.
How’s Ukraine doing? Don’t ask.
Great. I’ll tell you, they’re great fighters.
I think they are. They’re great fighters. They’ve been fighting for so long, they don’t know what to do without fighting.
Yeah, well they’ve been fighting for a long time.
But, it’s a problem, a big problem.
Today?
Do you think Russia ever goes in and gets Ukraine or no?
Ukraine has oil?
Ukraine.
Why aren’t the companies doing it? Too risky?
How long will they last in a fight with Russia?
How’s Ukraine feeling about it all right now?
No, but do they feel they’re going to be okay?
What do you think of the leader?
See it’s always us that has to support everybody.
And you wonder why isn’t Germany supporting?
Germany is not doing much.
You think so?
It just makes no sense.
It makes no sense.
Where? The ambassador where? Ukraine?
Really?
“He’ll be gone tomorrow.”
Get rid of her. Get her out tomorrow. I don’t care, get her out tomorrow. Take her out, okay? Do it.
Pompeo is going to be good. He’s doing a good job. Already he’s done a good job. Now we got to go, I’m pretty good. We got a lot of interesting things.
No it’s a deep state deal but it’s going good. You see the other side.
Yeah. The stuff that they have is so bad about the other side, that they’re trying to keep it. It’s now coming out.
Yeah I have to wait. I’m waiting for the timing, the right timing.
It’s such bad stuff. Like Combe is guilty already.
Every time he goes on television he gets another-
But they’re not so happy.
Thank you sir.
Thank you everybody. Guys enjoy your meal, whatever it is.
I can’t have different from other people. Who wants a steak? Who wants a steak?
I was going to say they brought my a shrimp cocktail, I’m looking who else has one?
The hotel’s pretty great.
What?
Yeah, and what led cannabis, look, you mean you’re talking about marijuana right?
Why? You can’t do banking there?
Yeah, it’ll be, it’s all working out. That whole thing is-
But do you think the whole marijuana thing is a good thing?
In Colorado they have more accidents. It does cause an IQ problem.
But it’s actually good for opioids.
How’s Florida doing now with Rich Scott?
How’s he doing?
Is he going to win or is it-
How are you doing?
So now, what are you doing?
Oh good.
Poland is great.
How’s that going.
At the time it was the right thing to do.
So are you just sort of sitting back now? He was telling me he’s just going to sit back and, who cares? Or is he-
At 78, five years is a long time.
It’s happening. Between him and your father, they’re great designers. And they work, you don’t want to waste five years. At the end of five years you can do what you want to do?
Which he likes any way.
It’s just an exhausting part, because I know him. I know the guy.
Did he buy it?
Howard bought Golf magazine. Bought if for $15 million. 10 years ago you would have paid $300 million.
15. Can you believe that?
Magazines are dead.
I think cable TV is okay, right? Is it? I will say, if we ever lost an election, cable TV is dead. You can imagine if they had a normal candidate. That’s all they talk about. Trump stories, Trump, Trump, Trump, that’s all they talk about. They have a normal candidate. They had Hilary, crooked Hilary.
Their ratings would be 1/5th.
That’s why I tell everybody they’re going to endorse me. About six months before the election they’ll endorse me and then they’ll un-endorse me after that. Now, but they’re bad, they’re bad.
Obama would have been easier. Second term.
Romney should have never lost anything. Obama would have been much easier second term.
I think so.
All those people that hated her so much who voted for me. I got 20% of Bernie vote, people don’t realize that, because of trade. He’s a big trade guy. He’s basically said we’re getting screwed on trade, and he’s right. And we can do something about it. Had she picked Bernie Sanders, it could have been tougher.
If they had a conversation.
Of course.
Is he going to be running again?
I think he might.
Because he does a lot of television. Usually when they do a lot of television that means they’re running.
I like him because I’m a big Giuliani fan. I hope Biden runs.
Well, that’s good though. Right?
Yeah, but we’re going to lower them.
You know that the café standard?
Is that what business are in, compression?
Compressed or-
They make the compressors to move the natural gas through the pipeline.
How are electric cars doing now?
Well, Tesla, he’s got an electric car.
Why?
Because they can’t produce them.
How come the stock price is so high?
But the stock is still doing very nice.
So that’s a third type of car now you’re talking about?
It is?
Why is that?
Is that the aluminum one?
What do you think of it?
Oh, you like it?
Is it strong enough?
Does it dent easier?
Does it dent easier? You think so?
You have the aluminum body?
And did you request that?
Has that turned out to be a good investment for them, or not?
It’s lighter?
Also, repairing aluminum stuff-
So is that happening?
Why.
But people still like gasoline cars?
They really don’t want the aluminum. I mean, they don’t want the electric. They majority is still gas.
Is hybrid working?
But not great?
People still like gasoline right?
That’s interesting.
You like 547s?
Wait, but you said it doesn’t have the power and it doesn’t run as well. I think that is wonderful.
But maybe you’re taking the routes that may not be the most effective route?
What do you mean trucks? What do you mean trucks. What do you do?
Oh, I see. So you know the difference, right? You have every kind. Is there anything like gasoline?
How is diesel compared to regular gasoline.
Oh, I see. Why can’t you? It’s not as strong?
But in mail trucks you’re using diesel?
And you’ve tried with the compressed gas?
And how do you find them?
But you said it’s more expensive.
You can’t get trucks?
You can’t buy them?
So you say you don’t have manufacturers that can make enough trucks?
You can’t get drivers?
You mean they can only drive so much?
So they have a method that you shut down a truck?
What happens if you have two drivers?
How’s Amazon doing?
That’s what the other guys are starting now, Walmart and all these.
I know them very well.
They’re ripping off the post office.
But 40% of the business you do is with Amazon. And they don’t pay-
They say it’s 40. They actually said it’s 40.
How is the postal service doing?
Really?
Why can’t you put them with cars?
How safe is autonomous?
I don’t think so. I said I was going to spend $1 billion building a building, I spent $150, 000.
We took the building and we just … did you ever hear that?
So we were going to spend $1 billion on the embassy in Jerusalem. And I had to pay for it. And David, he said we can take the existing building that we have-
Yeah, take a corner of the building.
So, I said, you don’t have to make it $150,000. Make it $250,000. It took like three months to build.
It would’ve been 10 years before it opened.
That doesn’t mean we’re not going to knock it down. But they have a building on an existing that’s a better location, the best location.
It’s even set back. It’s a fairly large site, a setback, which is good for safety.
Yeah. So they took a corner of the building, fixed it for $150,000.
So instead of the $1 billion, they spent $150,000. Isn’t that amazing?
For $150,000 versus a billion, and we have a better location because there was no location as good.
Yeah. Go ahead.
So folks, I want to thank you all very much. I’ll get back.
It’s not a long trip.
Because every time I’m here you’re moving at about 125. You never saw anything like it. It’s incredible. And they do a great job. The Secret Service does. But we have like 115 cars. So it’s not that easy to come over. Don always says, “Oh can we do it outside of the White House. I guess, I don’t know-
There’s a ridiculous campaign thing about that, which I think is wrong. Doesn’t make sense. They spend a fortune getting over here.
Costs nothing.
I’m sure it’s a mistake. But I like this hotel anyway.
Yeah give it to me, where is it?
That is true.
You don’t have to sign it.
I want Jack Nicklaus to sign it.
He’s a good guy.
See the other side doesn’t want to go to South Carolina, which I understand. Let me see it. Did you sign it?
That’s very nice. Easy job, right?
Good. Hold that for me, will you?
Thank you everybody.
Good job.

Barack Obama,United States of America,2012-02-01,"Thank you so much. Everybody please have a seat. Have a seat. It is great to be back in Falls Church. Thank you for having me.
Last week, in my State of the Union, I laid out my blueprint for an economy that’s built to last. And I want to assure you I am not going to go over the whole thing again this morning. That was a long speech. I'm not going to repeat the whole thing. But I do want to talk about some of the issues that I discussed last week because the blueprint we put forward was one that focuses on restoring what have always been this country's greatest strengths -- American manufacturing, American energy, skills and education for American workers so that we can compete with anybody around the world in this 21st century economy, and most importantly, the American values of fairness and responsibility. Fairness and responsibility.
Now, we know what happens, because we've just seen it -- what happened when we stray from those values. We saw what happened over the past decade when we strayed from those values-- especially when it comes to the massive housing bubble that burst and hurt so many people. Millions of families who did the right and the responsible thing, folks who shopped for a home that they could afford, secured a mortgage, made their payments each month -- they were hurt badly by the irresponsible actions of other people who weren’t playing by the same rules, weren’t taking the same care, weren’t acting as responsibly. By lenders who sold loans to people who they knew couldn’t afford the mortgages; and buyers who bought homes they knew they couldn’t afford; and banks that packaged those mortgages up and traded them to reap phantom profits, knowing that they were building a house of cards.
It was wrong. It was wrong. It triggered the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. And it has been the single biggest drag on our recovery from a terrible recession. Crushing debt has kept millions of consumers from spending. A lack of building demand has kept hundreds of thousands of construction workers idle. Everybody involved in the home-building business -- folks who make windows, folks who make carpets -- they've all been impacted. The challenge is massive in size and in scope, because we've got a multitrillion-dollar housing industry. And economists can tell you how it’s affected all sorts of statistics, from GDP to consumer confidence.
It’s personal. It affects so much of how people feel about their lives, about their communities, about the country, about the economy. We need to do everything in our power to repair the damage and make responsible families whole again. Everything we can. 
Now, the truth is it’s going to take more time than any of us would like for the housing market to fully recover from this crisis. This was a big bubble, and when it burst it had a big effect. Home prices started a pretty steady decline about five years ago. And government certainly can’t fix the entire problem on its own. But it is wrong for anybody to suggest that the only option for struggling, responsible homeowners is to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom. I refuse to accept that, and so do the American people.
There are more than 10 million homeowners across the country right now who, because of an unprecedented decline in home prices that is no fault of their own, owe more on their mortgage than their homes are worth. It means your mortgage, your house is underwater.
Here in Falls Church, home values have fallen by about a quarter from their peak. In places like Las Vegas, more than half of all homeowners are underwater. More than half. So it’s going to take a while for those prices to rise again. But there are actions we can take right now to provide some relief to folks who've been responsible, have done the right thing, and are making their payments on time.
Already, thanks to the outstanding work, in part, of my Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Shaun Donovan, who's here today -- yes, there he is, the good-looking guy in the front here. The housing plan we launched a couple years ago has helped nearly 1 million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, and they’re saving an average of $300 on their payments each month -- $300 -- which is great. 
But I’ll be honest -- the programs that we put forward haven’t worked at the scale that we hoped. Not as many people have taken advantage of it as we wanted. Mortgage rates are as low as they’ve been in half a century, and when that happens, usually homeowners flock to refinance their mortgages -- so a lot of people take advantage of it and save a lot of money. But this time too many families haven’t been able to take advantage of the low rates, because falling prices lock them out of the market. They were underwater; made it more difficult for them to refinance.
Then you’ve got all the fees involved in refinancing. And a lot of people just said, you know what, even though I’d like to be, obviously, cutting down my monthly payment, the banks just aren’t being real encouraging.
So last year we took aggressive action that allowed more families to participate. And today we’re doing even more. This is the main reason I’m here today. 
As I indicated at the State of the Union last week, I am sending Congress a plan that will give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. And a small fee on the largest financial institutions will make sure it doesn’t add to our deficit.
What this plan will do is help millions of responsible homeowners who make their payments on time but find themselves trapped under falling home values or wrapped up in red tape.
If you’re ineligible for refinancing just because you’re underwater on your mortgage, through no fault of your own, this plan changes that. You’ll be able to refinance at a lower rate. You’ll be able to save hundreds of dollars a month that you can put back in your pocket. Or you can choose those savings to rebuild equity in your homes, which will help most underwater homeowners come back up for air more quickly.
Now, to move this part of my plan, we’re going to need Congress to act. We’re going to need Congress to act. I hear some murmuring in the audience here. We need them to act. But we’re not just going to wait for Congress. We’re going to keep building a firewall to prevent the same kinds of abuses that led this crisis -- led to this crisis in the first place. So there are things we can do administratively that are also going to help responsible homeowners. 
Already, we’ve set up a special task force I asked my Attorney General to establish to investigate the kind of activity banks took when they packaged and sold risky mortgages. And that task force is ramping up its work as we speak. We’re going to keep at it and hold people who broke the law accountable and help restore confidence in the market. We’re going to speed assistance to homeowners. And we’re going to turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many hardworking Americans. 
Today, I’m also proposing a Homeowners Bill of Rights -- one straightforward set of common-sense rules of the road that every family knows they can count on when they’re shopping for a mortgage. No more hidden fees or conflicts of interest. No more getting the runaround when you call about your loan. No more fine print that you used to get families to take a deal that is not as good as the one they should have gotten. New safeguards against inappropriate foreclosures. New options to avoid foreclosure if you’ve fallen on hardship or a run of bad luck. And a new, simple, clear form for new buyers of a home. 
Now, think about it. This is the most important purchase a family makes. But how many of you have had to deal with overly complicated mortgage forms and hidden clauses and complex terms? I remember when Michelle and I bought our first condo -- and we're both lawyers. And we’re looking through the forms and kind of holding it up -- reading it again -- ""What does this phrase mean?"" And that’s for two trained lawyers. The forms, the confusion, the potential for abuse is too great just because the forms were too complicated.
So this is what a mortgage form should look like. This is it. Now that our new consumer watchdog agency is finally running at full steam now that Richard Cordray is in as the Director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau -- they’re moving forward on important protections like this new, shorter mortgage form. Simple, not complicated. Informative, not confusing. Terms are clear. Fees are transparent.
This, by the way, is what some of the folks in Congress are trying to roll back and prevent from happening.
Americans making a down payment on their dreams shouldn’t be terrified by pages and pages of fine print. They should be confident they’re making the right decision for their future.
There’s more that we’re announcing today. We’re working to turn more foreclosed homes into rental housing, because as we know and a lot of families know, that empty house or “for sale” sign down the block can bring down the price of homes across the neighborhood. We’re working to make sure people don’t lose their homes just because they lose their jobs. These are steps that can make a concrete difference in people’s lives right now. 
As I said earlier, no program or policy will solve all the problems in a multitrillion-dollar housing market. The heights of the housing bubble reached before it burst, those were unsustainable, and it’s going to take time to fully recover. That requires everybody to do their part.
As much as our economic challenges were born of eroding home values and portfolio values, they were also born of an erosion of some old-fashioned American values. An economy that’s built to last, that’s on a firm foundation, so that middle-class families have a sense of security and those who want to get in the middle class can make it if they’re working hard -- that demands responsibility from everyone.
Government must take responsibility for rules that are fair and fairly enforced. Banks and lenders must be held accountable for ending the practices that helped cause this crisis in the first place. And all of us have to take responsibility for our own actions -- or lack of action. 
So I urge Congress to act. Pass this plan. Help more families keep their homes. Help more neighborhoods remain vibrant. Help keep more dreams defended and alive. And I promise you that I’ll keep doing everything I can to make the future brighter for this community, for this commonwealth, for this country.
Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. 
",Address on Housing at Falls Church,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamahousingfallschurch.htm
Scott Mann,United Kingdom,2019-06-16,"Good evening, Mr Deputy Speaker. Meur ras—thank you—for allowing me to speak in the debate. The people of Cornwall will be saluting you.
I come from a part of the country that has a very proud history and culture. Our population dates back to the stone age and is steeped in history and lore, particularly in mining and fishing. Some of our ancient traditions still exist today. Every year in Cornwall, people participate in the ancient tradition of hurling through the streets, and in the merry mornings of May, the ’Obby ’Osses descend through the streets of Padstow. In recent times, we have seen a huge resurgence in the sport of gig rowing. We are proud in Cornwall to be home to those historical cultural events, which are unique to our county.
Today, I wish to shine a spotlight on Cornish wrestling. I will, if I may, refer to Cornish wrestling in the Cornish tongue for the rest of the debate—I will be referring to wrestling as “wrasslin”. That is how we describe it in Cornwall. I have had a large number of media requests about this debate, which I was not expecting.
Cornish wrasslin bears no relation to the wrestling that people may have seen on television. It is not WWE. There are no ropes, nothing to jump off and no cage fights or tag teams. The sport of wrasslin in Cornwall sums up the Cornish very well. It is a game of power, skill and strength. Cornish wrasslin is a form of wrestling that has been established in Cornwall for several centuries. It is a unique sport that has witnessed a steady revival since the establishment of the Cornish Wrestling Association in 1920.
The history of wrasslin was recorded first in “The History of the Kings of Britain” in 1139, in which Geoffrey of Monmouth suggested that Corineus, the medieval legend, wrestled a Cornish giant named Gogmagog at Plymouth Hoe. Two Cornishmen were recorded in a poem of 1590 entitled “Poly-Olbion” at the battle of Agincourt, carrying carried a banner of two Cornish wrasslers in a hitch or a hold. In the 17th century, historian Richard Carew wrote of Cornish wrestling:
“Wrasslin is as full of manliness, more delightful and less dangerous”
than hurling. I can just imagine two burly Cornishmen, with hands the size of shovels, striding out into battle at Agincourt, proud of their sport and proud of their county.
In more recent times, we have seen a mini revival. Both Devon and Brittany have a history of wrasslin, and they have competed with Cornwall in inter-Celtic matches. Cornish wrasslin is the oldest sport in the British Isles, and alongside hurling it is the oldest sport indigenous to Cornwall.
The objective of Cornish wrasslin is to throw the challenger from a standing position, with no grappling or holding on the ground. A bout begins when the competitors grab each other’s jackets by the collar, lapel or sleeve, in what is known as a hitch. To win the bout, ​the competitor must score a back. A back is scored by throwing the opponent on his or her hips or shoulders. There are four pins on the back of the jacket, and three have to touch the ground to score a back and win the contest. A single pin touching the ground only counts as one point but can be accumulated and scored at the end.
There are many different techniques and throws to defeat an opponent and score a back. Crooks and heaves are the most popular. Crooks are a variation of a trip, to catch an opponent off guard, while heaves are used by heavier, more powerful wrasslers to lift their opponent in the air and fling them on their back.
The wearing of canvas jackets is essential and makes gripping easier, and competitors also wear shorts and socks. One crucial thing to keep in mind is that strength is not the main contributing factor to wrasslin. Many techniques and moves can be deployed to get a back. In fact, competitors from Devon are said to have used more kicking, which has not always gone down particularly well with the Cornish.
One of the most famous encounters between wrasslers from Devon and Cornwall must surely be the great wrasslin bout of 1826. Any match between Devon and Cornwall was almost always hotly disputed and always bore a pridely grudge, and this was no exception. James Polkinghorne was due to meet Abraham Cann. James Polkinghorne was born in the St Keverne and was usually associate with St Columb, for it was here that he was the landlord of the Red Lion inn. He set forth to uphold the honour of Cornish wrasslin when he took on Cann the challenger.
The match was to find the champion of the west of England and it took place at Tamar Green in Devonport on 23 October 1826. The ultimate result has never been agreed and it remains a matter of controversy to this day. It was from St Stephens that James Polkinghorne set off, in his gig rowing boat, on a long trip with his brother to Tamar Green. Information about the controversy surrounding the event from the outset can be found in an article on the heyday and decline of wrasslin. In 1960, the late Leslie Jolly, a recognised authority on wrasslin, wrote in a Cornish gazette that he wondered whether Polkinghorne was the right person to take on the challenger Cann. Jolly’s grandfather, of Penscowen, St Enoder, was a renowned wrassler during the early part of the 19th century, and he made the case that Parkyn of St Columb Minor would have been a better representative. Parkyn had been champion for 20 years, but he was 52 and Polkinghorne a mere 38. Parkyn’s claims were supported by some involved in the sport, including in St Columb, but nevertheless it was Polkinghorne who eventually went across the Tamar.
Cornish wrasslin has not always had a good name. Before the sport’s governing body was founded, there were all sorts of things going on in Cornwall. The attraction of wrasslin brought about a bout in Bodmin. One of the competitors entered the ring and threw two roach men. That success was immediately followed by an attack by the Bodmin men, which led to a general riot. The contenders congested in a pugilistic style, the combatants armed themselves with bludgeons from the wooden rickshaw in the church town, and a fight ensued. Heads were laid open, teeth knocked out and the battlefield was quickly strewn with the maimed.​
During the 1930s and 1940s, several members of the Chapman family achieved great wrasslin success. Grandfathers, fathers and sons all fought. Many Cornish towns and villages held tournaments, and hundreds would turn up to watch the contests. The Hawkeys and the Warnes were also well-known wrassling families, but the most famous competitor of the day was the heavyweight champion, Francis Gregory of St Wenn.
Gregory had his first match when he was 13 and he was the youngest Cornishman to show his skills at the London Palladium in 1927. He represented Cornwall seven times from 1928 at the official Cornu-Breton championships. He won seven times, on four occasions in Brittany. Later, he moved north and changed his sport to play rugby league for Wigan and Warrington and was capped for England. Taking up professional wrestling, he became known as Francis St Clair Gregory, and in November 1955 he made his first appearance in a wrestling match shown on British television.
More recently, in the face of fierce competition and promotion, Cornish wrestling waned to a small group of stalwarts. To put a stop to the decline and help raise awareness, in 2004, the Cornish Wrestling Association became affiliated with the British Wrestling Association. Publicity increased and training sessions took place in Helston, Truro and Wadebridge. Those measures have helped wrasslin make a strong comeback. Based at St Columb Major, today Ashley Cawley is the current Cornish heavyweight champion. He is also the Cornish Wrestling Association’s public relations officer, while his uncle, Mike Cawley, is the association chairman. Ashley’s father, Gerry, came out of wrestling retirement and won two championships recently.
Over the summer months, the Cornish Wrestling Association runs tournaments in villages and towns across the duchy. They also feature at the Royal Cornwall Show. All ages are welcome to participate and there are several children’s categories. There is now a plaque in St Columb Major to commemorate the fight between Polkinghorne and Cann. The contests are overseen by three referees called sticklers, who award the points.
It is thought that Cornish wrasslin evolved the way it did because it is safer for wrestlers to land on their backs. The wrestlers are taught to grip tight and to avoid putting their arms down to soften the blow.
Wrestlers swear an oath in Cornish before wrasslin. The translation is:
“On my honour and the honour of my country”—
I think they probably mean Cornwall there—
“I swear to wrestle without treachery or brutality and in token of my sincerity, I offer my hand to my opponent.”
I will give the Cornish a go:
“Gwary whec yu gwary tek”,
which means, “Good play is fair play”.
Thirdly, the Commonwealth games are taking place in Birmingham, and there has been Greco-Roman wrestling in previous Commonwealth games. We have a chance to showcase all that is great about the British Isles. Will the Minister therefore help me to lobby the Commonwealth games committee either to put Cornish wrasslin in future Commonwealth games or to allow our fantastic sportsmen and women who do Cornish wrasslin to have a spot at the opening ceremony to demonstrate how good the sport is?
I hope that I have provided some entertainment in talking about a sport that I care passionately about. I hope that the debate has showcased Cornish wrasslin.

Thank you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Attends a Pacific Command Briefing,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-pacific-command-hawaii-november-3-2017
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-08-24,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Senator, Governor and Rudy, thank you very much.
Wow, what a group! What a group!
Very excited, very, very excited to be with you tonight. Thank you very much.
The people of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have such incredible energy, that very powerful word energy
And thank you for all the support you've given me right from the beginning. I will not forget it, Mississippi. We love Mississippi right from the beginning, right from the beginning.
This is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent.
And this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new American future.
To everyone watching across our nation right now, to everyone who has been let down by our terrible, terrible politicians, I am asking for your vote on November 8th.
This is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of, by and for the people.
No one will be left behind anymore.
I'd like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan. They are going through a lot.
We must defeat radical Islamic terrorism.
Anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country.
Eight years of Obama/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence. Our jobs have moved to other countries. Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores. And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened, and I mean totally threatened, our security.
The issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union. This is the movement known as Brexit.
On June 23rd, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence, which is what we're looking to do also, folks...
... from their international government which hasn't worked. They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders.
They voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government.
Working people and the great people of the U.K. took control of their destiny.
The people profiting from the rigged system, and it is rigged, we're finding it out every single day, the multinational banks, the media celebrities, the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change. The same thing is happening right here in the United States. It's happening.
All the people benefiting from our rigged system don't want things to change. They want you to believe things can't be changed.
And they can so easily, so easily and so smartly.
And we all know things have to change. We have no choice. And they have to change right now.
Before the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it. People said, what does he know, what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th.
Hillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks.
She got this one wrong, too.
She got this one wrong, too, folks. She got this one wrong, too. She gets them all wrong. She gets them all wrong, doesn't she? She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you.
And now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want.
She wants a country without borders. She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations. She wants a government that ignores the will of the people.
She wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash.
It's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.
According to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors.
Hillary Clinton does not believe in America first. We believe in America first.
Hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists. She will never straighten out our country. She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country. We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want.
She would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic.
The job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States...
... not illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that.
My focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country.
I will fight for their security. I will fight for their jobs. We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries. We will not let it happen anymore.
We'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you. It ends. What's been going on ends on November 8th.
We will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together. Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people. November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence.
This is a great honor for me. I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nigel Farage.
Wow! Thank you, Nigel.
What a job! What a job he did. What a job he did against all odds.
Thank you, Nigel.
That was some job that he did against all odds. Everybody said it couldn't be done. And by the way, it's looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters, so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here. Thank you.
And if I may, we had some tremendous polls come out today. I won't bring it up, I refuse to mention it, but they were very good. We're leading in a lot of locations.
Thank you.
It's time for America to recapture, like you just heard, to recapture our destiny. Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people. They have, they have totally lost touch.
You need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law. We can't allow that.
Why do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally, they're here illegally, and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them, but they don't try helping American citizens, some of whom have been devastated by what's happened to their children and their families? Devastated.
My priorities will never change: jobs, wages and security for Americans.
And the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests. First, it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens.
We have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago, were not working as hard as they're working now and they've gotten older, not supposed to be that way, and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as Obamacare"" they have to hold two jobs
Not going to happen, folks, not going to happen.
Second, it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens.
Third, it must improve the quality of life for U.S. citizens. The quality of life, our quality of life is going down.
Our level of security, you look back years, you're more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10, 15 and 20 years ago.
Hillary Clinton's radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very, very badly. Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents.
Her support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has, just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent, magnificent Sarah Root.
Yesterday I met with her mom, Michelle. Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally. I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports.
Where is the sanctuary for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans.
Hillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term...
... a large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized, which will weaken our tolerant way of life.
I only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America.
Importantly, I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people.
We are going to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fix our trade deals, unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as Obamacare.
We are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs.
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me.
So we're going to have millions and millions of jobs, jobs like you have never seen in this country before, because our jobs are being stolen from us, our companies are being stolen from us, our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes. Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, believe me.
Rising incomes, higher wages, thousands of new companies all across this nation, they'll come in and they'll form. We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made, not only in this country, but anywhere in the world, known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton.
We're going to stand up to China on trade. We're going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP.
It will not happen with me. It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary, believe me.
This state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and it's lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization, both deals supported by Hillary Clinton. Horrible deals, destructive deals, what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country.
We are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi...
... and in North Carolina, which has treated me so well, and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places, and to Pennsylvania, where I went to school, and to Maryland and all across this land. We're going to bring our jobs back and we're not going to let our jobs be taken away.
Thank you. Thank you.
And I'm going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity, safety and prosperity to our very, very troubled inner cities.
The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.
Democratic crime policies, education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes and more poverty than we've ever had in those communities before.
Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone.
Violent crime has risen 17 percent, and in America's 50 largest cities it's only going one way, folks, and that's up. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore.
The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted, and they've done nothing in return.
They've just assumed they'll get your support and they've done nothing, absolutely nothing to deserve it.
It's time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes.
It's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly. It's time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system. And I was the first to use that term, it's a rigged, disgusting system.
To those hurting and suffering and left behind, I say, what do you have to lose by trying something new? What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president? What do you have to lose? I will fix the problem. I will fix the problem.
If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results.
But I also want to talk about what you have to gain, right? Right? What do you have to gain? We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive.
What else will we gain? We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need.
We will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that.
We will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before.
We will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs. And we will rebuild the roads, the bridges, the infrastructure, the tunnels, the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies, with our steel and with our labor.
Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color...
... only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She's going to do nothing for African Americans. She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She's only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about. She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities. She doesn't care.
Remember this. You've had her policies, Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50, 70, 80, even over a hundred years. And look what you have right now, poverty, no education, crime, you can't walk down the street with your child. We're going to fix it, we're going to fix it.
Hillary Clinton has no remorse. I will fight to create a better future for every American. The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda.
Of course, if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that.
They're going to have to start studying those polls. That's why you need to come out and you have to vote, you have to vote.
That is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th, have to do it.
Another crucial issue in this race is national security. Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office.
Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama/Clinton administration, that I call a catastrophe, took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, would never have happened. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.
Fast forward to today. After spending $4 trillion, maybe $5 trillion, nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country, what have the decisions of Obama/Clinton produced?
Libya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations, they're all over the world. Syria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of the territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country. And we don't know who they are, where they come from. We know nothing. Iraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West. At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely, folks, definitely, I've been very good at predicting, definitely into the United States.
Iran has become the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States, plus another $400 million in cash, cash, cash ransom...
... that President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom, had nothing to do with the hostages, and his own people said he was wrong.
He lied. He lied. Just like he said Obamacare, keep your plan
Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants, constantly chants death to America"" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. And we put them there over the last three years.
This is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.
But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. We're going to end the era of nation-building, a disastrous concept, a disastrous era, and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS. We have no choice destroying ISIS.
We will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.
I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people, our citizens, trying to hurt the world, but trying to hurt the United States: We will find you, we will destroy you and we will win.
Thank you. Thank you.
This is not only a military fight, but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare. It's also an ideological fight. We will confront directly the hateful, it's just so hateful, ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and America's system of government.
Only by standing up for and supporting, we have to stand up for and support, our values can we become a united country once again...
... a country of great jobs and wealth, a country of security and freedom, a country of strength and unity. The future is limitless. All we have to do is believe in America once again. We have to believe it can happen. It can happen.
We will put back our faith in America's special destiny. We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by what's happening in our government. We'll create a level playing field for American workers. We'll never ever let what's happened to them happen to them again. We'll establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land.
I am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country, African American, Hispanic, all Americans, all Americans who want a better, brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country.
I am the change candidate. This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion.
And I won't be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods.
I'm going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children. And to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and we will win for you, we will win.
Together we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, we will make America great again.
Thank you and God bless you. Thank you, Mississippi. We love Mississippi. God bless you. Thank you.

Ulysses S. Grant,United States of America,1870-06-13 00:00:00,"To the Senate and House of Representatives:
In my annual message to Congress at the beginning of its present session I referred to the contest which had then for more than a year existed in the island of Cuba between a portion of its inhabitants and the Government of Spain, and the feelings and sympathies of the people and Government of the United States for the people of Cuba, as for all peoples struggling for liberty and self-government, and said that ""the contest has at no time assumed the conditions which amount to war in the sense of international law, or which would show the existence of a de facto political organization of the insurgents sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency.""
During the six months which have passed since the date of that message the condition of the insurgents has not improved, and the insurrection itself, although not subdued, exhibits no signs of advance, but seems to be confined to an irregular system of hostilities, carried on by small and illy armed bands of men, roaming without concentration through the woods and the sparsely populated regions of the island, attacking from ambush convoys and small bands of troops, burning plantations and the estates of those not sympathizing with their cause.
But if the insurrection has not gained ground, it is equally true that Spain has not suppressed it. Climate, disease, and the occasional bullet have worked destruction among the soldiers of Spain; and although the Spanish authorities have possession of every seaport and every town on the island, they have not been able to subdue the hostile feeling which has driven a considerable number of the native inhabitants of the island to armed resistance against Spain, and still leads them to endure the dangers and the privations of a roaming life of guerrilla warfare.
On either side the contest has been conducted, and is still carried on, with a lamentable disregard of human life and of the rules and practices which modern civilization has prescribed in mitigation of the necessary horrors of war. The torch of Spaniard and of Cuban is alike busy in carrying devastation over fertile regions; murderous and revengeful decrees are issued and executed by both parties. Count Valmaseda and Colonel Boet, on the part of Spain, have each startled humanity and aroused the indignation of the civilized world by the execution, each, of a score of prisoners at a time, while General Quesada, the Cuban chief, coolly and with apparent unconsciousness of aught else than a proper act, has admitted the slaughter, by his own deliberate order, in one day, of upward of 650 prisoners of war.
A summary trial, with few, if any, escapes from conviction, followed by immediate execution, is the fate of those arrested on either side on suspicion of infidelity to the cause of the party making the arrest.
Whatever may be the sympathies of the people or of the Government of the United States for the cause or objects for which a part of the people of Cuba are understood to have put themselves in armed resistance to the Government of Spain, there can be no just sympathy in a conflict carried on by both parties alike in such barbarous violation of the rules of civilized nations and with such continued outrage upon the plainest principles of humanity.
We can not discriminate in our censure of their mode of conducting their contest between the Spaniards and the Cubans. Each commit the same atrocities and outrage alike the established rules of war.
The properties of many of our citizens have been destroyed or embargoed, the lives of several have been sacrificed, and the liberty of others has been restrained. In every case that has come to the knowledge of the Government an early and earnest demand for reparation and indemnity has been made, and most emphatic remonstrance has been presented against the manner in which the strife is conducted and against the reckless disregard of human life, the wanton destruction of material wealth, and the cruel disregard of the established rules of civilized warfare.
I have, since the beginning of the present session of Congress, communicated to the House of Representatives, upon their request, an account of the steps which I had taken in the hope of bringing this sad conflict to an end and of securing to the people of Cuba the blessings and the right of independent self-government. The efforts thus made failed, but not without an assurance from Spain that the good offices of this Government might still avail for the objects to which they had been addressed.
During the whole contest the remarkable exhibition has been made of large numbers of Cubans escaping from the island and avoiding the risks of war; congregating in this country, at a safe distance from the scene of danger, and endeavoring to make war from our shores, to urge our people into the fight which they avoid, and to embroil this Government in complications and possible hostilities with Spain. It can scarce be doubted that this last result is the real object of these parties, although carefully covered under the deceptive and apparently plausible demand for a mere recognition of belligerency.
It is stated on what I have reason to regard as good authority that Cuban bonds have been prepared to a large amount, whose payment is made dependent upon the recognition by the United States of either Cuban belligerency or independence. The object of making their value thus contingent upon the action of this Government is a subject for serious reflection.
In determining the course to be adopted on the demand thus made for a recognition of belligerency the liberal and peaceful principles adopted by the Father of his Country and the eminent statesmen of his day, and followed by succeeding Chief Magistrates and the men of their day, may furnish a safe guide to those of us now charged with the direction and control of the public safety.
From 1789 to 1815 the dominant thought of our statesmen was to keep the United States out of the wars which were devastating Europe. The discussion of measures of neutrality begins with the State papers of Mr. Jefferson when Secretary of State. He shows that they are measures of national right as well as of national duty; that misguided individual citizens can not be tolerated in making war according to their own caprice, passions, interests, or foreign sympathies; that the agents of foreign governments, recognized or unrecognized, can not be permitted to abuse our hospitality by usurping the functions of enlisting or equipping military or naval forces within our territory. Washington inaugurated the policy of neutrality and of absolute abstinence from all foreign entangling alliances, which resulted, in 1794, in the first municipal enactment for the observance of neutrality.
The duty of opposition to filibustering has been admitted by every President. Washington encountered the efforts of Genet and of the French revolutionists; John Adams, the projects of Miranda; Jefferson, the schemes of Aaron Burr. Madison and subsequent Presidents had to deal with the question of foreign enlistment or equipment in the United States, and since the days of John Quincy Adams it has been one of the constant cares of Government in the United States to prevent piratical expeditions against the feeble Spanish American Republics from leaving our shores. In no country are men wanting for any enterprise that holds out promise of adventure or of gain.
In the early days of our national existence the whole continent of America (outside of the limits of the United States) and all its islands were in colonial dependence upon European powers.
The revolutions which from 1810 spread almost simultaneously through all the Spanish American continental colonies resulted in the establishment of new States, like ourselves, of European origin, and interested in excluding European politics and the questions of dynasty and of balances of power from further influence in the New World.
The American policy of neutrality, important before, became doubly so from the fact that it became applicable to the new Republics as well as to the mother country.
It then devolved upon us to determine the great international question at what time and under what circumstances to recognize a new power as entitled to a place among the family of nations, as well as the preliminary question of the attitude to be observed by this Government toward the insurrectionary party pending the contest.
Mr. Monroe concisely expressed the rule which has controlled the action of this Government with reference to revolting colonies pending their struggle by saying:
As soon as the movement assumed such a steady and consistent form as to make the success of the Provinces probable, the rights to which they were entitled by the laws of nations as equal parties to a civil war were extended to them.
The strict adherence to this rule of public policy has been one of the highest honors of American statesmanship, and has secured to this Government the confidence of the feeble powers on this continent, which induces them to rely upon its friendship and absence of designs of conquest and to look to the United States for example and moral protection. It has given to this Government a position of prominence and of influence which it should not abdicate, but which imposes upon it the most delicate duties of right and of honor regarding American questions, whether those questions affect emancipated colonies or colonies still subject to European dominion.
The question of belligerency is one of fact, not to be decided by sympathies for or prejudices against either party. The relations between the parent state and the insurgents must amount in fact to war in the sense of international law. Fighting, though fierce and protracted, does not alone constitute war. There must be military forces acting in accordance with the rules and customs of war, flags of truce, cartels, exchange of prisoners, etc.; and to justify a recognition of belligerency there must be, above all, a de facto political organization of the insurgents sufficient in character and resources to constitute it, if left to itself, a state among nations capable of discharging the duties of a state and of meeting the just responsibilities it may incur as such toward other powers in the discharge of its national duties.
Applying the best information which I have been enabled to gather, whether from official or unofficial sources, including the very exaggerated statements which each party gives to all that may prejudice the opposite or give credit to its own side of the question, I am unable to see in the present condition of the contest in Cuba those elements which are requisite to constitute war in the sense of international law.
The insurgents hold no town or city; have no established seat of government; they have no prize courts; no organization for the receiving and collecting of revenue; no seaport to which a prize may be carried or through which access can be had by a foreign power to the limited interior territory and mountain fastnesses which they occupy. The existence of a legislature representing any popular constituency is more than doubtful.
In the uncertainty that hangs around the entire insurrection there is no palpable evidence of an election, of any delegated authority, or of any government outside the limits of the camps occupied from day to day by the roving companies of insurgent troops; there is no commerce, no trade, either internal or foreign, no manufactures.
The late commander in chief of the insurgents, having recently come to the United States, publicly declared that ""all commercial intercourse or trade with the exterior world has been utterly cut off;"" and he further added: ""Today we have not 10,000 arms in Cuba.""
It is a well-established principle of public law that a recognition by a foreign state of belligerent rights to insurgents under circumstances such as now exist in Cuba, if not justified by necessity, is a gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion. Such necessity may yet hereafter arrive, but it has not yet arrived, nor is its probability clearly to be seen.
If it be war between Spain and Cuba, and be so recognized, it is our duty to provide for the consequences which may ensue in the embarrassment to our commerce and the interference with our revenue.
If belligerency be recognized, the commercial marine of the United States becomes liable to search and to seizure by the commissioned cruisers of both parties; they become subject to the adjudication of prize courts.
Our large coastwise trade between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and between both and the Isthmus of Panama and the States of South America (engaging the larger part of our commercial marine) passes of necessity almost in sight of the island of Cuba. Under the treaty with Spain of 1795, as well as by the law of nations, our vessels will be liable to visit on the high seas. In case of belligerency the carrying of contraband, which now is lawful, becomes liable to the risks of seizure and condemnation. The parent Government becomes relieved from responsibility for acts done in the insurgent territory, and acquires the right to exercise against neutral commerce all the powers of a party to a maritime war. To what consequences the exercise of those powers may lead is a question which I desire to commend to the serious consideration of Congress.
In view of the gravity of this question, I have deemed it my duty to invite the attention of the war-making power of the country to all the relations and bearings of the question in connection with the declaration of neutrality and granting of belligerent rights.
There is not a de facto government in the island of Cuba sufficient to execute law and maintain just relations with other nations. Spain has not been able to suppress the opposition to Spanish rule on the island, nor to award speedy justice to other nations, or citizens of other nations, when their rights have been invaded.
There are serious complications growing out of the seizure of American vessels upon the high seas, executing American citizens without proper trial, and confiscating or embargoing the property of American citizens. Solemn protests have been made against every infraction of the rights either of individual citizens of the United States or the rights of our flag upon the high seas, and all proper steps have been taken and are being pressed for the proper reparation of every indignity complained of.
The question of belligerency, however, which is to be decided upon definite principles and according to ascertained facts, is entirely different from and unconnected with the other questions of the manner in which the strife is carried on both sides and the treatment of our citizens entitled to our protection.
The questions concern our own dignity and responsibility, and they have been made, as I have said, the subjects of repeated communications with Spain and of protests and demands for redress on our part. It is hoped that these will not be disregarded, but should they be these questions will be made the subject of a further communication to Congress.

Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2007-03-10,"America's middle class, and working families, have become the invisible Americans.
If you are a hard working single parent who can't afford health insurance or a small business owner who worries about energy costs or a student who can't afford to continue college, you are invisible to this Administration. You are invisible to the oil companies earning record profits while you pay more at the pump. You are invisible to the companies who outsource your job, or lay you off or end the promise of your pension. For six long years, President Bush and the Washington Republicans have looked right through you.
If you are a first responder, worker or volunteer from 9/11 in need of medical treatment, you are invisible to them.
If you are a soldier returning from combat and waiting for treatment or disability pay, you are invisible.
If you are a child sitting in a failing school waiting for the promised federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act, you are invisible.
If you are single mom who needs safe quality child care while you go to work, you are invisible.
And if you're a career government scientist raising the global warming alarm; a conservationist trying to protect the environment; a government accountant looking into no bid contracts that have cost the tax payers billions of dollars; even a Republican U.S. Attorney trying to enforce the law impartially - they've tried to make you invisible to the rest of us.
More than 46 million people living without health insurance. More than 90,000 people living in trailers after Hurricane Katrina. 13 million children living in poverty.
For six long years, they have all been invisible.
Well, they're not invisible to us. They're not invisible to me. And when we retake the White House, they will no longer be invisible to the President of the United States.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-04-28,"Well, thank you very much everyone. This is a great honor and I see you have social distance on your mind and that’s a very good thing. Jovita, congratulations. Tremendous job you’re doing. I want to thank everyone for being at the White House, a very special house, a very special place, no matter where you go in the world, they love the White House. And being here, the East Room of the White House in particular where so many important functions have taken place over the years. And today were really celebrating American workers and small businesses and we’ve done a job for you and we’re going to make it so as we open up our country, you’re going to be in good shape as opposed to be either losing your business or how do we get some people to work here, especially since your employees was so good over the years and those are the ones you wanted. So we made that possible for you. We’re delighted to be joined this afternoon by representatives of several incredible small businesses from across our country, also with us, our Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Steve, thank you very much.
And the SBA administrator, you’ve been… you’ve been busy, Steve, by the way? A little bit. Broke every record in the book and SBA administrator Jovita Carranza. Thank you, Jovita. Have you gone to sleep the last two weeks? I don’t think so. You broke every single lending record. Numbers of loans, amount of loans, small business, it’s actually a very big business when you think about it. Thank you very much, Jovita. Great job. As our nation battles against this terrible scourge, we continue to pray for the victims as well as for those Americans who are grieving their lost ones and their loved ones. There’s never been anything like this. We suffer with one heart, but we will prevail. We’re coming back and we’re coming back strong. And we built the greatest economy anywhere in the world two months ago and we’re going to build it again. We’re going to build it fast. It’s going to go very quickly, and Larry, thank you for being here very much. You see what’s going to happen. I think you have the same feeling as I do. It’s going to come back very fast.
Now that our experts believe the worst days of the pandemic are behind us, Americans are looking forward to the safe and rapid reopening of our country. Throughout this ordeal, millions of hardworking Americans have been asked to really make tremendous, tremendous sacrifices. It’s sacrifices like nobody thought would even be possible. Nobody thought would ever be talking about something like this. This virus has inflicted an enormous and painful toll on our nation’s workers and small businesses. That’s why last month I asked Congress to pass the Paycheck Protection Program, giving small businesses emergency economic relief to keep workers on the payroll. Four weeks ago I was proud to sign it into law. We did that at a great ceremony with many of the people here and the officials here and it was something. And I can tell you, I’m going to ask Steve to say a few words, but the kind of numbers and the kind of jobs they’ve done and the kind of jobs that have also been saved. It’s incredible. You’ll be seeing that in the coming weeks.
The Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration launched the program in record breaking time, just one week. And in the 14 days following its launch, we processed as many loans as the SBA would typically process in over 14 years. So in 14 days they did more work and more loans, both in terms of applications and in terms of a dollar amount, than they did in 14 years. 14 days, 14 years, easy one to remember. That’s some record. The first round of funding provided more than 1.6 million small businesses with over $340 billion so that American workers can retain their jobs, receive their paychecks, and help our economy take off quickly, once America reopens for business. Which is happening right now as we sit, we’re going to be all set and you all ready? I know you are. I talked to you back there, you’re ready. You folks are ready.
Our swift action supported or saved 30 million American jobs at least. And last week, Congress answered our call to replenish the program and I was honored to sign an additional $ 320 billion for American workers into law. At least $60 billion are reserved for community financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities. And that’s also when you think it’s African American communities, it’s Hispanic American communities, Asian American communities. We began accepting applications for the second round of funding yesterday. Demand is extraordinarily high and there are already twice as many users accessing the system as on any day under the first round. And one of the things that the Secretary of the Treasury told me is that the amounts are much more loans at much smaller amounts. So we like to hear that because we’re looking at the small amounts, the smaller businesses and that’s what we want.
Nonetheless, we’re processing loans at a pace never achieved before. In the first 24 hours of the second round of funding, we’ve handled over 30% more loans than any previous day of the program. So far, we’ve processed an amazing 450,000 loans totaling over $50 billion. That’s in phase two. That’s incredible. Along with Administrator Carranza and Secretary Mnuchin, Ivanka has played an essential role in spearheading this important program. Incredible girl. That’s what she wants to do. She wants to help people. From the beginning of my administration, Ivanka has used her experience as an entrepreneur to fight for the American worker. She’s created many jobs. That’s what she did when she first came in. She just wanted people to be able to get jobs and job training. Went to the biggest companies anywhere in the world that are located in our country and they would take hundreds of thousands of people and train them and I think you got up to almost 15 million people. 15 million. She started off with a goal of 500,000 she wanted to get 500,000 and she is now on almost 15 million people. And I’d like to ask if I might, Ivanka to say a few words as to what’s exactly happening today, what’s what’s happening over the next week. And what her views are for what’s going to happen over the next period of time. It’s going to be something, I think it’s going to be very special and bigger and better than anybody really understands. Let’s see if I’m right about that. Ivanka, please.
Thank you very much Michael.
That’s better than we did. Much better, Michael, you did a better job. Thank you very much. That’s beautiful. Stick around. You’ll get hear the press, ask some questions and they’ll probably be a little bit nicer if you’re in the audience. Right, Amy? That’s pretty good. Also, I’d like to ask Tony Stafford, chief, very sort of the boss, I guess you could say, chef and founder. You’re the boss, right? Wouldn’t you say? Of Ford’s Fish Shack. And I hear it’s good stuff. How about explaining, please. Be careful. Thank you. Come on up, please.
Fantastic, thank you.
Is he a great chef or a good chef?
That’s a great story, your mother lives with you, five children, that’s a great story. So that was a rough day, right? Wasn’t it, huh? Never happened to you before probably. Yeah, it happened to a lot of people it never happened before so … but we’re bringing it all back. There are been a couple of places that have opened and I don’t know if you saw this, Tony, they have some restaurants and they have lines that are very long to get in. People want to be back, they want to come back. We’re going to bring our country back. They want to get to work. And I know you were in that category very much, so it’s great. Thank you fellas very much. Jackie Krick CEO and founder of ECU communications. Jackie, please.
I’ll get in trouble for touching it. They’ll say he touched the microphone. What am I going to do?
Great job.
Thank you Jackie, great job. Chris Stansbury, co-founder and partner, West Virginia Eye Consultants. I like West Virginia. I like it. I’ll put that up.
That’s fantastic. So you do eye examinations, Doctor?
And you do a glasses and all that? I may have to see you. Okay, I guarantee you’re probably better than these high priced people. I used to see the highest priced and they were not the best. I bet you’re better than all of them so I may have to see you, Doctor. I’m serious about it. We can do something quickly, all right, you move quickly too, right? No long meetings? Good. I may have to see you, Doctor, thank you. Tisa Clark, president and CEO, J.D. Clark Professional Services, J.D. Clark. Hi, come on up, please.
Have you ever thought about running for office? You could do it very easily. Thank you very much. Luke Bernstein, executive vice president, chief retail officer and chief communications officer for Orrstown Bank. Come on up, Luke.
Thank you very much, Luke, that’s a beautiful job. Brandon Hutson, president Ed &amp; Jim’s Body Shop. I know what that means. I’ll bet you’ve fixed beautiful cars, you make them beautiful, right? I bet you do. Please come up.
Thank you. And what do you do with cars, explain?
Can you generally fix like when there’s a problem with a car, can you generally fix it without sending for new pieces or do you generally have to put new pieces on, if it’s a big collision?
After today you’ll have a lot of customers.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Brandon. Thank you, Brandon. Ali Mills, executive vice president, Plum Contracting Inc. Come on up here. He was so good.
Thank you.
I was with governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, which is interesting from your standpoint, because we talked about the business that you’re in. And he noticed that right into the immediate shutdown, he noticed there was very few cars on the road. And he did very opposite of what a lot of governors did. He said, “This is a great time to fix our roads and highways.” And I said, as soon as he said it, this was in the Oval Office two hours ago. He said, “I noticed there was very few cars and isn’t that better than fixing them during rush hours, and when there’s traffic, and one it’s booming?” Like hopefully over the next few months it’s going to be again, just like it was before, the best we’ve ever had. And then we had to close it down. So he’s fixing roads, and bridges and doing a tremendous amount of work during this period of time.
And I thought it was very smart. So it’s a little bit the opposite, but to each his own, right? To each his own. But it made a lot of sense to me when I heard it. I’d like to ask Secretary Mnuchin to come up and explain just a little bit about how well it’s going. The kind of numbers, the kind of records, to a point where there’s never been anything like this. Loans coming in, and how the loans are actually smaller than in phase one. And that makes us happy, because that means smaller businesses and that’s what we’re looking at. That’s what we’re aiming at this time. Please, Steve.
Thank you very much, Steve. Thank you. And Steve, on the enhanced payments. We’re really looking to the state to give that out. And unfortunately, some of the states have very old computerized equipment from many generations ago. But, they have the money to give out and they’ll give it out as it comes. And hopefully they’ll be able to do the job. Some states have been very efficient and others have had a hard time. But you’ll work with the ones that have had a hard time. But we relied on the states, and we are relying on the states to get it out as quickly as they can. Considering, especially some of the equipment they have.
Maybe now they’ll be able to buy new equipment, right? When we get all finished, we’ll have nice new computerized equipment so they can do it. With that, if you’d like to ask a few questions, I think this would be a good time. Because with these incredible people, this is the media, you’ve heard me talking about it on occasion. Seldom, right? But on occasion. And I think with you in the room, I have a feeling that they’ll ask me much nicer questions. They’ll tone them down, right? And thank you for the apology. I appreciate it. That was very nice. Yahoo, I appreciate it. That was very nice. Yeah. Go ahead, Jim. Go ahead.
Well, it will go down to zero, ultimately. And you have to understand when it comes to cases, we do much more testing than anybody else. So we could go to some of these other countries, as an example, China. If you test, you’re going to show many more cases. So we’re testing. We’re doing more testing than any other country in the world by far, which we just discussed over in the Oval Office. So we’re going to show more cases because we’re doing much, much more testing. Double anybody else. Somebody said if you add everybody else combined, that would be a number. And it will be at the appropriate time, it will be down to zero. Like we said.
Yeah.
Right. Also experts, many very good experts, very good people too, said that this would never affect the United States. It wouldn’t affect Europe, it wouldn’t affect anything outside of China. So we were listening to experts, and we always will listen to experts. But, the experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong. And a lot of people had no idea it would be this serious. I listened to experts. I’ll tell you what, I did something that the experts thought I shouldn’t have done. I closed down our country and our borders. I did a ban on China from coming in, other than US citizens, and we did very strong checks on even our US citizens.
Ron DeSantis was telling me before that when they came in, people were put into quarantine. People were checked, and we’re doing that now. So yeah, I think we did something well ahead of schedule. And we did that at the end of January. People were talking about this wouldn’t have an impact, as you know, even into March. So I think we’ve done a great job in the sense that we were early. I think by banning China, by banning China and banning people coming in who would have been very heavily infected, we probably saved hundreds of thousands of lives. So on that, I’m very proud. Yeah, please.
Well, I like the idea of the payroll tax cuts. I’ve liked that from the beginning. That was the thing that I really would love to see happen. A lot of economists would agree with me. A lot of people agree with me. And I think, frankly it’s simple. It’s not the big distribution, and it would really be an incentive for people to come back to work and for employers to hire. The double tax on the company and also on the person. That’s what I like. And something like that could happen. Also, I think you have to look, because a lot of people are talking to, I assume your next question would be about states. And Steve and I talk about it, and I talk about it with Mitch, and with Kevin, and with everybody. And the problem with the states is we’re not looking to recover 25 years of bad management and to give them the money that they lost.
That’s unfair to other states. Now, if it’s COVID related, I guess we can talk about it. But, we’d want certain things also, including sanctuary city adjustments, because we have so many people in sanctuary cities. Which I don’t even think are popular even by radical left folks. Because what’s happening is people are being protected that shouldn’t be protected. A lot of bad things are happening with sanctuary cities. But, that’s just standing up here answering this question. That’s one of the things I think about. If we’re going to do something for the states, I think they’d probably want something having to do with sanctuary cities, something having to do with other different points that we can discuss a little bit later on. Yeah. Jeff, go ahead, please.
Well, we haven’t been talked about, it hasn’t been asked on other industries yet. But with the meat packing and with the transportation, we have had some difficulty where they’re having a liability that’s really unfair to them. And we’re going to be doing that, I think Mark, we’re going to be doing that fairly soon. It’s getting drawn up. I should be signing that over the next hour or so. Taking the liability, which frees up the entire system. And I fully understand it. Not their fault. Yeah. Please, go ahead.
No. Over here first.
Yeah. We’re looking at doing it on the international flights coming out of areas that are heavily infected. As you know, Brazil is getting to that category. I think they’re going to be okay. I hope they’re going to be okay. He’s a very good friend of mine, the President. But, I think that we’re going to look at it from the standpoint, I was discussing that with the governor of Florida, with Ron a little while ago. So we’re going to be looking at that coming in from other countries, frankly. But, South America seems to be one that’s talked about because they have so much business going into Florida. With all of that being said, Florida’s done incredibly well. And they’re starting to open up, and open up very rapidly. But we will be looking into that in the very near future. We’re looking at it very strongly.
Either the airlines or government. One or the other. We’re working with the airlines. Maybe it’s a combination of both. Kristen, go ahead.
Well, it will increase it, and it’ll increase it by much more than that in the very near future. We’re way ahead of everyone on testing. We haven’t been given the press in terms of, I think fairness of the press, but that’s okay. And that’s why I appreciated the statement before by Yahoo. We are way ahead on testing. We are the best in the world on testing. We’ve tested much more than anybody else, times two. Or every country combined, we’ve tested more than every country combined. And they keep talking about South Korea. And I’m very friendly, as you know, with President Moon, who just had a great victory. A new victory, as we’re very about. But he will tell you how well the United States has done on testing. And he told me that very strongly. The quality of our test is the best and the number is the best.
Now, with all of that being said, we will be going to an even higher number. And it goes up exponentially. And I’ve told you that we inherited a very broken test, a broken system, and a broken test. And within a short period of time we were setting records. So we have set records, we’ve done more than the entire world combined. We’ve done more than any other country in the world. So I think we’ve done a really good job. Now, with that being said, not everybody feels as strongly about testing as others. We have some governors that are very strong on testing. We have other governors, frankly, that aren’t nearly as strong on testing. Their test is much more modest, and their real test is when people stop getting sick and they’ll be able to do that too. And I understand both systems very well. But we’re going to maximum testing, even though some people won’t even want to use it.
Well, we’re going to be there very soon. If you look at the numbers, it could be that we’re getting very close. I mean, I don’t have the exact numbers. We would have had them if you asked me the same question a little while ago, because people with the statistics were there. We’re going to be there very soon. I mean, I watched your report on NBC today, and it was an incorrect report. Because we’re really doing a great job on testing. Unfortunately, the administration, the people that work our government hasn’t been given the kind of credit that it deserves. Last month it was about ventilators. Now, we have so many that we’re able to give them to Italy, France, Spain, other countries have been asking us for ventilators. We’re making over 150,000, we’ve distributed thousands and thousands. New York is in great shape with what we’ve done, as you know. New Jersey’s in great shape. We spoke just recently. Ivanka just spoke with the governor. And they’re in very good shape with the ventilators. And most of them have far more than they’ll ever need. They’re starting to send them back. So-
… far more than they’ll ever need. They’re starting to send them back, so nobody went without a ventilator. Yet if you read the media from a month and a half ago, it was all about ventilators and ventilators are tough. That was a tough thing, but we should be very proud of our country.
We took assembly lines and they converted from cars and other things into ventilators and the job that we’ve seen has not been seen since World War II. What they have done in terms of the manufacturer of very high-grade ventilators is a basis, so now we don’t hear about that and I noticed that the testing is starting to die down because we now have the best testing anywhere in the world by far and we have more and that’s a good thing. That’s a very good thing. I’m happy about it.
We had a call yesterday with governors and I will say that I’m sure many of you were on that call, even though you shouldn’t have been. They shouldn’t have been, Amy, but they were. I wonder how that happened, but you heard the governors were thrilled. Now the following day, if you’ll get a Democrat on the call, they’ll say, “I saw some of them today.” They were so thrilled yesterday on a call that they thought it was a close call and today they were good, but they weren’t the same as they were yesterday because that’s the business they want to try and win on November 3rd.
But we’re doing a job the likes of which nobody’s ever done. I’m not talking about myself, I’m talking about people in the Army Corps of Engineers where we built hospitals, where we built thousands and thousands of beds all over the country. New York, what we did was incredible. 2,900 beds in a matter of days. What they’ve done is so incredible and FEMA, what they’ve done and the doctors and the professionals and all of the people that you see me with all the time, these are great people and they’ve really done a great job.
Now our country’s opening up again and I think it’s going to be very, very successful. I think that, I mean, Larry is here, we talked about it and we talk about it all the time. I think that third quarter, it’s obviously a transition quarter, but I think it’s going to be okay, maybe better than okay. Larry thinks better than okay. I think even more so than I do and then I think fourth quarter will be great and I think next year is going to be a tremendous year for this country.
Jennifer.
I think Mitch is looking at it, as I do, to an extent as the infrastructure, he likes infrastructure. We all do. We have to rebuild our country. $8 trillion has been spent. I wasn’t in favor of it. I can tell you that in the Middle East, $8 trillion. Think of it. Yet you wanted to fix a pothole in a roadway or in a highway in this country and you didn’t do it because they didn’t have the money because so much money was spent in the Middle East. Well, that says a whole different story now. We want to do infrastructure, but a lot of people, a lot of the Republicans would like to keep that as a separate bill, so we’ll see how that works out, Jennifer. We’ll see. Yeah, please.
Well, I think that like other things we’re going to, hopefully we’re going to come up with a vaccine. You never know about a vaccine, but tremendous progress has been made. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Oxford and lots of good things. You’ve been hearing the same things as I do. Tremendous progress has been made, we think, on a vaccine. You always have to say, think, and then you have to test it and that takes a period of time. But a lot of movement and a lot of progress has been made on a vaccine.
But I think what happens is it’s going to go away and this is going to go away and whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we’ll be able to handle it. We’ll be able to put out spurts and we’re very prepared to handle it. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about it, the invisible enemy. It’s a bad enemy. It’s a very tough enemy, but we’ve learned a lot. It’s in 184 countries, as you hear me say often. It’s hard to believe it’s inconceivable.
It should have been stopped at the source, which was China. Should have been stopped very much at the source, but it wasn’t. Now we have 184 countries going through hell. But I think that a lot of good things are going to happen and I really believe that fourth quarter is going to be, maybe, tremendous. The next year, I think, has a chance to be really getting close to record setting. We hope so. We hope we can be back where we were. We had the strongest economy anywhere in the world and I hope we’re going to be back there again.
Go ahead, please.
Well, I have. I have many people. I know many stories. I’ve spoken to three, maybe, I guess, four families unrelated to me. I did. I lost a very good friend. I also lost three other friends, two of whom I didn’t know as well, but they were friends and people I did business with and probably almost everybody in the room did.
It’s a bad death. It’s a bad thing. It grips onto some people. Now, we found out that young people do extraordinarily well. That’s why I think we can start thinking about schools, but of course we’re ending the school season, so you wouldn’t be back for too long. I noticed where Purdue University, a great school in a great state, wants to open and have students come in. I think that’s correct. Some colleges, I think, I saw Harvard wants to have students come back in the fall. I would hope that they’d have students.
I think that the whole concept of computer learning is wonderful, but it’s not, telelearning, but it’s not the same thing as a being in a classroom in a great college or a college of any kind. College, university, there’s nothing. You can’t replace that. Hopefully they’re going to be coming back. Young people do very well with this horrible scourge. They do very well.
I am going to see you tomorrow and we’ll have other things to talk about. We have a lot of interesting things. I don’t think we should have a news conference today because this is a news conference. In addition, it’s a celebration of these incredible people that have done such a good job and I think we found a couple of stars in this room today. I won’t tell you who, but there are a couple.
This guy right here is the biggest star in the room. Right? We’ll all agree he’s the … I vote. I vote for you. Great job you’ve done and I really appreciate it. I appreciate you being here. Couldn’t have done better.
Be careful. That could happen. That could happen. Be careful. We’ll have to do that, Amy. I think we could, maybe we could do something like that. You’re very good. He’s stolen the show, right? Do we agree? Doc, I’ll tell you. I’m getting ready with the eyes. Come on with me if you want. Do a quick one. Want to save a lot of time. We need time. We’re opening up the country doc, so we need a little time. I don’t want to spend two and a half hours at an eye doctor, all right? We’ll think about that. We want to do that. I want to thank everybody and in particular, Jovita. I want to thank you very much and Steve, I can call Steve at any time. I can call him at 2:00 in the morning, 6:00 in the morning. It doesn’t make any difference. I say, “Did I wake you?” The answer is always, “No.” He’s doing a great job.
We’re proud of him and everybody is, everybody. Our government, we have to be proud of our government, that we have to be proud of our country. These are really terrific people. We’re going through a period of time, the likes of which we’ve never seen in this country before. Certainly even if you go back into 1917 that was the worst of all time, but it was also not as bad here. It was very bad. It was very rough. It was a bad one, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t quite like what we’re going through right now and it’s because of the amazing … When you look at how contagious this is where people literally just being in the same area with other people, it catches. I’m very proud of this country, I have to say. I’m very proud to be a president and I’m very proud of this country.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
124 Duck Street?
Get it ready.
If I don’t do it, they’re going to be very upset with me. You know that?
They will. Thank you, everybody.
",Donald Trump Small Business Relief Speech Transcript April 28,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-press-conference-transcript-april-28
Owen Paterson,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"I am delighted to be speaking at the conference which for more than 65 years has done so much to provide a platform for debate in the farming industry.
I must first acknowledge what a tough year this has been. The year that started in drought has ended in torrential rain and floods. Only yesterday, I saw for myself the impact of flooding on homes and farmland in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. These difficulties have been further compounded by pressure on prices, high feed costs and diseases such as bovine TB and Schmallenberg.
I would like to pay particular tribute to the generosity of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Westminster whose recent donations will bolster the work of organisations, such as the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution, in supporting those facing “need, hardship or distress”.
Despite these problems, there is much to be positive about. Farming in this country successfully produces food for 63.5 million people and supports industries that add nearly £90 billion to the UK economy. It also adds value in many other ways, from enhancing some of our most valuable habitats to managing the landscapes that underpin recreation and tourism.
Our farmers and landowners demonstrate on a daily basis how you can grow the economy while improving the environment. The two are not mutually exclusive. It is these twin objectives, alongside our determination to safeguard animal and plant health, that must guide everything Defra does.
Above all, I see Defra’s role as working to create the right conditions for rural businesses to thrive and grow. That includes investing £530 million in superfast broadband for rural areas by 2015, with £20 million for the most remote communities.
We are also overseeing a £150 million programme to get mobile phone masts into rural areas, helping to overcome the perennial frustrations of not-spots.
When it comes to flooding, we are investing more than £2.3 billion in flood prevention. The additional £120 million that we secured in the Autumn Statement, alongside the money brought in through our successful partnership funding programme, means that more money is being invested over this current spending review period than in any previous four year period. This investment doesn’t just focus on bricks and mortar: 59 projects completed during 2011/12 provided an improved level of flood protection to more than 74,000 hectares of agricultural land.
I am absolutely convinced that we can only improve the environment and enable farmers to continue to make the significant contribution they do if we have a growing, prosperous economy. I want to work with you to drive that growth.
From Turnip Townshend to Sir Joseph Nickerson, the industry has long been at the forefront of innovation through its development of new processes, technologies and land management techniques. This is something we must continue to champion.
The world’s population has grown from 2.5 billion in 1950 to just over 7 billion today. New technologies for food and agriculture are helping us to keep pace with the growing population. Between 1967 and 2007 crop yields increased by 115 per cent but land use only increased by eight per cent. Indur Goklany has calculated that if we tried to support today’s population using the production methods of the 1950s, instead of farming 38 per cent of all land, we would need to use 82 per cent. It has also been estimated that the production of a given quantity of a crop now requires 65 per cent less land than it did in 1961.
It is for these reasons that the UK Government as a whole invests over £410 million annually in research in the agriculture, food and drink sector. I am also working closely with David Willetts, the Science Minister, on the Agri-Tech Strategy. This will look at how best to capitalise on the UK’s world class science and technology base to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, as well as addressing the challenge of food security. We need to be able to translate research into new products, processes and technologies.
When we’re talking about innovation, we should also consider GM. In 2011, 16 million farmers in 29 countries grew GM products on 160 million hectares. That’s 11 per cent of the world’s arable land. To put it in context that’s 6 times larger than the surface area of the UK.
I fully appreciate the strong feelings on both sides of the debate. GM needs to be considered in its proper overall context with a balanced understanding of the risks and benefits. We should not, however, be afraid of making the case to the public about the potential benefits of GM beyond the food chain, for example, significantly reducing the use of pesticides and inputs such as diesel. As well as making the case at home, we also need to go through the rigorous processes that the EU has in place to ensure the safety of GM crops. I believe that GM offers great opportunities but I also recognise that we owe a duty to the public to reassure them that it is a safe and beneficial innovation.
The key for growth, however, must be for us to put the conditions in place so that we can get out of people’s hair and let them get on with what they are good at. I want our farmers to be farming not form-filling.
In response to the Farming Regulation Taskforce’s recommendations, we have made 137 commitments to reduce the regulatory burden on farmers.  I am keeping in close touch with progress and met Richard Macdonald, the Chairman of the Implementation Group, just before Christmas for an update. As a result of this work, there will be 12,000 fewer dairy inspections a year.  We must now crack on to replicate this across the industry, as well as reducing further the burden of paperwork.
I start from the position of trusting farmers. I am determined that we should move towards a system of “earned recognition”.  Such a system would acknowledge that the majority of farmers adhere to high standards and ensure that those who do are rewarded by less frequent inspections.
While many of the changes that we have made will not have grabbed the headlines, I do believe that they are beginning to make a practical difference. Since 2011, we have removed over £13 of unnecessary compliance costs for every £1 added. There is however no room for complacency. I know, for example, that there are areas like movement of livestock that still require real work.
I am keen to hear from farmers about how regulation affects them and their businesses, day in day out, in order to work to improve the system.
To put farming on a sustainable footing, it needs a highly skilled workforce. We need entrepreneurial, ambitious people who have both the motivation to succeed and the skills to do so. There are half a million people employed in agriculture and horticulture. And almost 4 million in the food and drink sector in total.
I welcome the lead the industry is taking in  promoting itself to young people and supporting new entrants, not least through the ‘Bright Crop’ initiative, which is working to change perceptions. We will continue to support the industry in its efforts to get the right people with the right skills into the right jobs and that is why David Heath, the Farming Minister, will be making a more detailed announcement on the ‘Future of Farming’ group later on today.
There are exciting opportunities at every level of the industry, ranging from agronomy to research and engineering. We should be encouraging graduates and people with experience and skills from other sectors to take advantage of them. People need to know that many of these roles involve multi-million pound budgets and cutting-edge science. All of them put food on the nation’s plates.
I am personally committed to ensuring that we seize the opportunities that the growing global demand for high-quality UK products presents us with. Food and drink exports were worth £18.2 billion in 2011 – the seventh year of continuous export growth.
There are some great examples of new markets that we are opening up. After lengthy negotiations, Russia has just lifted its ban on British beef and lamb imports in a deal potentially worth £80 million over the next three years. China has also opened its doors to British pork, enabling us to export the fifth quarter for which there is little demand in the UK with a value of £50 million a year.
In November, I visited Shanghai as part of the largest ever delegation of food and drink companies from the UK to open the Food and Hotel China trade fair. I also attended a reception in Hong Kong where I carved a prime piece of Yorkshire beef to promote our new agreement to sell beef on the bone there.  I intend to return to China later this year to build on these foundations.
British food is increasingly marketable abroad thanks to its excellent reputation. Our animal welfare standards are some of the highest in the world. We have top quality ingredients and raw materials, coupled with rigorous food production systems. We have totally reliable traceability.
We must not only capitalise on the opportunities that exist across the globe but also on the huge support amongst the public for UK farmers and the genuine desire to buy local products. We need to convert this support into buying decisions, supporting growth in the sector and the wider economy.
At home, we are currently 78 per cent self-sufficient in the type of food we are able to grow in this country. We currently import 22 per cent of food that could be produced here. For example, we have a £1.2 billion trade deficit in dairy products. Each year we bring in 115,000 tonnes of ice cream – more than double the 50,000 we send abroad, 150,000 tonnes of yoghurt – six times the 25,000 we export. British fruit and vegetable growers are in a similar position.
We can all do more and, just as everyone got behind Team GB last summer, we must get behind our food producers. By buying British, we boost the rural economy and enjoy some of the best quality produce in the world.
In addition to the role farmers play as food producers, the public places a huge value on the work they do for the environment. The Government supports this work through its agri-environment schemes. Around 70 per cent of our agricultural land is covered by such agreements and we continue to develop our schemes with a new winter bird feeding option coming on stream this week.  Only recently, Tedney Farm in Worcestershire became our 10,000th Higher Level Stewardship scheme, delivering benefits for agriculture and the environment.
2013 is an important year for CAP reform. That is why I plan to attend all of the Agriculture Council meetings in person. I am working hard to build alliances with other Member States, both in the Council and the Parliament. In December I hosted a lunch for like-minded agricultural ministers from countries in the Stockholm Group to explore common ground for sensible reform. It is also important that the CAP reflects how the UK works, so we’ve been working with the devolved Ministers and arguing for decision-making at regional level.
In the current negotiations, I know where I would like European agriculture to end up, although we might not get there this time. It is clear that in this round, due to run until 2020, Pillar 1 will continue.
I would like decisions on which food to produce to be left to the market, so farmers alone decide which crops to grow and which animals to raise according to demand in the food sector. While this is already happening, and farmers have risen to the challenge, with over 90 per cent of EU support payments now decoupled, there’s more to do. I do, however, believe that there is a role for taxpayer’s money in compensating farmers for the work they do in enhancing the environment and providing public goods for which there is no market mechanism. Farming makes a real contribution to our habitats and wildlife.  We must be able to continue to develop our agri-environment schemes.
Throughout this process, I have made it clear to Commissioner Ciolos that if his reforms continue the process set in train by MacSharry and Fischler I will support them. If they seek to take us backwards, I will not.
I will continue to push for greater simplification as we cannot afford another round of unnecessarily complex or costly reforms. This would risk undermining the progress that has been made at the RPA, which saw it achieve its best ever performance in December paying out more than £1.4 billion to 97,000 farmers. Last time the CAP was reformed, the changes were so horrendously complicated that we struggled to implement them and ended up paying out over €550 million in disallowance – the EU’s euphemism for clawing back our money.
As we explore farming’s broader contribution to society, it is vital that we find ways of placing a value on nature so that we can make informed choices when it comes to assessing the economic value of one form of farming against the environmental value of another.
We have established the Natural Capital Committee, chaired by Professor Dieter Helm, to explore how we might be able to create a value system around our natural capital which acknowledges the diversity and benefits we all enjoy from our wildlife and landscapes alongside the need for a living, working countryside.
What potential, for example, is there for a credits system that takes into account the difference between habitats and their relative scarcity, building on the sort of offsetting approach that we are piloting in the planning system through section 106 agreements? This is an approach that is already being deployed in the USA and Australia.
I hope that the Committee’s work will help us identify a system which recognises the importance of agricultural production and wildlife, moving us away from the polarised nature of previous debates.
The health of our animals and the important role they play in both our economy and environment must be at the heart of everything Defra does.
We must not only ensure that our native animals are healthy for economic reasons – in 2011 exports of beef and lamb totalled £851 million alone – but the very important role they play in supporting our landscapes and biodiversity.
Many of our most delicate landscapes and wildlife – the landscapes which have inspired some of our most famous artists and which continue to attract millions of visitors – depend on the presence of animals such as the Herdwick in the Lake District or the Southdown on the Downs.  These animals, and the benefits we derive from them, sum up the multi-faceted contribution farming makes to society.
Bovine TB is the most pressing animal health problem in the UK. Its impact on our cattle farmers, their families and their communities cannot be overstated. Last year TB led to the slaughter of 26,000 cattle in England at a cost of nearly £100 million. In the last 10 years bovine TB has cost the taxpayer £500 million. This will rise to an estimated £1billion over the next decade if the disease is left unchecked.
Coming from a farming background, and representing a constituency where the cattle industry is central to both its economy and character, I have long taken a deep interest in this issue.  As a Shadow Minister I tabled more than 600 Parliamentary Questions on the subject and met international experts in the field.
Research in this country over the past fifteen years has clearly demonstrated not only that cattle and badgers transmit the disease to each other but that the culling of badgers can lead to a reduction of the disease in cattle if carried out over a large enough area for a sufficient length of time. We must also learn from the experience of other countries which shows that TB in cattle cannot be controlled without also bearing down on it in the surrounding wildlife population. In New Zealand, the number of infected cattle and deer herds has been reduced from 1,700 in the mid 1990s to fewer than 100 in 2011. This is a result of rigorous biosecurity, strict cattle movement controls and proactive wildlife management.  A similar approach has been successfully deployed in Australia, the Republic of Ireland and the USA.
The decision, based on the advice of the NFU, to postpone the culls last autumn was a disappointing one for us all but the right one in terms of the effective delivery of the policy. I would like to thank the NFU’s leadership, staff and members for the huge amount of work they put in on the ground and their courageous public stance on this emotive issue.
The pilots will go ahead this summer.  That’s why I have established a project board with all the key partners – including Defra and its agencies, the NFU, Natural England and the police – to oversee the delivery of the pilot culls.  We are all committed to working together in partnership to ensure that the culls go ahead and to establish a sustainable model for future deployment.
Culling is, however, only one element of the Government’s approach to tackling bovine TB. That is why we continue to strengthen cattle movement controls, increase our surveillance testing regime and invest in research into badger and cattle vaccines. I’m also keen to pursue better diagnostic techniques such as PCR and to work with the European Commission on a way forward on vaccination.
With an injectable cattle vaccine and a legal and validated diagnostic test still some way off, I am acutely aware of the burden the increasingly stringent on-farm measures are placing on farmers. That’s why I am determined to use every tool at our disposal and to bear down on the disease in both cattle and badgers.
The presence of Schmallenberg on our shores is another reminder of the many threats to our livestock. It’s a midge-borne disease so we have no way of stopping it and there is no known cure. Defra is funding research in the UK and collaboratively with other EU countries to find out more about this virus, how it spreads, how it works and what its impact is. We continue to work with the AHVLA to raise awareness and provide testing for farmers’ flocks.
We don’t just face animal diseases though. We have to be increasingly vigilant for disease in our plants and trees. Ash dieback has served as a timely reminder of the need for us to prioritise plant health and the centrality of plants to our economy, landscape and history.
In October, I asked our Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Ian Boyd, to convene an Independent Taskforce on Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity to review our strategic approach to plant health and to think outside the usual political, regulatory and resource constraints. Their initial recommendations lay the groundwork for a radical reappraisal of how we approach plant health.
The interim control plan for Chalara, published in December, builds on the tree health summit that we organised for more than 100 forestry experts, campaign groups and businesses and the two COBR meetings I chaired to co-ordinate our response across government and across the UK.
We will reduce the spread of the disease by maintaining the ban on the import and movement of ash trees. We will work with research councils and European partners on research into spore production at infected sites and on understanding genetic resistance.  Farmers, landowners, voluntary organisations and the general public all have a crucial role to play in helping us identify diseased and potentially resistant trees. We will also work with the horticulture and nursery sectors on long-term resilience.
I am determined that disease in trees and plants is given the same priority as that in animals.
I have lived in the countryside all my life and represented a rural constituency for more than 15 years. I am in no doubt about the vital role farming plays in our society economically, environmentally and socially.
I believe that government’s role is to help where it is needed and to get out of the way where it is not. That’s why we are determined to put in place the conditions that will enable the industry to capitalise on the very real opportunities that exist at home and abroad and to put itself on a firm footing for the future. By doing this, we will have a flourishing, outward-looking industry boosting growth in the economy while improving the environment: a confident industry delivering for society.
I look forward to working with you and I wish you all a successful New Year.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-12-26,"So we're meeting with some of our great leaders. We're in Iraq. We flew all night and arrived very safely. It was an interesting trip, I will tell you that. I know there was a lot of security up there in the air, the skies -- they tell me. But here we are. We're discussing strategy. We're discussing lots of things, including even nearby Syria.
We're -- there's no military like we have. We can do whatever we want. But we have to decide what's right, what's not right. They've done a fantastic job over the last two years that I've been here. I can tell you, speaking from personal knowledge, they've done a fantastic job. And it's a great honor to meet all of you, and we're going to be meeting some other people a little bit later.
And then we're going to be speaking in front of your troops, and I look forward to that. That'll be happening in a little while. And I want to thank the press. You've made a journey. You knew where you were going, and we appreciate your coming with us, very much so. That takes courage also. We very much appreciate you coming with us. So thank you very much.
Do you have any questions in the media?
Well, it's a place that I've been talking about for many years. And many, many years, before it started, I was talking about it, as a civilian. And many of you know what my feelings were. And I wanted to come and see Iraq. I wanted to come and pay my respects, most importantly, to the great soldiers, the great troopers that we have here.
Nobody better. We brought along John Bolton, brought along the First Lady, and some other great people -- very talented people. But I wanted to see what we were doing over here. I tell you what, I'm very impressed with these folks. We've gotten a lot of communication through the White House, but I wanted to see it firsthand.
And so we flew -- we left at about 11:00, and we flew all night. And I think it's going to be well worth it.
Well, you know, we can do things from Iraq that -- we can take over some of the slack. But, as you know, we've knocked out about 99 percent of the caliphate. It's time to bring them back. I told the generals -- about a year and a half ago, I said, ""Let's get out of Syria."" And they said, ""Sir, can we have some more time?"" I said, ""Yep.
You've got another six months. Let's get out of Syria."" I've said it for a long time. And then -- and other places, too, I was talking about. But let's talk about Syria. I said, ""Let's get out of Syria. Let's bring our young people home."" And they said, ""Sir, could we have six more months?"" I said, ""Yep.
You've got six more months. Let's go."" And I gave them six months. Then I said, ""Let's get out."" And they said, ""Sir, could we have six more months?"" I said, ""Yep. You've got six more months."" And then they said again, recently, ""Could we have more time?"" I said, ""Nope. You can't have any more time. You've got enough time."" We've knocked them out.
We've knocked them silly. I will tell you that I had some very good talks with President Erdogan, who wants to knock them out also. And he'll do it. And others will do it, too, because we're in their region; they should be really sharing the burden of cost, and they're not. And now they're going to be doing it. And if they don't, they're going to go in, and they'll go into places like Turkey and Russia and Iran and Iraq and lots of others places.
So these people are going to have to start doing a lot of their own work, and they're going to have to start paying for it, because the United States cannot continue to be the policeman of the world. We don't want to do that. We want to protect our country. These people want to protect our country. They've been here a long time.
No plans at all, no. In fact, we could use this as a base if we wanted to do something in Syria. If -- I will say this, if you take ISIS and if we see something happening with ISIS that we don't like, we can hit them so fast and so hard, they won't -- they really won't know what the hell happened. But it's time to get our soldiers out, and it's time to get our young people out.
And I've been signing plenty of letters, and I don't like sending those letters home to parents, saying that your young man or your young woman has been killed. And I don't like doing it. We've been doing it long enough. We've been here, and if you look at Afghanistan, 19 years. We've been doing it a long time.
And these people at this table have been incredible. These are incredible people. And these are incredible men and women. But we've been doing it a long time. So I gave notice in Syria -- you know, the way it was reported was like I just pulled out; I didn't just pull out. I've been talking about it for a year and a half.
I've been telling the generals, ""Let's go. Go ahead, take more time. Let's go. Take more time."" Constantly giving them more time. Finally, I said, ""Okay, it's now time for others to take over that fight."" We don't want to be there. If you look at Syria -- so we went there about eight years ago, and it was supposed to be for a three-month period of time.
We never left. It's time to bring our people back home. Thank you.
Well, I had a good debate with Lindsey Graham in front of a lot of people the other day. Lindsey Graham is somebody that I like, that we work together -- we agree on many things. We agreed on Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. We agreed on many things.
I think that a lot of people are going to come around to my way of thinking. It's not fair when we burden the -- when the burden is all on us, the United States. We're building now -- as you folks know, you're seeing new equipment coming in for the first time in many years -- $716 billion and $700 billion, the last two years.
Far more than you ever got. And now we're buying all beautiful, new fighter jets. And we're buying -- we're building new ships. We're doing a lot of new things, even the equipment for your men and women. But it's time for us to start using our head. We don't want to be taken advantage anymore by countries that use us and use our incredible military to protect them.
They don't pay for it, and they're going to have to. Now, if you look at what happened in Syria, President Erdogan stepped up, and he says he wants to knock out ISIS. We say, ""Whatever's left."" It's just the remnants of ISIS. And Saudi Arabia just came out and said they're going to pay for some economic development, which is great.
That means we don't have to pay. But we may help, at some point. We may go back and help. We can do a lot of things with our companies and others, where they go out and they do a great job. But the bottom line is: We're going to use our heads, and wealthy countries cannot continue to use the United States to defend them.
These are wealthy countries. These are seriously wealthy countries, in certain cases, that I'm talking about. I'm not only talking about in the Middle East. I'm talking about all over the world. Wealthy countries cannot expect the United States to pay for a vast majority of their military. They can pay us. They can reimburse us. There's nobody has a military like us, but we're all over the world.
We're spread out all over the world. We're in countries that most people have never even heard about. And, frankly, it's ridiculous. So that's the story. It's very simple. I wanted to come to Iraq. I wanted to meet these great heroes. And that's what we're doing, and that's why we're here. That's why we took that flight.
Yeah.
Well, I don't see it. And I spoke with Bibi. I told Bibi. And, you know, we give Israel $4.5 billion a year. And they're doing very well defending themselves, if you take a look. But we'll be there for Israel. We'll always be there for Israel. I'm the one that moved the embassy to Jerusalem. You know, nobody was willing to do that.
All these Presidents came and went. They all said they will do it. They never did it. Many, many Presidents said they were going to move the embassy to Jerusalem. They never did it; I did it. Big difference. So that's the way it is. We're going to take good care of Israel. Israel is going to be good. But we give Israel $4.5 billion a year.
And we give them, frankly, a lot more money than that, if you look at the books -- a lot more money than that. And they've been doing a very good job for themselves.
Well, I did this -- about three or four weeks ago, we set this up. We actually had a couple of them set up, and we cancelled for security reasons because people were finding out. Pretty sad, when you spend $7 trillion in the Middle East, and going in has to be under this massive cover, with planes all over and all of the greatest equipment in the world, and you do everything you can to get in safely.
Pretty sad. You spend $7 trillion, and you have to come in through military escorts and all of the other incredible things that they did. Incredible.
Whatever it takes. I mean, we're going to have a wall. We're going to have safety. We need safety for our country, even from this standpoint. We have terrorists coming in through the southern border. We have the terrorists also coming in, fellas, through the southern border. Because you know why? It was always the easiest.
Now, we've made it very tough, but -- I won't put them on the spot, but I guarantee you, they would say, ""You don't have a wall, you're not going to have…"" I mean, the folks that are saying, ""Can we have some drones? Can we have technology?"" Technology is bells and whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection.
But we have, in addition to drugs, in addition to human trafficking, in addition to mass numbers of illegals who are coming in -- many of whom are criminals. You saw that. Six hundred and eighteen, so far, that we found -- in some cases, very serious criminals. In some cases, murderers. You saw that yourselves.
It was on your cameras for everybody to see. We need a wall. So when you say, ""How long is it going to take?"" When are they going to say that we need border security? When are the Democrats going to say it? Don't forget, the Democrats all agreed that you need a wall, until I wanted it. Once I wanted it, they didn't agree.
Steve.
Well, we have wonderful man in there now, as you know. Our friend, Shanahan, is a good man, and he's done a great job. And he's a good buyer. I wanted somebody that could buy, because I’m giving a lot of money and I don't want it to be wasted. You know, when I came here, they were spending -- for a $4 billion aircraft carrier, they were up to $16 billion.
That's not me; that's them. I inherited that and many other things. Cost overruns all over the place. So Shanahan was at Boeing, and did a great job at Boeing. He was there for a long time. Boeing is a hell of a company. He did a great job. Very responsible for the success of a certain plane, the Dreamliner.
And he's a respected man. He could be there for a long time. I mean, I'm in no rush. I will say that I've got everybody -- everybody and his uncle wants that position. And also, by the way, everybody and her aunt -- just so I won't be criticized for that last statement. Everybody wants that position. Everybody.
Everybody -- so many people want to be -- who wouldn't want to be Secretary of Defense? Even these folks would like to be Secretary of Defense. Who wouldn't want to be? This guy, he's looking over there.. We have a lot of great people who want to be Secretary of Defense.
We'll take our time and we'll make the right decision.
Well, you know -- as you know, we've already built a lot of wall. We're building a lot more, you know, just through the normal budget. And we fixed a tremendous amount of wall -- many miles. Sarah can give you the numbers. Sarah Sanders can give you the numbers. But we've fixed a lot of wall, and we've renovated it. It's very, very good.
It's as good as new. And, you know, many, many miles of that. And we've also built new wall a lot. But we just gave out a contract that, when it's all completed out, it'll be 115 miles. That's a lot. We're talking about 500 to 550 miles. And this will be -- just this one contract is 115. I'm going there -- I assume you're coming with me -- on probably the end of January, a little bit before the State of the Union.
I think we're going to do it before the State of the Union Address. I'll be going to Texas, and we're going to be sort of having a long -- we'll have a long groundbreaking, because it covers a lot of territory. But we're going to have a groundbreaking for the wall.
Here's the problem -- yeah, here's the problem we have: We have a problem with the Democrats because Nancy Pelosi is calling the shots, not Chuck. And Chuck wants to have this done. I really believe that. He wants to have this done. But she's calling the shots, and she's calling them because she wants the votes.
And probably, if they do something, she's not going to get the votes, and she's not going to be Speaker of the House. And that would be not so good for her. Because she's got -- you know, she's in a very tight contest. I know her contest very well; I know it maybe better than she does. I know exactly where she is. And she's in a very, very tight contest.
There are those that say she doesn't have the votes yet. Let's see what happens. I say she does. But if Chuck does this, it could very well have negative implications on her becoming Speaker of the House. So they all know you need it; they all know you need this border security. They all know you need the wall -- or whatever you want to call it -- in order to secure our border, which these people know more about than anybody.
And they can tell you, you need a wall. But the one who is calling the shots is Nancy Pelosi.
I'm not going to talk about it now. But I will say this: We have been building a lot of wall. A lot of people don't know it, and I haven't really been stressing it, frankly, because maybe I felt it wasn't the right thing to do. But we've been building a lot of wall. If you go out, you'll see it. Or we can give you an exact list.
Sarah, you'll do that. But we're building now -- we just gave out a contract, as you know; I just released it the other day. But we are building a lot of wall. We have a lot of great wall going in the most important places. We're starting in the most important places, which I would say history says, fellas, that's a good thing to do, right?
Do the most important places first and do the least important places last. So we are probably up to -- with what we're building now and what we're going to start very shortly, we're probably up to over 200 miles of wall. Nobody knows that, nor did I want to tell anybody. So we are moving very rapidly. And I have other sources if I need them.
But we have to do it the right way. Look, the American public is demanding a wall. I think they're under a lot of pressure. The problem is, we need 10 Democrat votes in the Senate. The House is 100 percent. You saw that. Nancy said we'd never get the votes in the House. Not only did we get them, we got them by a lot -- 217 to 185. I mean, we got them by a lot.
Nobody believed that. Nancy Pelosi sat, and she said you couldn't get the votes in the House. And then we got the votes in the House. And that was for $5.8 billion. So we're doing well. The problem is, we need 10 votes in the Senate, and they have to be Democrat votes. They can't -- you know, people don’t understand.
They hear we have the majority. Well, we have, right now, the majority by one. Soon, we'll have the majority by three because we won the Senate and we picked up. Nobody ever reports that, but we won the Senate and we picked up two seats, which is -- you know, someday one of you guys are going to get out and actually report that.
There are those that say it's more important because that's what approves Supreme Court judges, judges, people -- everything. But we won the Senate, and people were very surprised at how well we did in the Senate. We almost won three additional seats that we weren't expected to be anywhere near. So Nancy is calling the shots.
And they all know -- look, politically speaking -- I don't do it for politics; I'm doing nothing for politics. But, politically speaking, people want border security, okay? One more question?
One more.
Absolutely, when I heard what you had to go through.
I mean, look, I had concerns for the institution of the presidency because -- not for myself, personally. I had concerns for the First Lady, I will tell you. But if you would have seen what we had to go through, with the darkened plane, with all windows closed, with no lights on whatsoever, anywhere -- pitch black.
I've never seen it; I've been in many airplanes -- all types and shapes and sizes. I've never seen anything like it. We're coming in, and I know all of the things that were surrounding us for safety. So did I have a concern? Yeah, I had a concern, but my bigger concern was maybe the people that were with me, certainly all of them -- except, I think, John Bolton.
He's a pretty tough guy. He can handle it. Right, John? John can handle it. And, by the way, John and I agree on all of this. And I think John will say that we went through numerous -- extension, extension, extension. John -- and John is, you know, pretty strong on the subject. He's pretty strong. He's pretty hawkish on everything having to do with the military.
And, by the way, I think I’m probably more hawkish than anybody. Anybody. Nobody is more hawkish than me. But I also like to use it in the right place. And, frankly, I like not using it at all. And one of the things we're doing is we are building the greatest force that we've ever had, that we've ever had.
We've never had a force like we're building, in terms of the equipment. We have the best people, to start off with. And by doing what I'm doing, hopefully, we won't have to use it. But there is nobody that believes more strongly in having a powerful military than I do. And we're respected once again in the world, and that's nice to see because our military -- I'm not going to put them on the spot, but our military was seriously depleted when I took office.
Seriously depleted. It was in bad shape. And very soon, it's going to be phenomenal shape. Okay? Thank you all very much.

Richard Nixon,United States of America,1972-11-07 00:00:00,"Good evening my fellow Americans:
Before going over to the Shoreham Hotel to address the victory celebration which is in process there, I wanted to take a moment to say a word to all of you in this very personal way, speaking from the Oval Office.
I first want to express my deep appreciation to every one of you, the millions of you who gave me your support in the election today, and I want to express my respect for millions of others who gave their support to Senator McGovern. I know that after a campaign, when one loses, he can feel very, very low, and his supporters as well may feel that way. And when he wins, as you will note when I get over to the Shoreham, people are feeling very much better.
The important thing in our process, however, is to play the game, and in the great game of life, and particularly the game of politics, what is important is that on either side more Americans voted this year than ever before, and the fact that you won or you lost must not keep you from keeping in the great game of politics in the years ahead, because the better competition we have between the two parties, between the two men running for office, whatever office that may be, means that we get the better people and the better programs for our country.
Now that the election is over, it is time to get on with the great tasks that lie before us. I have tried to conduct myself in this campaign in a way that would not divide our country, not divide it regionally or by parties or in any other way, because I very firmly believe that what unites America today is infinitely more important than those things which divide us. We are united Americans -- North, East, West, and South, both parties -- in our desire for peace, peace with honor, the kind of a peace that will last, and we are moving swiftly toward that great goal, not just in Vietnam, but a new era of peace in which the old relationships between the two super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and between the world's most populous nation, the People's Republic of China, and the United States, are changed so that we are on the eve of what could be the greatest generation of peace, true peace for the whole world, that man has ever known.
This is a great goal, bigger than whether we are Democrats or Republicans, and it is one that I think you will want to work with me, with all of us, in helping to achieve.
There are other goals that go with that -- the prosperity without war and without inflation that we have all wanted and that we now can have, and the progress for all Americans, the kind of progress so that we can say to any young American, whatever his background, that he or she in this great country has an equal chance to go to the top in whatever field he or she may choose.
I have noted, in listening to the returns a few minutes ago, that several commentators have reflected on the fact that this may be one of the great political victories of all time. In terms of votes that may be true, but in terms of what a victory really is, a huge landslide margin means nothing at all unless it is a victory for America. It will be a victory for America only if, in these next four years, we, all of us, can work together to achieve our common great goals of peace at home and peace for all nations in the world, and for that new progress and prosperity which all Americans deserve.
I would only hope that in these next four years we can so conduct ourselves in this country, and so meet our responsibilities in the world in building peace in the world, that years from now people will look back to the generation of the 1970s, at how we have conducted ourselves, and they will say, ""God bless America.""
Thank you very much.

Ron DeSantis,United States of America,2020-05-20,"Our data is available. Our data is transparent. In fact, Dr. Birx has talked multiple times about how Florida has the absolute best data. So any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative trying to be spun. And part of the reason is that because you got a lot of people in your profession who wax poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York. Wait two weeks. Florida’s going to be next. Just like Italy, wait two weeks. Well, hell we’re eight weeks away from that. And it hasn’t happened. Not only do we have a lower death rate, well, we have way lower deaths generally, we have a lower death rate than the Acela corridor, DC, everyone up there. We have a lower rate death rate than the Midwest, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, but even in our region, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida has the lower death rate. And I was the number one landing spot from tens of thousands of people leaving the number one hot zone in the world to come to my state.
So we’ve succeeded, and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative. It challenges their assumption, so they got to try to find a boogeyman. Maybe it’s that they’re a black helicopter circling the Department of Health. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you.

Matthew Offord,United Kingdom,2020-01-28,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak after that passionate speech.
I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate, as I have more Jewish constituents than anyone else in the Chamber today, apart from, of course, my hon. Unfortunately he is not able to speak because he is a Whip, but I am sure he will be thrilled that I am, no doubt, speaking on his behalf as well.​
If, as a Member of Parliament for any faith group, I either promote or defend a cause or an issue, many critics will say, “Well, you would say that, wouldn’t you, because your constituents would expect you to do so.” For many of my constituents—and, by default, for me as well—the holocaust is something very personal. I have constituents who were in places such as Bergen-Belsen, one of whom I have spoken about previously in the Chamber, of whom I am indeed very fond, and whom I visit regularly. I should take this opportunity to wish mazel tov to Manfred Goldberg and Kurt Marx, who both received the British Empire Medal for services to holocaust education in the new year’s honours list. We are very proud of them.
Just like the hon. First, I always like to read a memoir or factual account of the holocaust, and I am pleased to be reading “If this is a man” by Primo Levi right now. The second thing I like to do—again, like the hon. Member for West Ham—is to consider Holocaust Memorial Day from a different perspective, and for the past few months I have been thinking about concentration camps on British soil.
Any Member who has read Nikolaus Wachsmann’s brilliant book “KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps” will know how the concentration camps came about. The KL refers to the German word “Konzentrationslager”. In Germany in 1933, many of the first people arrested by the Nazis were detained in a variety of locations, including police stations, stables, schools and even industrial buildings—certainly none of the locations we have in our public consciousness. Those people were held in “protective custody” for their own safety, and most of them were released at a later stage. During that time, the law was used to defend many of them. Their relatives went to the courts to say that their treatment was not as it should be, and under the law they did have some protections, but of course that did not last. We know that, as the second world war continued, the rules certainly changed.
The Konzentrationslager of Dachau in 1933 was very different from the Konzentrationslager of Auschwitz in 1944. Initially, Dachau targeted political opponents of the Nazis, such as German communists, socialists, Roma, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals and persons accused of asocial or socially deviant behaviour. By contrast, Auschwitz was a sprawling death camp containing European Jewry, Gypsies and others. As Primo Levi wrote:
“Trains heavily laden with human beings went in each day, and all that came out was the ashes of their bodies, their hair, the gold of their teeth.”
Representation of these camps in films and popular culture depicts Auschwitz-Birkenau as the pinnacle of the death camps, but Treblinka was close behind it in the number of people who were murdered, alongside other camps such as Belzec, Chelmno and Sobibor. All those camps were devoted to killing. They were death camps, and anyone who went through their gates would not come out again. In 1967, the West German Ministry of Justice drew up a list of 1,200 camps that it said were sub-camps of the main ones. The Jewish Virtual Library has come up with the even greater figure of 15,000 camps that it says were effectively Konzentrationslager.​
To many of us, the representation of the camps through their names suggests a distant location and an otherness that is foreign and certainly not part of the British collective consciousness, but that is not the case. Last summer I was fortunate enough to sail to the Channel Islands, the only part of the British Isles to be inhabited by the Nazis during the second world war, and I visited Alderney. In January 1942, the Nazis built four camps in Alderney. There were two work camps, Lager Helgoland and Lager Borkum, and two concentration camps, Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney. Lager Norderney contained Russian and Polish prisoners of war, and the Lager Sylt camp held Jewish slave labourers. There are 397 graves in Alderney, out of a total population of about 6,000. On their return to Alderney, the islanders had little or no knowledge of the crimes that had taken place, because when they were finally allowed to return in December 1945, the majority of the senior German officers had left and no one really knew what had happened.
Interestingly, in research being conducted by Professor Caroline Sturdy Colls at Staffordshire University, she has described the estimate of the number of victims as “very conservative”, given the difficulty of identifying prisoners in war records. The whole issue of post-holocaust archaeology is very much a contested area, and indeed very painful for many people who had direct experience of the holocaust. The professor has said that her research on the island has come up against great “hostility”, including from the Alderney Government, who she said had refused a permit for her to excavate some of the sites, forcing her to rely, in the research that she undertook, on “non-invasive” methods of analysis, such as drone filming.
I have to tread carefully as I say this, but there is also some reluctance on the part of the Jewish community in the United Kingdom to give permission for the excavation of Jewish burial sites. This is a very delicate area, and I know that the great Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who is my constituent, has been involved in this issue. Rabbinic law dictates that the grave sites of Jewish people should not be disturbed. I have a great deal of sympathy with that point of view, but I do have a belief that unmarked graves, mass graves and locations of bodies hidden by their murderers are not proper graves in themselves, and I believe that it is appropriate for the identification of bodies to be undertaken, because people do need a proper resting place. I do not believe that the locations that I have described are proper graves; and as Elie Wiesel wrote,
“to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.”
So I certainly will continue with the conversations that I have had with others about the delicate, sensitive process of identifying locations of bodies, and also the persons in those graves.
So for me, Holocaust Memorial Day is not just something that is evoked through films such as “Schindler’s List”; it is something that is very personal and pertinent to many of my constituents. I shall conclude with the words of Primo Levi, in his fantastic book, in which he says:
“It happened, therefore it can happen again: this is the core of what we have to say.”

Tony Blair,United Kingdom,2015-09-12,"During her long and extraordinary life, her grace, her sense of duty and her remarkable zest for life made her loved and admired by people of all ages and backgrounds, revered within our borders and far beyond.   She was part of the fabric of our nation and we were all immensely proud of her.
Along with her husband, King George VI, she was also a symbol of our country’s decency and courage.
Her bravery, when she refused point blank to leave London and her husband’s side during the Blitz epitomised both her own indomitable spirit and the spirit of the nation in its darkest hours. Later as Queen Mother, she was a unifying figure for Britain, loved by all, sharing in its joys and troubles.
But respect for her went far beyond Britain.  Throughout the Commonwealth and the world she was greeted with instant affection and acclaim. Above all, she was motivated by the most powerful sense of duty and service, enhanced by her profound religious conviction.
She believed that the Royal Family’s role and duty was to serve the British nation and she carried out that duty with total and selfless devotion.
Our thoughts are with The Queen, and particularly so after the sad loss of Princess Margaret, and with all the Royal Family, with whom Britain mourns, united in grief at our loss and giving thanks for a life of extraordinary service to our country.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-09-25,"Hello everyone.
I’m happy to be here today with Minister Anand, Dr. Tam, and Dr. Njoo.
Right from the start of the pandemic, our government’s top priority has been to keep Canadians safe from COVID-19.
As we laid out in the Throne Speech on Wednesday, protecting people will continue to be job one as we move forward.
And one of the best ways to do that is with a safe and effective vaccine. 
Our government has already invested in a strategy for increased screening, and support for vaccine research and clinical trials.
We’ve been guided by science since the very beginning.
And right now, both the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force and the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force are doing important work to help us identify the most promising vaccine options and strategies.
Last month, I announced that the Government of Canada had signed agreements with Novavax, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to secure millions of doses of the vaccines they are developing.
We have also secured agreements with Pfizer and Moderna.
And earlier this week, Minister Anand announced that the Government of Canada has now also signed agreements with Sanofi and with GlaxoSmithKline to secure up to 72 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
The solutions to eradicate this pandemic can be found in screening, scientific research, and vaccines.
Canadians must have access to a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 as quickly as possible, no matter where it was developed.
Today, we are taking another step in the right direction.   
I can announce that we’ve reached an agreement with AstraZeneca for the vaccine they are developing with the University of Oxford.
This agreement secures up to 20 million doses for Canadians, should the vaccine be approved following successful trials.
I know Minister Anand will have more to say about this in a few minutes, but before she does, I also want to talk about another measure we’re taking on vaccines.
This pandemic can’t be solved by any one country alone.
Because to eliminate the virus anywhere, we need to eliminate it everywhere.
That’s why Canada is helping ensure vaccines are distributed quickly and fairly around the world by supporting GAVI’s COVAX Facility and Advance Market Commitment.
Our government will invest an additional $440 million for the COVAX facility to provide doses around the world, for Canadians and for people in developing countries.
Up to $220 million of this investment will go directly towards securing doses for Canadians.
This means this agreement will give us the option to purchase up to 15 million doses for Canadians.
As of today, we now have active cases in every single province, with a significant increase in our four largest provinces.
So please, everyone, keep following public health recommendations.
Wash your hands, keep your distance, wear a mask, and download the COVID Alert app.
What we do now will be critical for the weeks and months to come.    
The fight against COVID-19 is not over yet, and we must all continue to do our part.
Our government is right there with you, as we work to keep people safe, while building a stronger, more resilient Canada.
Thank you.

Theresa May,United Kingdom,2019-07-17,"Good afternoon everyone and thank you all for joining us today, in particular to Minister Goyal – it is a real pleasure to have you here and to have been able to speak with you.
Mansion House is an historic venue.
But from where I stand today I see the very modern face of UK-India relations.
World-leading businesses.
Cutting-edge technology.
The innovators and entrepreneurs, the thinkers and the do-ers, who are working hand-in-hand with colleagues and counterparts on the other side of the world to grow our economies and, in doing so, help all our people grow too.
Our nations are many thousands of miles apart, our cultures in many ways very different.
But for all that diversity, the UK and India have much in common.
Our countries are twin pillars of the Commonwealth.
Each is built on shared values of democracy and the rule of law.
We are equally committed to open markets, to free trade and the international order.
Both governments are dedicated to tackling the global challenges – from security to climate change – that no one nation can defeat alone.
And, of course, we both share an extraordinary love of cricket.
After what happened at Lord’s on Sunday I’d be quite happy to give you an entire speech about cricket.
But given that India’s tournament ended a little earlier than hoped for, I am sure that half the room would rather I didn’t say anything too much about the World Cup too so I’ll move on.
But those shared values, that shared outlook, make possible a strong and lasting bond between our nations.
That is why in 2019 the story of the UK and India is not a story of our complex and intertwined history, but of the flows of capital, technology and business.
Of the “living bridge” of people and ideas that make us, in the words of Prime Minister Modi, an “unbeatable combination” – both today and for the future.
And what a combination it is.
In 2018, the combined turnover of Indian companies in the UK reached almost £50 billion, more than trebling in just five years.
Indian FDI in the UK is growing faster than that from any other country, soaring by an incredible 321 per cent in just 12 months.
Bilateral trade rose by 14 per cent last year.
The British Development Finance bank, CDC Group, invests more in India than anywhere else in the world – more than 300 investments totalling over £1.3 billion and directly supporting around 350,000 jobs.
And, with the support of the UK-India Financial Partnership, our world-leading financial sectors continually exchange capital and expertise.
Venture capital firms like Pontaq and Blume are seeking out innovative start-ups in both nations.
Joint ventures such as HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential are India’s leading private sector insurers.
London-based companies like Greensill are expanding their financing platforms in India.
And, in the past three years, Indian issuers have raised over £7.5 billion of bonds on the London Stock Exchange.
It is a story of incredible success for both our nations – and both our nations are committed to ensuring that it continues.
Over the past three years I have worked closely with Prime Minister Modi to make that happen.
Together, we’ve developed an ambitious UK-India Tech Partnership, which is already creating new jobs and supporting thousands more across the UK.
Together, we’ve launched a programme of collaboration on financial services, marrying the best of British expertise with India’s global leadership in technology.
Together – just last week, in fact – we have opened a £40 million Fast-Track Start-Up Fund, supported by both the UK and Indian governments, to invest in Indian start-ups focussed on emerging technology.
And together, we’ve launched a Green Growth Equity Fund – co-investing £240 million of anchor capital to invest in green and renewable energy.
That fund is particularly important and symbolic.
Because India and the UK do not only share values – we also, as I said at this month’s G20 meeting, share a responsibility to our planet.
Last month, the British Parliament passed a law requiring us to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the first major economy to make such a commitment.
Making a great step forward in renewable energy is the key to doing so, which is why we are proud to be joining the India-led International Solar Alliance…
Why the joint UK-India Clean Energy Centre is addressing the challenge of integrating intermittent renewable energy sources with energy storage…
And why the UK Government’s ground-breaking joint venture, UK Climate Investments, has so far made three investments in India, including £30 million for the country’s largest commercial rooftop solar developer.
There is no false choice to be made between cutting carbon emissions and raising living standards.
No contradiction in doing what is right for business and what is right for the environment.
Clean growth and economic growth can go hand-in-hand, as you can see right here in the Square Mile, where London’s unrivalled financial markets are raising huge sums to invest in a cleaner greener future for both our countries.
Over the past three years, Indian companies have raised £2 billion through green bonds listed on the LSE.
We are in the midst of an immensely productive period of economic relations between India and the UK.
And I am immensely proud of the work I have done with Prime Minister Modi over the past three years both to strengthen the ties between our nations, and to make sure that very special relationship works for all our people.
But I am nonetheless confident that the business links between our nations will continue to grow stronger and deeper, drawing us together and creating jobs and prosperity from Manipur to Manchester.
When the Indian government raises its first ever international sovereign bond later this year I hope they do so in the City of London – whose capital markets, with their unrivalled depth and liquidity, are the best in the world.
Yesterday saw the latest edition of the highly successful JETCO trade dialogue, at which representatives from both our nations discussed our approach to the removal of trade barriers in the years ahead.
And once we leave the EU, our new immigration rules will see an individual’s right to work in the UK determined not by where they were born, but by what they can bring to our nation – a boost for Indian employers who want to do business in the UK.
Such steps, along with the hard work and commitment of the people in this room, will ensure that the economic ties between our nations continue to thrive.
For many decades, the UK and India have been old friends.
Today, as we see here at Mansion house, we are increasingly working together as new partners.
So, while the months and years ahead will bring much change and many challenges, let us continue to build that relationship.
Let us support one another, bringing together people, capital and ideas to benefit the UK and India alike.
And let us turn the shared values that make our nations great into shared prosperity for all of our people.
Thank you.
",2019 Speech on India Day,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-may-2019-speech-on-india-day/
Tony Baldry,United Kingdom,2019-08-20,"I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important subject and I thank the Minister for the care that he has taken so far in dealing with the representations that I have made about the Horton hospital.
As both my parents have spent their working lives in the National Health Service—my father is a doctor and my mother a nurse—I have, naturally, always had an interest in the NHS, and since becoming the Member for Banbury I have taken a particular interest in the Horton general hospital. It is a first-class general hospital with well-qualified and highly motivated staff serving the medical needs of a wide catchment area stretching into Northamptonshire and Warwickshire.
Any debate on the NHS is liable to become either a statement of statistics or an exercise in special pleading. I hope to do neither. Horton is a well run hospital. The local community has every reason to have confidence in the hospital’s unit administrator, Dennis Baston, and his team. Whereas the average national daily cost per inpatient is £79, at Horton hospital it is only £66, and whereas the national average in-patient case cost is £577, at Horton it is £528.
Some people seek to give the impression that the NHS is in a state of constant decline, is starved of resources and has ever-shrinking staff numbers. In fact, the figures show that local health services have never had so many resources devoted to them. Revenue spending on health services in Oxfordshire has increased by 101·7 per cent. in cash terms since 1979, representing an increase in real terms of 13·2 per cent. That means that the Health Service in Oxfordshire has a budget 13·2 per cent. bigger than it was in 1979. Revenue spending on Horton general hospital has increased by 103·8 per cent. in cash terms since 1979, which represents an increase in real terms of 14·4 per cent.
During the past six years, about £2·25 million has been spent on new building works at the hospital, and during the next five years about £6,640,000 is planned to be spent on new building works. Since 1979, about £670,000 has been spent on new medical equipment at the hospital. There is no doubt that Horton general hospital is a more secure, better district hospital now than it was in 1979.
Against that background of consistent achievement in the NHS and consistent extra resources for the hospital, I raise my specific anxieties, because, despite the consistent improvement, many beds at the hospital are empty for want of nurses and some financial resources. The first legitimate anxiety relates to RAWP which, as my hon. Friend will know, is the formula by which resources are allocated from central Government to regional health authorities. There are good grounds for suggesting that Oxfordshire regional health authority is underfunded. As my hon. Friend will know, it is one of the fastest growing areas of population in Britain, yet although in 1977–78 the region was 7 per cent. above its RAWP target, it is now 3 per cent. below target. It would appear to have had a more negative movement than any other region. I do not understand why Oxfordshire regional health authority should be in that position. The region’s budget may be underfunded, so, however hard it tries, it will have ​ difficulties in meeting all its commitments. At the end of the day, that means that in a good district general hospital beds are not being used as they should be.
In a letter to me last October, my hon. Friend the Minister acknowledged that Oxfordshire is not receiving its fair share of resources. He said:
“It is true to say that Oxford RHA receives 3 per cent. less than its fair share of the available resources, whereas in 1977–78 it received 7 per cent. more than its share.”
What happened was that, just at the point when the region was on target to receive exactly its fair share, its relative need for health care increased because of rapid population growth. The target shifted. This had the effect of converting Oxfordshire health authority from an over-target region to an under-target region. In simple terms, that means that the regional health authority has insufficient funds for its means and is not receiving a fair share of the funds available.
I appreciate that, this year, Oxfordshire is receiving about £1·4 million of growth money from the Government to pay for better services. However, that entire sum may be swallowed by unexpected bills: £344,000 to cover Oxfordshire massive rates increase; £700,000 to pay for higher than expected wage awards; and £250,000 to pay for a new national agreement on ambulance men’s pay. I simply ask: when will Oxfordshire again receive its fair share of central Government money?
Our second anxiety relates to the nurses that the district health authority can provide at the Horton. That is partly a consequence of the resources that the regional health authority can apply to the district and the district health authority can apply to the hospital. Recently, Oxfordshire health authority undertook a comprehensive review of nursing. That review is not yet completed, but its results so far demonstrate such low numbers of nurses at present on the wards as to give rise to great anxiety. It is neither fair, sensible nor acceptable to allow the numbers of nurses on wards and in the community to reach such levels that the staff who remain become demoralised It is unfair to the nurses and to the patients. I fully appreciate that some of the problems relate to difficulties in recruiting nurses. Horton, like every other hospital in Oxfordshire, is suffering and is finding it difficult to recruit either state registered or state enrolled nurses. Nursing services are extremely stretched.
At Horton beds are closed because of a combination of recruitment problems and revenue difficulties.
In a recent letter to the county’s Members of Parliament, the district group manager, Dr Paine, observed:
“The options will have to be those which will bring up the level of nursing staff on individual wards to such a level that they can feel that they carry out their duties effectively and without exhaustion and disillusion, as is too commonly the present case. It looks as though some reductions of service will be inescapable if this is to be achieved within even the optimistic predictions for the district’s funding in 1986.”
That letter was written prior to certain of the unexpected expenditure which the district will incur, such as the rates increase to which I drew the attention of the House earlier.
There is genuine concern that, because Oxfordshire health authority has not been able fully to fund the increases in nurses’ pay, the number of nurses at Horton has had to be cut. That has meant that beds have had to come out of service and it has hit, in particular, cold ​ surgery so that the waiting times for operations have lengthened and on a number of occasions the hospital has not been able to use the operating theatres in the most cost effective way.
I have read with interest the auditor general’s recent study into nursing and I fully appreciate the argument that substantial savings can be made nationwide on redeploying nurses. However, having made several visits to Horton hospital, and having discussed the matter at considerable length with those involved, I am more than satisfied that in Horton the nursing staff are already being used as cost effectively and efficiently as possible, given the size of the hospital, the present 37½ hour working week which makes it difficult to provide 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week cover, and other constraints imposed by the Royal College of Nursing. I should be very surprised if anyone going into Horton could find a more cost effective way of using the money available for the nursing staff. The situation with nurses will be even more critical next year as each 1 per cent. increase in nurses’ pay, which is not funded centrally, costs Oxfordshire health authority £8 million. When will we have a system of pay reviews that ensures that health authorities have available locally the resources necessary to honour pay awards agreed nationally.
The last matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the House and which impinges upon the efficiency and effectiveness of Horton hospital is the effect of the recent introduction of the regulations on the maximum amount of money available to keep people in private nursing homes. I support fully the need to control such demand spending and understand why it was necessary to introduce the regulations. However, it is estimated that at any time there are up to 20 people in Horton hospital who are not really ill. They are old and would be far better off in nursing homes, but they cannot be admitted to private nursing homes because the Department of Health and Social Security cannot fund them. In consequence, they are costing the community far more by being in hospital and they are also taking up valuable beds which could be used by patients in need of acute medical beds.
The chairman of Oxfordshire health authority and the chairman of Oxfordshire community health council have as a matter of urgency been carrying out an evaluation of all the private nursing provision in Oxfordshire. If it should be shown that the present DHSS levels have been set too low to enable private nursing homes to provide proper accommodation for those who are entirely dependent upon the DHSS for support, I trust that my hon. Friend will again consider the limits. It must be in everybody’s interest that no acute bed in a general hospital is unnecessarily occupied.
I hope that by the tenor of my comments I have made it clear to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and to the House that I do not approach this matter by way of special pleading. I hope that I approach it by way of balanced and objective analysis, wishing to try to discover how it is that at a time when more money than ever before is being devoted to the Horton hospital and to the National Health Service as a whole we find ourselves in the curious position that, notwithstanding, there are empty beds at a good, efficient hospital like Horton. The Horton hospital is a first class general hospital. We intend to ensure that it remains a first class general hospital that is able effectively and efficiently to serve the medical needs of local people.
",1986 Speech on Horton Hospital in Banbury,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/tony-baldry-1986-speech-on-horton-hospital-in-banbury/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-05-18,"Thank you very much. It is a great pleasure to welcome President Santos to the White House. Colombia is one of our closest allies in the hemisphere, and today we reaffirm partnership between our two great nations.
President Santos and I had a very productive meeting, and we will continue to work very closely together to bring peace, safety and prosperity to the hemisphere. Perhaps no area is really more important in terms of cooperation than our joint effort to end the terrible drug crimes that plague both of our countries.
Recently, we have seen an alarmed -- and I mean really a very highly alarmed and alarming trend. Last year, Colombia coca cultivation and cocaine production reached a record high, which, hopefully, will be remedied very quickly by the President. We must confront this dangerous threat to our societies together.
Today, I affirmed the United States' willingness to assist Colombia's strategy to target and eliminate drug trafficking networks, illicit financings, coca cultivation, and cocaine production, of which there is far too much. The drug epidemic is poisoning too many American lives, and we're going to stop it many different ways. One of them will be the wall.
My administration is committed to keeping drugs and gangs from pouring into our country. Already border crossings are down more than 73 percent. Secretary Kelly is with us; he's done a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. And, in short, we have a tremendous group of people working with us in terms of ICE, the ICE Patrol and the Border Patrol agents. They've done a fantastic job, and I'd like you to give them my highest compliments, Mr. Secretary.
And MS-13, likewise -- a horrible, horrible, large group of gangs that have been let into our country over a fairly short period of time -- are being decimated by the Border Patrol, by ICE, and by our incredible local police forces. And they are getting out of our country, or, in some cases, going directly into prisons throughout our country. But they've literally taken over towns and cities of the United States. They will be gone very quickly.
I look forward to working with President Santos as we target drug trafficking. Both the United States and Colombia have strong law enforcement and security relationship. We've had it -- and especially over the last fairly short period of time. Together, we will continue to fight the criminal networks responsible for the deadly drug trade that our people have a really strong commitment to getting rid of, because they want a much brighter future.
President Santos and I also discussed the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, and it is really in a very bad state, as you see and as we all see through the media. The stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere, and America stands with all of the people in our great hemisphere yearning to be free. We will be working with Colombia and other countries on the Venezuelan problem. It is a very, very horrible problem. And from a humanitarian standpoint, it is like nothing we've seen in quite a long time.
The United States and Colombia are also strong economic partners, and we will continue to pursue trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. The nations' common goals of protecting our citizens, expanding opportunity, and confronting the drug crisis will improve the lives of our people and many throughout the region.
So many people are being so horribly affected by what's going on in terms of violence and in terms of drugs, and we're going to take care of the situation. And we've both agreed to take care of it strongly and quickly.
President Santos, it was an honor to meet with you and your entire group of representatives, very talented people indeed, who have been working with us and my representatives. And I look forward to many more productive meetings, such as the one we just had. I'd like to thank you very much for being at the White House, being our guest. And I'd like to congratulate you on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. That's a very great achievement. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Does anybody have any questions. Jon, go ahead.
Thank you.
Well, I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself -- and the Russians, zero.
I think it divides the country. I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things. So I can tell you that we want to bring this great country of ours together, Jon. And I will also say very strongly, we've had tremendous success. You look at our job numbers, you look at what's going on at the border, as we discussed before; if you look at what will be happening -- you're going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation. The numbers are staggering, how successful they've been, the military has been.
Tomorrow, as you know, I'm going to Saudi Arabia, going to Israel. I'm going to Rome. And we have the G7. We have a lot of great things going on.
So I hate to see anything that divides. I'm fine with whatever people want to do, but we have to get back to running this country really, really well. We've made tremendous progress in the last 100-some-odd days. Tremendous progress. And you see job numbers, you see all of the production that's starting. Plants starting to open again. Haven't been open in years. I'm very proud of it.
That's what I want to be focused on. Because, believe me, there's no collusion. Russia is fine. But whether it's Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America. So, thank you very much.
Well, that's true. Venezuela has a very, very serious problem. We haven't really seen a problem like that, I would say, Mr. President, in decades, in terms of the kind of violence that we're witnessing. The President was telling me -- and I knew -- that Venezuela was a very, very wealthy country, just about the wealthiest in your neck of the woods, and had tremendous strengths in so many different ways.
And now it's poverty-stricken. People don't have enough to eat. People have no food. There's great violence. And we will do whatever is necessary -- and we'll work together to do whatever is necessary -- to help with fixing that. And I'm really talking on a humanitarian level.
When you look at the oil reserves that they have, when you look at the potential wealth that Venezuela has, you sort of have to wonder, why is that happening? How is that possible? But it's been unbelievably poorly run for a long period of time. And hopefully that will change, and they can use those assets for the good and to take care of their people. Because right now what's happening is, really, a disgrace to humanity. And, Jon, I think you also had a question for the President, if you'd like to.
And that was a long and very diplomatic answer to your question. I will say it a little bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel. They work. Believe me, they work. And we have no choice. Peter Baker. Yes.
No. No. Next question.
I think it's totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so. And again, we have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We've done a fantastic job. We have a tremendous group of people. Millions and millions of people out there that are looking at what you had just said, and said, ""What are they doing?""
Director Comey was very unpopular with most people. I actually thought when I made that decision -- and I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know, from the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. But when I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision, because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side -- not only the Republican side -- they were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.
Then he had the very poor performance on Wednesday. That was a poor, poor performance. So poor, in fact, that I believe -- and you'd have to ask him, because I don't like to speak for other people -- but I believe that's why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter.
And then, on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to readjust the record, which many people have never seen before, because there were misstatements made. And I thought that was something that was terrible.
We need a great director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. It's special. All over the world, no matter where you go, the FBI is special. The FBI has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even you could say -- directly or indirectly -- with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.
We're going to have a director who is going to be outstanding. I'll be announcing that director very soon, and I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very thrilled.
And just in concluding, we look forward to getting this whole situation behind us so that when we go for the jobs, we go for the strong military, when we go for all of the things that we've been pushing so hard and so successfully, including healthcare -- because Obamacare is collapsing. It's dead; it's gone. There's nothing to compare anything to because we don't have healthcare in this country. You just look at what's happening. Aetna just pulled out. Other insurance companies are pulling out. We don't have healthcare. Obamacare is a fallacy. It's gone. We need healthcare.
We need to cut taxes. We're going to cut taxes. Forget what I want; it will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our nation. And that's what I want. It's going to bring back companies. It's going to bring back jobs. We lost so many jobs and so many companies to countries that are not so far from you, Mr. President -- they're very close to you, actually -- and to many other places throughout the world. We're going to change that. We're going to have expansion.
We already do. You look at what's happening with Ford and with General Motors in Michigan and Ohio. You look at the tremendous number of jobs that are being announced in so many different fields. That's what I'm proud of, and that's what we want to focus our energy on.
The other is something I can only tell you: There was no collusion. And everybody -- even my enemies have said, there is no collusion.
So we want to get back and keep on the track that we're on. Because the track that we're on is record-setting, and that's what we want to do, is we want to break very positive records. Thank you. You could ask a question.
Well, it's been a long process, and it's been a great thing to watch in the sense that the President did a fantastic job. That's not easy after so many years of war. So I'm very, very proud to get to know you, and I really congratulate you. There's nothing tougher than peace, and we want to make peace all over the world. And you are really a great example of somebody that started it.
I mean, FARC is -- that was a long, tough situation, as you know very well, coming from the country. But I think the President has done a magnificent job. Not easy. But he's done a magnificent job.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, thank you.

Justin Madders,United Kingdom,2020-08-20,"class=""xxmsonormal"">This is deeply concerning and shows not only how our amazing midwives go above and beyond every single day but also how they are being let down by a Government that has simply failed to deal with the chronic workforce shortages in the NHS.
class=""xxmsonormal"">We are short of 2,500 midwives in the NHS in England which, against an overall staffing shortfall of over 100,000, is forcing staff to do more and more and putting them under ever increasing strain.

John Glen,United Kingdom,2020-02-07,"The Government are establishing breathing space to help those individuals in problem debt. Today, the Government are updating the House in order to reaffirm our commitment to implementing this in 2021, as planned, and to provide figures from the impact assessment which is also published today.
Breathing space will provide a period of up to 60 days, where people in problem debt would be protected from enforcement action by their creditors and the accrual of further interest and fees on their debts.
This protection will help those in problem debt move towards a sustainable debt solution. The protections from enforcement action, fees and charges will encourage more people to seek out debt advice and to seek it earlier. It will provide them with the time and space to work with their debt adviser in an environment free from creditor pressure, in the knowledge their debt would not escalate due to further interest or charges. This will help give people the time and space they need to choose the right debt solution for them.
To ensure that breathing space works for everyone, people receiving treatment for mental health crisis will be able to enter breathing space without seeking advice from a debt adviser. They will be able to remain in breathing space for the period of their crisis treatment and a further 30 days.
In its impact assessment, the Government forecast;
700,000 people to be helped by breathing space in the first year, rising in time to over 1 million a year.
25,000 – 50,000 a year are expected to receive a breathing space via a specific route designed to support those in mental health crisis treatment.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-02-21,"Thank you very much everybody. It's a great honour to be here. This was some beautiful morning and what a job they've done, like few others have been able to do. I am very, very proud of Lonnie Bunch. The work and the love that he has in his heart for what he's done is – I was talking about you need enthusiasm, you need really love for anything you do to do it successfully and Lonnie you are, where, come on. Where's Lonnie? You should be up here, Lonnie, come on.
And David, we have to get David up here too. David Skorton is tremendous and he was singing Lonnie's praises all morning long, so you two should at least be here, so we appreciate it very much. And David Rubenstein, who's here some place, he is – come on David, you have to get up here David, you certainly deserve it. He's a very, very successful guy who spends money doing great things and he's been a great help to so many different groups, and this one in particular.
Thank you, it's a privilege to be here today. This museum is a beautiful tribute to so many American heroes. Heroes like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T Washington, Rosa Parks, the Greensboro students and the African American medal of honour recipients among so many other really incredible heroes.
It's amazing to see. I went – We did a pretty comprehensive tour but not comprehensive enough, so Lonnie I'll be back, I told you that, because I could stay here for a lot longer, believe me, it's really incredible. I'm deeply proud that we now have a museum that honours the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit.
My wife was here last week and took a tour and it was something that she's still talking about. Ivanka is here right now. Hi, Ivanka. And it really is very, very special. It's something that frankly, if you want to know the truth, it's doing so well that everybody's talking about it.
I know President Obama was here for the museum's opening last fall and I'm honoured to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum. Etched in the hall that we passed today is a quote from Spottswood Rice, a runaway slave who joined the Union army. He believed that his fellow African Americans always looked to the United States as the promised land of universal freedom.
Today and every day of my presidency, I pledge to do everything I can to continue that promise of freedom for African Americans and for every American. So important. Nothing more important.
This tour was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. The antisemitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centres are horrible and are a painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.
I want to thank a great friend of mine, Dr Ben Carson, and his beautiful family, Candy, and the whole family, for joining us today. It was very special to accompany him and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit. The first time. I love this guy. He's a great guy, really a great guy.
And he can tell you better than me but I tell you what, we really started something with Ben. We're very, very proud of him. Hopefully next week he'll get his approval, about three or four weeks late, and you're doing better than most, right? But the Democrats: they'll come along, I have no doubt they'll come along.
But Ben is going to do a fantastic job at HUD. I have absolutely no doubt he will be one of the great – ever in that position. He grew up in Detroit and had very little. He defied every statistic. He graduated from Yale and he went on to the University of Michigan's medical school. He became a brilliant, totally brilliant, neurosurgeon, saved many lives and helped many, many people.
We're going to do great things in our African American communities together. Ben's going to work with me very, very closely, and HUD has a meaning far beyond housing. If properly done, it's a meaning that's as big as anything there is, and Ben will be able to find that true meaning, and the true meaning of HUD as its secretary. I look forward to watching that. He'll do things that nobody ever thought of.
I also want to thank Senator Tim Scott for joining us today. A friend of mine, a great, great senator from South Carolina. I like the state of South Carolina. I like all those states where I won by double, double, double digits, you know, those states, but South Carolina was one. And Tim has been fantastic how he represents the people, and they love him.
I also want to profoundly thank Alveda King for being here and, as we saw her uncle's wonderful exhibit, and he certainly deserves that. Mrs King and, by the way, Miss King, I can tell you this personally because I watch her all the time, and she is a tremendous fighter for justice. So Alveda, thank you very much. I have been watching you for so long and you are so incredible and I want to thank you for all the nice things you say about me. Not everybody says nice things, but she's special.
So with that we're going to just end this incredible beginning of a morning, but engraved in the wall very nearby, a quote by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. In 1955 he told the world we are determined to work and fight until justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. And that's what it's going to be. We're going to bring this country together, maybe bring some of the world together, but we're going to bring this country together. We have a divided country. It's been divided for many, many years, but we're going to bring it together.
I hope every day of my presidency we will be honouring the determination and work towards a very worthy goal and for Lonnie and David and David and Ben and Alveda and everybody, I just have to say that what they've done here is something that can probably not be duplicated. It was done with love and lots of money, right Lonnie? Lots of money. We can't avoid that. But it was done with tremendous love and passion and that's why it's so great.
So, thank you all very much for being here, I appreciate it, and congratulations, this is a truly great museum. Thank you.

David Cameron,United Kingdom,2015-11-20,"Thank you very much indeed, and can I say what a huge honour it is for me to be aboard HMS Ark Royal, and to see you all today. I know that I am only the warm-up act, because I was speaking last night to Her Majesty – how much I love being able to say that – and she told me how delighted and excited she was about coming to see again her beloved Ark Royal as she will be next week.
I wanted to come here today for one reason, and one reason alone. I know that all of you probably think that back in the United Kingdom, all we are thinking about is eleven people who are going to take to that football pitch on Sunday. Of course, everyone is willing them on, but I can tell you that everyone in our country is thinking of something else as well, and that is the enormous debt that we owe to our armed services for everything that you do for us. Saturday is Armed Services Day, and I wanted to be here with you before that, to say to you as directly as I can how much we owe our armed services – our Air Force, our Royal Navy, our Army – for everything that you do to keep us safe.
The first thing I wanted to say is a very, very big thank you. You work incredibly long hours. You are taken away from your loved ones. You spend a long time away from home and at sea. You do a job that many of us simply couldn’t do, and it’s right that we should say a very big thank you for what you do. Samuel Johnson once said that every man looks at himself more meanly if he has never been a soldier or never been to sea, and that is right, so thank you for your courage, your dedication, your professionalism, and for what you do.
The second thing I wanted to say is that I think we should take huge pride in our Royal Navy.  Standing here on the fifth Ark Royal, and thinking of all our incredible naval history, from Nelson back to Drake, from Trafalgar to Jutland – history that I hope we can now teach properly in our schools – we should be proud of all we have achieved in the past, but we should also be very proud of all that we are going to do in the future.  We have a great naval future as well as a great naval past. I know that sometimes, with everything that has been happening in Afghanistan, that the Royal Navy can sometimes feel a little forgotten.  I will never forget what you do, and no one should ever forget that in Afghanistan, an important part of the Royal Navy, the Marine Commandos, are fighting incredibly hard in Afghanistan on our behalf.  We have heard more bad news overnight about casualties in Afghanistan, and our hearts should go out to every one of those men and their families and the loved ones that they leave behind.
As well as talking about the debt of gratitude that we owe, as well as speaking about our proud naval tradition, I also wanted to say something about the Strategic Defence Review that we are undertaking, that I know of course causes huge concern and worry right across our armed services.  It is right that we have one.  We have not asked the fundamental questions about the defence of our country, about our role in the world, since 1998.  If you think of all the things that have happened since then – the actions that you have taken part in, in Sierra Leone, and Kosovo; the wars that we fought in Iraq and Afghanistan – huge changes have taken place in our world: the attacks of 9/11; the attacks in our own country in July 2005.  It is time for us to think again about how to make our country safe, how to project power in the world, how to look after our national interest, and how to make sure we are secure for the future.  That is what we should do.
I know absolutely that the Royal Navy will have a huge role to play in that future.  We are a trading nation.  We have got to keep our sea-lanes open.  We want to stop drugs coming from our shores, and that is the work that you do.  We have to deal with the appalling threat of piracy off the Horn of Africa; that is what you do.  We have to make sure we keep vital sea-lanes open, and the work in the Gulf; that is what the Royal Navy is doing today.  I know that whatever the outcome of this review, whatever the changes we will have to make, we should make them together and recognise that the Royal Navy is going to have a huge role to play in our future, in our defence, and in our security.
The last thing I wanted to say to you today is simply this: I am very aware that as the British Prime Minister, I can expect incredible things from you.  Dedication, bravery, courage, service.  I want to say what you can expect from me.  There is this thing called the Military Covenant, written down, which is what the country offers you in return for what you offer us.  You do so much: you put your lives on the line, your safety on the line, and it is time for us to rewrite that Military Covenant, to make sure that we are doing everything we can for you and your families at home, whether it is the schools you send you children to, whether it is the healthcare that you can expect, whether it is the fact that there should be a dedicated military ward for anyone who gets injured or wounded in Afghanistan or elsewhere.  I want all of these things refreshed and renewed and written down in a new Military Covenant that we write into the law of our land so we show how we stand up for our armed services.
As far as I am concerned, public service is a vital part of our country, and you are at the noblest end of public service.  A great military commander once said that those things we do for ourselves, die with us; those things we do in the service of others, they live forever.  That is what you do in the Royal Navy; that is what you do in our armed services.  I am here as the new British Prime Minister to say a very big thank you for your service, your dedication, your courage and all that you do on this historic ship, in this great place, at this time, with Her Majesty the Queen coming to see you next week.
Thank you for all you do, thank you for all you are, thank you for all you represent, and recognise that back home in Britain, it is not just the government that reveres our armed services; it is the whole of our country, from the homecoming parades, to the businesses that allow Territorial Army reservists and other reservists to go off to sea or to fight overseas, to the great public support you see for our armed services.  We are proud of you, so thank you, and remember you are never forgotten.  Thank you very much.
",2010 Speech on HMS Ark Royal,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2010-speech-on-hms-ark-royal/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-02-23,"Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have everybody. And some of the great people in the world of business, many of you I know -- many of you I know from reading all of our wonderful magazines and business magazines, in particular. So it's an honor to have you with us today.
Bringing manufacturing back to America, creating high-wage jobs was one of our campaign promises and themes, and it resonated with everybody. It was really something what happened. States that hadn't been won in many, many years were -- they came over to our fold. A lot of it had to do with the jobs, and other reasons -- but jobs. And I'm delivering on everything that we've said. In fact, people are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency. We've delivered on a lot. And I think Mark can explain, and Mark can probably say some of the things we're doing for the auto industry. We're going to be doing for many of the industries.
As you know, the United States lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. That's an unbelievable number and statistic. And 70,000 factories closed since China joined the WTO -- 70,000 factories. So when I used to give that statistic, I used to talk about and I always thought it was a typo. I said, it has to be a typo. I tell Wilbur -- Wilbur, that can't be right -- 70,000. Think of it, 70,000 factories. So you say, what are we doing? My administration's policies and regulatory reform, tax reform, trade policies will return significant manufacturing jobs to our country. Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back, the good jobs, the real jobs. They've left, and they're coming back. They have to come back.
You've already seen companies such as Intel, Ford. Mark has been great. GM, Walmart, Amgen, Amazon, Fiat -- they came the other day; they're going to make a tremendous investment in the country. Carrier and many others announced significant new investments in the United States. For example, Ford is doing 700 million in Michigan, creating 700 new jobs -- is a vote of confidence. It was actually stated a vote of confidence. We have many other companies doing the same thing. Carrier, as you know -- and I got involved very late, almost like by two years late -- but many of the jobs that were leaving for Mexico, they're bringing back at least 800 jobs they're bringing back. And they actually never got to leave. I have no idea what they did with the plant in Mexico, but we'll have to ask them, because it was largely built.
General Motors is investing $1 billion in U.S. plants, adding or keeping 7,000 jobs. And it's going to be investing a lot more than that over the next fairly short period. Lockheed Martin has -- they've just announced 1,800 new jobs, and U.S. plants are doing a great job, and we started negotiating with them a little bit on the F-35. They cut their price a little bit. Thank you very much. She's tough. And I think I have to say this: Marillyn, you've gotten a lot of credit, because what you did was the right thing. So we appreciate it. She cut her price over $700 million, right? By over $700 million. You think Hillary would have asked for $700 million. But you know what? You're going to do great and you're going to make more planes. It's going to work out the same, or better.
Walmart announced plans to create 10,000 jobs, and all of those jobs are going to be in the United States. Sprint and SoftBank is putting in $50 billion because of our election in the United States, over the next four years, to create 50,000 jobs. They've been terrific, by the way. And we have many others. Many of you are in the room, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. We have many, many other companies. And we're very happy.
Today we have 24 CEOs from the largest manufacturing companies in the country and even in the world. They represent people just in this room, nearly $1 trillion of sales and 2 million employees, large majorities of which are in the United States. They share our commitment to bringing manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country, which has been the biggest part of my campaign. I would say the border, a big part. Military strength, big part. And jobs, big part. I don't want to say which is most important. I guess we always have to say defense is maybe the most important.
But many of you take care of our defense, you make great products. Nobody makes the products that we do for our military. Nobody. And, in fact, a couple of countries who were not allowed to buy from us, I gave them -- hello, Jeff -- I gave them authorization -- you can only buy from us. I want them to buy from us. They were getting planes from other countries because our -- and they're allies. But they're going to be buying from us from now on.
And I just want to thank all of my people. My staff has been amazing. Gary, as you know -- you all know Gary from Goldman, Gary Cohn. And we're really happy -- just paid $200 million in tax in order to take this job, by the way. But he's great. And he'll be criticized by the media because he's getting paid $197,000. They'll say he really wanted that money -- which he gave up. I think he gave up -- did you give that up, Gary? I think so.
It was one of those things. That's right.
I want to thank -- Wilbur has been so fantastic. I've known Wilbur for so long, and he's a great guy, great negotiator, but a very fair negotiator. And he's going to be doing things that -- the deals we have with other countries are unbelievably bad. We don't have any good deals. In fact, I'm trying to find a country where we actually have a surplus of trade as opposed to -- everything is a deficit.
With Mexico, we have $70 billion in deficits, trade deficits, and it's unsustainable. We're not going to let it happen. Can't let it happen. We're going to have a good relationship with Mexico, I hope. And if we don't, we don't. But we can't let that happen -- $70 billion in trade deficits. And that doesn't include the drugs that pour across the border, like water. So we can't let that happen.
With China, we have close to a $500-billion trade deficit. So we have to do something. I spoke to the President, I spoke to many people. We're going to work on that very, very hard, and we're going to do things that are the proper things to do.
But I actually said to my people: Find a country where we actually do well. So far, we haven't found that country. It's just losses with everybody, and we're going to turn that around.
I want to thank Jared Kushner, who has been so involved in this, and all of my guys. We have a great team. We have a team of all-stars. And we've been credit -- we've really been given credit for that. Right now, Rex, who, as you know, he's in Mexico -- I said, that's going to be a tough trip, because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico. That's going to be a tough trip. But he's over there with General Kelly, who's been unbelievable at the border. You see what's happening at the border. All of a sudden for the first time we're getting gang members out, we're getting drug lords out. We're getting really bad dudes out of this country and at a rate that nobody has ever seen before. And they're the bad ones.
And it's a military operation because what has been allowed to come into our country -- when you see gang violence that you've read about like never before and all of the things -- much of that is people that are here illegally. And they're rough and they're tough, but they're not tough like our people. So we're getting them out.
I thought what we could do is maybe we'll start with Ken on my left, and we'll go around the room and introduce yourselves to the press. Lots of media. One thing, we have lots of media. How are you? Treats me -- that's one that treats me very nicely, one of the few. Hi. And we'll just start around -- go around the room and then we'll talk privately without the press, and we're going to figure out how to bring many, many millions of jobs more back to the United States, okay?
Ken, go ahead.
Good soup.
Did you bring any more of those jobs back from Carrier. People are buying Carrier because of what you did -- bringing the jobs back to Indiana.
Right? So, I said that. I thought that was going to happen. Good. Thank you.
I love those D10s. Are they still doing the D12?
Because the D12, I'm waiting for, you know. That's going to be bigger than anything ever in history, right? But there's nothing like what you do. The Caterpillars are the best.
And when we raise the dollar, and we let other people manipulate their currencies, it's the one thing that stops you, Doug -- right?
Right, technology. No, but we have to give you a level playing field.
We have to let other countries give you a level playing field. So, what a great company. I love Caterpillar. I've been driving them for a long time.
Okay, good. I might do that soon. Go ahead.
And you're going to be doing pipelines now. You know that, right? We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota. But they have to buy -- meaning, steel, so I'll say U.S. Steel -- but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country.
So the pipe is coming from the U.S.
Good. I'll do it. I'll be out there.
Yep, good.
Good. Well, thank you, and thank you for what we did. Lot 10, we call it. Lot 10 -- 90 planes. It was 90 planes out of 3,000, but it was not doing so well, and now it's doing great. Right?
Okay, good.
Good. Very good. Thank you, Marillyn.
Good. Hi, Jeff.
Jeff actually watched me make a hole-in-one, can you believe that? Should you tell that story?
Crazy.
. And then I got a hole-in-one.
So, it was sort of cool. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Absolutely. Thank you.
Great.
Great. Bob Craft is a big fan of yours. You know, that right?
Yes, I know.
Good. We will.
And I want to thank you for your help. You've been great. Thank you, Andrew, very much.
Nobody knows Ivanka.
Thank you. Reed, thank you also. Thank you. Say it again, please.
Yes. Great company.
Hi, Michael. Nice to see you.
Great.
Great. Great companies.
Jared. So, Jared, maybe I'll let you take over for a little while, and we'll then -- we're going to then go through the room very, very carefully. We're going to find out how we bring more jobs back. And thank you to the press and the media. We really appreciate it, and we'll see you later. Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-05-13,"That's true.
Thank you.
Well, I think it was great. I mean, we did a tremendous amount of work -- natural-gas going to China, cattle going to China. We opened it up. You remember, years ago where they really stopped any cattle from being sold into China, and now China's just opened it up to our farmers, and our, our cattle folks, and they're very very happy about it. So, we have a tremendous amount of things happening literally today.
Well, there's no right time. Let's say I did it on January 20th, the opening, right then. That would have been the big story as opposed to the inauguration, and I was thinking about it then. I was thinking about it during this period of time. There's really no right time to do it. But, uh, I mean I'm ok with it, as you know. I have the decision to make, and I have to make the decision. Donald Trump
He agrees that I have the absolute right to do it. Everybody agrees. I guess I was a little bit surprised because all the Democrats, I mean, they hated Jim Comey. They didn't like him. They wanted him fired or whatever, and... and then all of a sudden they come out with these glowing reports. You know, look, it's, it's politics.
It's true. Number one, they're hypocrites. But it's beyond being a hypocrite. You have these tremendous... the level of hatred toward him, especially during that period of time with Hillary Clinton, where he gave her a free ride. I mean he gave her a free pass like nobody's ever, ever gotten, a free pass. And during that period of time, the level of hatred by the Democrats -- also the Republicans, to be honest -- because, you know, first she got a free pass, and then he came out with Comey two, and then he came out with Comey three, and the ultimate thing is he gave her a free pass, so they should have liked him.
Well, they should have liked him, but because he did what he did for her was unbelievable, with all of the guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty -- and then he goes, uh but she's not guilty. The fact is, that we're on to other things, and we had the right to do it. We made it. There is no good time to do it, Jeanine. What I'm most proud about is what's happening with the country.
You look at jobs are way up, you look at what we're doing in terms of trade deals. It's going to be unbelievable, the trade deals we're making for this country. We have the worst trade deals ever made by any country, anywhere, and we're making them into great deals. The business that we're now reopening with China, that's been gone for many, many years -- especially when you look at natural gas, and especially when you look at... the deal we just made on cattle, it's really something special.
And we're doing very well with health care. By the way. Well, it wasn't really an initial failure. It was just a continuation of a negotiation.
But we're doing very... I think we're doing very well with that. Now, that's before the Senate and I think the Senate is going to come up with some really, really great additions and changes and we're going to have a plan that's going to be really great. And by the way, Obamacare is dead. It's dying. I've been saying that for a long time. Now, Aetna just pulled out, the big insurance company just pulled out, and we have to come up with a plan because Obamacare is dead.
I agree, but I will also say they're great people. I made so many friends. I read one story where this was like an indoctrination of Trump, because I didn't know a lot. You know, I was in business and I didn't know a lot of these Congressmen and Congresswomen.
They're great people. I met so many people that I really like, and it was very intense. You know, a lot of people are saying I wonder if Trump is very much involved. I was speaking to 30, 40, 50 a day. I got to know a lot of them really well, and they're great people. There... there... we have wonderful people representing this country, I can tell you.
Well, they're obstructionist. I mean what they want to do is obstruct and delay, and I'm actually very surprised with Chuck Schumer, because I know him. I've known him for a long time. I cannot... I really am surprised that he's become such... you know he's gone so far left in order to get into the Elizabeth Warren group that I think he's hurting himself. I think he's hurting the Democrats very badly, but he has really been brought to the left. And I also don't think they can win any more elections unless they start changing their tune.
But they become very obstructionist, and all that means is delay and all of the things that they do and, you know, we're going to end up winning. We've been winning. We won, and now you look, we have the House, we have the Senate. Don't forget, before the election the Republicans were going to lose the Senate, they're going to lose the house and they're going to lose, of course, the presidency, and that was two weeks before the election.
I was watching your show, and you were like... not happy. I have to say, I know you're fair and balanced and all of that stuff. But you weren't exactly thrilled by the numbers that you were seeing, and that last two to three-week period was sort of amazing, what was going. Because you started seeing very good... numbers started...
But... but the point is, that we were supposed to lose all three. And not only do we lose all three, they said it will be perhaps the greatest election failure in the history of this country. And I said well that's bad. But I worked very hard, and we ended up winning all three instead of losing all three.
And it became one of the great successes. I will tell you, and I think they're doing even better than that...
I agree, I agree, I agree. I think...
Well, that is an interesting situation. I actually said today, let's not ever do any more press briefings. You know they're getting tremendous ratings, and the especially the fake media, there... they're going crazy, they are going crazy. And they'll be in the room, and you have to see the way they ask questions, I want I want... screaming, and there's never been anything like this to get like a question out.
And in all fairness to Sean, and in all fairness to Sara Huckabee, and in all fairness to anybody that stood up there, they don't know me. I'm a very active president. I'm doing like, I'm dealing with China, I'm dealing with Japan, I'm dealing with North Korea, I'm dealing with all of these different things. Russia came in to see me, the Foreign Minister the other day, and right after that, they didn't say this, but right after that the Foreign Minister from Ukraine came in. I said, fellas you got to make peace, you got to get peace. They only talked about Russia coming in, okay?
And we took pictures, they took pictures. We released the pictures, they made a big deal out of it. Everybody knew he was coming, and he was scheduled to come. But they didn't talk about Ukraine. The point is this: when we have those press conferences, I actually said we shouldn't have them, because Sara Huckabee said...
No, but listen, no no. But there's never been action like this. This is crazy. I mean, we're getting higher ratings...
We're getting higher ratings on those press conferences...
No, we'd do it in a different way.
We'd do it, we'd do it through a piece of paper, with a perfectly accurate, beautiful answer. I'll give you an example.
They are asked 100 questions, or 50 questions, or 20 questions. If they get one out of fifty, just a little bit off, 5%, 10%, 20%, it's... the next day it's a front-page story in every newspaper.
Now, press conferences weren't even covered for Obama practically. They were on C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, when you know, there was nothing going on.
But wait a minute, my press... these press conferences are like the biggest thing on daytime television.
Okay, you see the ratings, they're blowing away everything on just about... everything on daytime television. What I'd love to do is stop them. It's not fair to the people. I'll give you... look, I am a very active person. I have a lot of very positive things going on right up here for this country. It's impossible for a person or two people or three people who are press people, to cover every aspect of what I'm thinking, and what I'm doing, and I think it's unfair. And if they get it just a little bit wrong, they don't mean to, they're liars. They're liars. They're horrible people. They're liars, the press goes, and it becomes a big story for two days or three days, and it's very, very unfair to a person in that job
I think that's really a tough job to be on, especially for me because I'm having meeting after meeting. I'm cutting the price of the airplanes with Lockheed. I'm cutting the price of airplanes with Boeing. I'm doing all of these things. I'm making deals for China... with China. I'm trying to solve a problem in North Korea, which by the way, is a really big problem.
Yes, that's true.
Maybe we don't have press conferences, and we do...
What... just don't have them, unless I have every two weeks and I do myself. We don't have them. I think it's a good idea. First of all, you have a level of hostility that's incredible, and it's very unfair. Sarah Huckabee is a lovely young woman. You know, Sean Spicer, he is a wonderful human being. He's a nice man.
Yeah, he is, sure.
Well, he's doing a good job, but he gets beat up...
Yeah, well, he's been there from the beginning. I mean...
No, he just gets beat up by these people, and again, you know, they don't show the 90 questions that they asked and answered properly. I'm saying if they're off just a little bit, just a little bit, it's a big story.
And, and, here's the thing. The difference between me and another President, another president -- I won't use names -- but another President doesn't do what I'm doing. They really don't. I'm not saying that in a bragging way. I'm not saying it in any way. Another President Jeanine will sit in the Oval Office and do practically nothing all day. I'm doing every minute of the day. I'm doing something. I'm cutting prices up, whether this nation has such unbelievable potential. The thing is they can't keep up with it, and I'll be honest, they do their best. If they give an answer, and if it's a little bit off, they're liars and horrible things.
It's really unfair. I would... I would recommend we don't have it.
Over the next couple of weeks. I'll tell you what, they'll be very unhappy because the ratings are so high, that I don't know what these networks are going to do. They're going to start to cry.
They get the free ratings because of me, and yet they don't treat us fairly.
I know. Corey Booker ought to get his address right, where he lived, when he ran for Mayor. That's what he ought to do.
Check it out. Check out the old publicity.
By fake news.
I am not convinced. Clapper is convinced, other people are convinced.
Everybody is convinced, they say there is no collusion. You know the expression? They're all saying, there is no collusion. There is no collusion.
Well, I'd like it to move fast, if possible. But I'll tell you what I really want... There is no collision. We had nothing to do with Russia, and everything else, but there is a question. Was it Russia... who was it that went in and tried to hack? Now...
There are other questions too Jeanine, why didn't the DNC, the Democrats, why didn't they allow the FBI to check their server. They wouldn't allow them to check.
And why didn't the FBI insist on checking this?
They have very powerful subpoenas, so Podesta -- who, by the way has a company with his brother, as I understand it, in Russia -- I mean those are the ones they should be checking. But with all of that being said, what I want and I think it's very important... I want to get to the bottom, if Russia or anybody else is trying to tamper or play with our election. To me that is very important.
You're right. Well, you're right but all it is is more time. I'll tell you what, you have it before two -- you have it before the House and you have it before the Senate.
I know some of the people on those Commissions are highly -- they're very ethical people, very talented, very smart people. I think let them just do it. You know, they've been doing it for a long time. I'd love to see...
Well, I think it's been proved already, and to be honest with you, I want it to be accurate also. I want them...
...to devote the time they need. I'd like it to go fast, but more important to me, much more than speed. I want them to be sure that Russia or anybody else, that if it did happen, if there was any -- and everybody also agrees by the way it didn't change the election...
It didn't change the vote. So that's important. That's important to me. But I don't want it ever to be even a question again. So if it takes longer, let it take longer, but let them do the job right.
I know. Well I'll give you an example.
I mean, we made... we made that incredible deal with China last night at 11 o'clock, right? And the front page of the papers had more to do with unimportant stories than that, okay? And I think that's very unfair...
But that's the way... Well I think it's going to be off the table as soon as they announce the result. Hopefully they announce the result quickly. I'd like to see it quick, but it would all due respect I want to see it done properly. I don't want to be in a position where something took place having to do with Russia -- or any other country or any other person -- who knows, but I don't want to be in a position where it's not done correctly. So let them do it correctly. Let them take their time.
...to do it correctly. I'm talking about the House, the Senate, the FBI...
I don't think you need it. I mean honestly, whatever's going to do the best, but I don't think you need it.
I see, I see a lot of things.
I know.
I know, and you don't read about it the way you should. That's on page ten.
Can I be honest with you? I think the people are seeing it though, Jeanine?
I think the people, you know, I have a very strong base of incredible people. I think they know what's going on. I had dinner with a group last night that, just great people, great friends. And they come in and they're very angry about what's going on. They're angry from the other... from our standpoint. They're very angry about what's going on. I think that people see it. I think the people see our successes.
Hey look, putting the Supreme Court judge on within a hundred days, and I don't mean just nominating, having him confirmed, and he's going to be great. And so many other things. We've done, you know... they said we did no legislative work. We signed 32 bills. Jeanine, did you hear that? 32 bills, and they were saying a couple of weeks ago, during the hundred days we signed none. Not everybody was saying that, but some were saying it.
We signed 32 bills. That means went through Congress and signed it. In addition, we freed up this system which was all glued up, so the people can build houses and they can build factories, and they can build so much. Our trade deals are about to come, they're going to be unbelievable. I mean, we're doing things... and I honestly believe that people see it, but there's no question, it would be wonderful to go fast, but I want it to be done right.
Yes.
To me that's one of most exciting questions you can ask, if you want to know the truth.
We have some great candidates. We're interviewing people. We're going to pick somebody who is outstanding. That's what we want to get.
I want loyalty to the country. I mean, I want loyalty to the United States of America. I want him to do a good job, or her to do a great job.
I think we have some wonderful candidates.
No, I don't think... I read, I read that article. I don't think it's inappropriate, number one.
No, no I didn't. But I don't think that's a bad question to ask. I think loyalty to the country, loyalty to the United States is important. You know, it depends on how you define loyalty, number one. Number two, I don't how that got there, because, I didn't ask that question.
That I can't talk about that. I won't talk about that. All I want is for Comey to be honest and I hope he will be. I'm sure he will be. I hope.
I'll tell you, we have a lot of choice. Everybody wants the position. It's a great position to have and we have extremely capable people, in some cases, people of, you know, great prestige, actually. People of, who have had tremendous careers would like to do it.
We gonna have somebody fantastic.
Fairly quickly.
I think we, I think we owe it to the public to do it fairly quickly.
Yes. Oh yeah. I want to pick somebody that can be confirmed. Look, I thought this would be a very popular thing that I did when I terminated Comey. Because, all of the Democrats couldn't stand him. But because I terminated him, they said, ahh, we'll get political points. We'll go against Trump. So, I assumed it would be fairly popular, and they got together and said, again, we're talking obstruction.
This is total obstruction. Uh, they got together and they, all of a sudden, they love... you know, it's sort of funny, when you listen to Schumer and you listen to the other people talking about Comey, but then you back a few months and you get their statements from a few months ago... and they, they couldn't stand him. So it is very interesting think.
It's pretty tough to work with him. I'm surprised, because I've known him for a long time.
Again, he's gonna very, very far left. He does not have good control of his party. He is not a good leader. I think it will be tough for me to work with him. We'll see. Hopefully what will happen is in '18, we gonna elect some Republican senators, because only have a margin now of two. We're gonna elect people, some people, some more Republicans and we will be able to do it without having to go through that situation with Schumer. Because, honestly, they just want to stop things, they want to clog up the wheels and we cannot let that happen.
That's what they want to do.
They should have been stopped a long time ago. They should have been stopped by Obama. They should have been stopped from before Obama.
I remember when Clinton wrote in his book about the wonderful deal they made with North Korea. They started making missiles the next day and nuclear the next day.
I can't talk to about that, but I think we're having some very, very good thoughts.
Are you going to build that wall?
We're going to build the wall, absolutely. Is there question about that? There's no question about it. We're going to build the wall.
Right, sure. Horrible group of people.
Yeah.
We are sweeping them the hell out of the country. They are being swept out of the country so fast. You know, we go into to towns like in Long Island, I grew up, essentially on Long Island.
...and we go into towns that I have known, and the towns are living in fear. They're like occupied camps.
And General Kelly goes in with his guys, and they are tough, too. They are tougher, believe me. This MS-13, somebody said they are the equivalent of Al-Qaeda in terms of their mentality and toughness. And we go into to towns and the people are cheering as we take these people and throw them into the vans. They're cheering. It is almost like they have been freed or liberated. This is in the United States. And under Obama, they were just pouring in. So, MS-13, we have thousands of them in this country. They are going very, very fast.
Yes.
Rome, right. And then we are going to the big, the big conference of our countries that we want to help the world. But we are...
I think we are going to accomplish a lot of things. We've established great relationships with a lot different countries that frankly we didn't have. You know, one thing I did is Aya. You know about Aya?
Young girl, who was in an Egyptian prison. President Obama worked three and a half years to try and get her out. He was unable to get her out. I had a meeting with General El-Sisi of Egypt and within one minute, we made an agreement and she was released. She was there... going to be there for 28 years. She is a wonderful young person. And I will tell you, I was very honored by what General El-Sisi did. Not only her, but her husband out and a total of eight people out. They were going to be there for many, many years in an Egyptian prison.
The past administration worked on it for three years, three and half years to be exact. They were unable to do a thing. I got them out in less than one minute. And That's what we need.
I hope that they understand it. I hope that they see it. Again, this was a... a plan to... because, this was just an excuse that the Democrats came up with for losing an election. They lost an election, they lost it badly, and this was just an excuse for losing the election, and I think people are seeing through it. I really do. I believe people see through it.
We do, to a lesser extent, because of the time and the busy. I'm very.. I tell you what, I am really going at it. I'm busy from early in the morning...
until late at night, because I took over a mess. This was a mess, whether it's trade or whether it's Obamacare, which is so disastrous, or whether it's any one of so many things I could name. I took over a mess, so I don't have much time, but we do do it as much as possible.
He'd be very proud. He had a very profound impact on my life, and I learned a lot from Fred, and he'd be very proud. He was a great guy.
He had... He had a whole.... He's telling me just keep doing what you're doing, because we're having a great impact. We're going to have, I think, I would love to say one of the truly great impacts of any President on the lives and the betterment of lives of the people of this nation. Fred would be looking down and he would say keep going. And I would tell you if it were different, if I thought he would be looking down and say you can do better here or there. I think he'd be very proud of the things that we've accomplished, having to do with everything from jobs to the military, to the borders -- you see what's happening on the borders.
To frankly we're going to have to solve some big problems, like the North Korea problem that we've been talking about, but I think he'd be very proud all right.
Thank you.
Thank you very much Jeanine
Thank you. Thank you.
",Interview: Jeanine Pirro of Fox News Interviews Donald Trump at The White House,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-fox-news-judge-jeanine-may-13-2017
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-07-25,"Thank you everybody, great honor. It's a great honor, great state. I have a lot of property. I have a lot of people in Virginia, pay a lot of checks, being every night, every day. A lot of great success I've had in Virginia over the years and we have just phenomenal stuff. In Loudoun County, as you know, and we have down in Charlottesville and some other stuff.
Tremendous, tremendous beautiful property. Charlottesville is right next to Thomas Jefferson. Who is an architect. You know, he had great taste. He had great taste. He understood that some of the most beautiful land I've ever seen. So I love Virginia and we are going to win Virginia. We're going to win Virginia.
I'm going to go over some of these statistics when Tim Kaine was governor. They're not pretty. They're not pretty. I always knew.
. Not good. But she just got fired. I said, ""Debbie, you're fired. Get out, Debbie. Out, boom."" Boy. How about that for disloyalty though in terms of Hillary Clinton? In all fairness, because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton and as for -- this is why these politicians, folks.
Other than Mike Pence, of course he's great. He's great. But these politicians -- hey, look, look, look. So there's no loyalty there, right? There's no loyalty. None whatsoever. It gets a little heat and they fire her. Get out of here, get out of here first. She knew what was going on. Hillary Clinton knew what was going on. She knew everything that was going on. She knew it's a rigged system that Bernie Sanders never had a chance.
OK? He never had a chance. And if you look at it, look what's going on, they're having a lot of people marching now. A lot of those people going to vote for us. I'll tell you right now. A lot of them. And not even because they like me or they don't like me, although I have to say, ""Have you seen the polls that just came out from?"" Right?
We had like the biggest bounce that anyone can remember. They said, ""Well, if he gets out of the convention, with no bounce, that will be a success."" Do we have nine points or something, 10 points? We're leading. We're actually leading in the polls. And the CNN poll was so good, I may have to start liking them again.
I don't know. No, they treat me unfairly. But you know, what's more important? The poll. But you know, the big poll? The big poll, that's November 8. That's the poll we care about. Right? But look, how disloyal Crooked Hillary Clinton was to somebody that put her life on the line. I mean, she, what she did, in order to take advantage of Bernie Sanders and all of the supporters.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, what she did in order to make sure that the system, the rigged system stays intact and Hillary gets it. And then you see the e-mails. Can you imagine? They talked about religion. They talk about religion. I'd right now be on the front page of every newspaper.
It would be horrible. And they're trying to play it down. Well, that wasn't so bad. That wasn't so bad. No, but could you imagine? Seriously, there's such a different standard. So here's the story, here's the story. So Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary. And Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take her more than five minutes to make that decision.
Man, I don't want her covering my back. I'll tell you right now. It's true. It's true. Now, the other thing I'm surprised at, you know, it's nice when you're not reading speeches. Isn't it? Really? Because I can talk about current events. This stuff happened 10 minutes ago. You know, if you're reading speeches, I see these guys.
I dealt with a lot of them. I've actually been a very political person all my life. I've always been on the other side. But now, for 14 months I've been doing this and I like this side in a certain way better because we can do things better. They used to love me when I was just a contribute. I'd give millions of dollars, just I was a contributor.
Now, I know we not -- I -- I like this better. I like. I like being not establishment better. But with Bernie, when you look at what happened, the thing that surprises me most is how we folded. He folded. I thought he was really hanging out tough, tough, tough. Then they find these horrible e-mails talking about his religion and is he Jewish and is he an atheist and water.
That's not going to play well and sir -- Man, that's rough. And that's not as bad as some of the other ones. And I said, there's no way that Bernie Sanders shows up to make a speech. There's no way that he can ever endorse Crooked Hillary Clinton anymore. Right? There's no way. And today, I see him trying to make the case and his own people are out there booing.
OK? They're out there booing. So it's pretty bad. Then I'll tell you, Hillary Clinton -- I've been saying this for a long time and I got it from Bernie Sanders because he said, ""She suffers from bad judgment."" Right? Bad judgment. She suffers from very bad judgment. Her instincts are bad, they're no good.
Her instincts are defective. Her instincts are defective. But she's got -- she's low energy. She actually has low energy. She'll go home, she'll take a nap for four or five hours and she'll come back. No naps for Trump, no nap. I don't take naps. We don't have time. We don't have time. You ever see Hillary?
Where she comes out and she read a teleprompter for a little while and then she go home. You don't see her for three or four days and then she comes back. And then they used to. I remember, in Iowa, where they put like three or four people, really nice people in there. Sitting around a little table and everyone saying, ""Well, I'd like to ask her a question.
No, no, no, you're too tough."" This is what we have. How do you think ISIS is going to react? I -- I don't think so, right? I don't think so. Not going to be good. Now we have tough enemies out there. We have tough, mean, vicious, horrible, horrible people. These are horrible, horrible human beings. We need toughness, folks.
It's about time. We need strength, we need toughness, we need smarts, we need warmth, we need compassion, we need everything. We need everything. But we don't need somebody that goes home and takes snaps. We don't need naps. But what did surprise me, was that Bernie, was so soft on this. I really -- I was amazed because I watched his speech, you know.
We must vote for Hillary Clinton. I -- I mean, the hatred he's got, but why would he do that? He looks better if he didn't do it, to me. Hey, what do I have to do with it? I don't care. Whatever he wants to do. But could you imagine, if what's taking place now with the Democrats took place in Cleveland? And by the way, I have to tell you, Cleveland did an amazing job.
Thank you Ohio. Thank you Cleveland. What a job? I spoke to the police chief, Calvin, did a phenomenal job up there. But what we had and the Secret Service, working with the Secret Service. What a job they did? But Cleveland's a beautiful place. I mean, really, I was so happy. We had no problems. They we're trying to show.
I know they showed this one square, where there's big square and then a few people. They bring the cameras enclose, you know, really. Because they don't want to show all that beautiful grass or you know, with no people on. And -- and you know why? I'll tell you why? Because people like our message. People like our message.
They really liked it. And if you look at Philadelphia, I went to school in Philadelphia. I love Philadelphia. If you look at Philadelphia, what they're going through right now, looks like a lot of people. It's 100 degrees out. And speaking of that, by the way, I don't know if you saw it. Did you know I went to the other room?
So you have a second room and then outside you have over a thousand people and it's 104 degrees out. Now, think of it. And it's the first time I ever did it. I said, ""Let's go. Let's go to the second room first."" Right? That's the anteroom. But let's go because it's the overflow room, I said. So I went in there, we surprised them, we were nice.
But you know, I will love these people. But you know, what I also like? I don't have to do it later. And outside, we have a lot of people and I wish they'd let them in. The fire department won't let them in because of a fire regulation. Which is very sad because they're outside. It's -- it's -- we have speakers out there.
I think the speakers are burning up, folks. It is hot. I wish the fire marshal -- where's the fire marshal? Is he around here? Come on fire marshal. If they could get in, fire marshal. You know, you have doors that go right out to the outside. I promise there's nothing like you don't have a problem. I feel badly.
We have those people, we have people standing outside. You could get a few more people inside. If they could, let them in. So that's the way a builder would talk. OK? That's the way a builder would talk. So you had the firing of the head of the DNC and that was a vicious firing. A lot of things happened, you had her firing.
Hillary Clinton's total disloyalty was at play. It really was. People don't say that. They won't say that on and the media. Oh, if I did something with Reince -- can you imagine if I fired Reince? I wouldn't do that because Reince has done such a great job. Reince Priebus. What a job he has done. And I always used to say, for months now I've been saying, I'll take Reince over Debbie.
And everyone said, ""Oh, but Debbie is a superstar."" I said, ""So is Reince."" And then it turned out that Debbie flamed out and she's gone but the disloyalty was incredible. And I really mean that, because honestly, whether you like her or not, she worked very hard to rig the system, so that Hillary got it. It's true, right?
It's true. Though it's true. She worked very, very hard to rig the system. Little did she know that China, Russia, one of our many, many friends came in and hacked the hell out of us. Can you imagine? Can you imagine, what they're hacking? I guarantee, we'll find the 33,000 emails. Why did Hillary get rid of her middle name?
Huh. Hillary. Now, why did she get rid of it? Hillary Rotten Clinton, Rotten Clinton. Hillary Rotten Clinton, right? Maybe that's why, it's too close. No, no, it's too close. It's too close. You think Mike Pence would say this? I don't think so. By the way, did I do a good job with Mike Pence? OK? All right?
Him and his family, what a high quality person. You know, you have to vet people, right? And we vetted Mike and they came back and these are killers. And they came back with many pages on certain people. OK? Many pages. I oh, I would like to read a book. Many, many pages. With Mike, they came back with like nothing.
He's like, the most perfect human being, this guy. I said, ""Mike, did you ever do anything wrong in your whole life?"" ""No, I don't think so."" He is -- where is he? He is the best guy. That guy is right. I love this guy. I love him. I love him. But you know what I really like about Mike? So listen to this, to me, a very important thing is her bad judgment.
Now, whether you like her choice. Tim Kaine, nobody even knows who he is. He's done a terrible job for Virginia. I assumed, they said, ""Oh, he picked it."" You know, he got picked because of Virginia because Virginia is very important and I'm doing very well here. Hey, hey, I'm employing a lot of people here and they don't employ anybody.
I spent a lot of money, in Potomac Falls, Sterling, that area. I mean, I spent a lot of money. We have great, great things happening. Next year we have the senior PGA championship coming thousands and thousands of people come into Virginia and spend a lot of money. Thank you. I love you too darling. But -- but just think of it. So Hillary Clinton has almost the 50% of the people want a progressive.
OK, we don't have to like that but that's OK. That's where they are. They want to give everything away and raise your taxes. That's what happens. No, no. She will have a tax raise -- by the way, I have the largest tax cut of anybody running for office, Republican or Democrat. OK? But Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton will have a tax cut that is not there.
It's going to be a tax cut times 20 in reverse like a rocket ship. We have the biggest tax cut, proposed. I guess, in the last four years and it's -- were going to get it through. At least, we're gonna get most of it through. I'll tell you what? I'm going to try and get all of it through. But we have and it's policy, it's -- you know, put out there.
That doesn't mean there's not a little negotiation because we're going to have to negotiate, but we're going to have it go. Hillary Clinton is going to have one of the biggest tax's increases in the history of our country because what she's proposing, you're going to have to pay for. A very simple. Very simple.
Now, maybe she'll, you know, after she gets rid of Bernie, get rid of all this stuff. OK. It doesn't help you, by the way. But what she's proposing, she needs to have a massive, massive tax increase. Now, nobody ever talks about that. Do you notice? She never talks about, who's going to pay for it? Now they're going to pay.
But just statistically, she's going to need a very major tax cut. But here's something to me that's very interesting. 50% of that party is Bernie Sanders, almost. And they're very passion and that's a much more passionate side. Her people, they fall asleep. OK? They fall asleep. They're watching her. With Bernie's people, they're really out there.
They've -- say, would you want about Bernie Sanders. He got it on free trade. He got it. Free trade, now, I'm a -- I'm totally -- I'm a free trader. I believe in free trade. You know, they get it all wrong because they just don't say it properly. But I want smart trade. I want -- I want to trade with other countries but I don't want to lose $500 billion a year with China.
Thank you China. We love you very much but we're not going to lose $500 billion. And I don't want to have a -- a trade imbalance with Japan. Where they send us millions of cars and we send them some beef. And then they send it back, right? And then they -- we send some wheat. Wheat. They send cars, we said wheat.
It sounds like, we're going to send a lot of wheat. Right? The trade imbalance is massive. And with Mexico, we have an unbelievably big trade amount. So they kill us at the border, they kill us, they're killing us at the border. And we have one of the biggest trade imbalances and what happens? What happens?
I'm not even including the drugs, right? The drugs are pouring across. You know, I won the state of New Hampshire and I got very, very friendly with the people in New Hampshire. I'll never forget them because that's an amazing group of people. And I said, ""What's your biggest problem?"" They said, ""Heroin.
Pouring across the southern border."" I said, ""Heroin? New Hampshire?"" Because you look at New Hampshire, it's so beautiful, with the lakes and the little beautiful roads and the trees and the forests. I say, ""You don't have heroin. I think you have."" They said, ""Mr. Trump, you have no idea. It's one of the worst areas for that.
It comes pouring across the southern border."" I said, ""You know what? If I win, I'm going to say -- I'm going to fix that problem."" Well, I am going to fix that problem. I'm going to fix that problem. And what are the ways -- I appreciate that. You know, I always like to say if I win because honestly, life is a very strange thing, and things.
And I don't want to be arrogant because I don't want to be accused by them of being arrogant. So I'll say if. But it better be win or I'm going to be very angry at you, folks, from Virginia. From Virginia. But the folks in New Hampshire -- and you're having the same problems but they're having it for whatever reason, disproportionately badly.
Heroin is pouring across the border and it's going a lot of --. it's going all over the country. By the way, everybody's got the problem. You buy it for less than a candy bar and our youth is being poisoned and plenty of other people. But our youth is being poisoned by this stuff. Heroin. Heroin. Thank you.
And what we're going to do is -- first of all, the Border Patrol agents endorsed me 16,500, they've never done that before. And their job is easier now without Trump. Their job is easier without Trump because you know, right now, they just stand and people go by and these are great people. I got to know them very well.
The Border Patrol agents want to do their job. It's a much tougher job probably a much more dangerous job. Would you stop people and say, ""Sorry, folks. Boom. Go back.""? But that's more dangerous than saying, you know, we can't do anything. It's called, stand back, stand back and leave them alone. Let them walk right in. How stupid are we? How stupid are we? OK? So I spoke to them, when they endorsed me. And I said, ""So let me ask you.
A wall, how important?"" They said, ""Mr. Trump, it's very, very important. Very, very important."" And they know. They know. See, I just saved a million dollars. Somebody else would go out and hire a consultant, who knows nothing. They come in from Harvard. They'd spend about a year at the border, they'd learn nothing.
They then write this 2,000 page report that nobody will read. They'll charge you $1 million for the report and you have no idea what just happened. As opposed to saying, like I did with the Border Patrol, ""Is the wall good?"" They said, ""Very good."" They actually used an interesting expression. They said, ""It's a vital tool, to turn things around."" It was very interesting expression.
They didn't say, great, bad. They just said, ""It's a vital tool, Mr. Trump, to turn things around. Especially, the drug traffic because it's very tough."" And we can build that wall so easily. And by the way, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. You know, I've just -- just because. They're going to pay for the wall.
And I got great -- we got great marks on the -- on the speech the other night and everyone did. Everybody did so great. We had such that -- by the way, I have to say, the Republican National Convention was such a tremendous success. It was so great. I mean, we had a couple of people that I think probably destroyed their careers but who knows.
But -- but honestly, no, but honestly, that was such an incredible success. And look at what's going on in Philadelphia. That was such a beautiful deal. The city of Cleveland was great and the law enforcement was unbelievable. We had no riots. We had no nothing. It was unbelievable. I'll never forget it as long as I live.
It was unbelievable. And -- and I made a speech. And I have to tell you because I figured this wouldn't happen because I could -- if I made a speech. If I -- if I gave the Gettysburg address as given as good as anybody could possibly get. I figured, you know, you always get neg -- you always get knocked.
I got great reviews on this speech. I got great reviews. We got standing ovations. Some people said, ""Well, the speech was a little long."" That's because we had 26 or 27 minutes of like standing ovations. We had applause. And I had a great time doing it because I'm talking about something that I love. We're in a movement, folks.
This is a movement. This isn't just -- I love what we're doing together, right? I love -- I love what we're doing together. I love it. And what really -- what I have to say is this, so Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. She shouldn't have picked, this guy. Big mistake. Because he is the exact opposite what all of the Bernie people want.
Now, if he got 2% of the vote or 5% of the vote or 20% of the vote. She's -- but you know what? He almost beat her. If the system wasn't gamed, if the system wasn't gamed he would have her. He would have beaten her now. Now -- now think of this, so instead of picking somebody, and you don't have to go with Pocahontas, you don't have to go that far.
Who by the way, who hasn't done anything? She is the worst -- she is the worst senator in the U.S. Senate. You know, she's got a fresh mouth other than that she's got nothing going. She has got -- she has done nothing in the U.S. Senate. But you don't have to pick her. But you could have picked a liberal person.
And we understand it. Where we can live with it. And you know, she could have had party unity, instead they have thousands and thousands of people going crazy because she didn't pick somebody representative. She didn't pick somebody representative. What's going on? Let's -- let's get -- look, again, she's got bad judgment.
Whether it's Libya, whether it's Benghazi, whether it's a night with the calls, with the calls, everybody is calling. The only call she answers is her friend calls. She picks that one up. But she doesn't pick up the calls for help. She's got bad judgment. Bernie Sanders said, ""She's got bad judgment."" She's got bad judgment when it came to picking a vice presidential candidate for that side of the party.
I actually just asked Mike Pence. I said, ""Mike, you think she's going to be forced to change."" Because honestly -- now, I wouldn't pick him. I wouldn't pick him for different reasons. You know why I wouldn't pick him? So Mike Pence, in Indiana, has done an unbelievable job. A Triple-A bond rating, so many different things.
Job creation, top in virtually every category. Right toward the top, at the top. Listen to this, during Tim Kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia, plus he's not very popular. I thought, that I would see polls saying, he's at 85% and Trump is going to lose Virginia. I'm going to hit -- people don't even like the guy.
And he lay in a little weed, weird little dude there. I don't know what's going on with him. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010. The unemployment rate of this state, more than doubled? So I immediately went back to my statistician. I said, ""Listen, do me a favor. Will you please check it?"" He came back, he said, ""Hey, maybe he's wrong."" But more than doubled.
This is your great governor, right? Now, Governor Mike Pence cut unemployment rate from 8.4% to less than 5%, quickly. Since 2013, Indiana has gone from 31st in the nation for veterans unemployment to 2nd and it's going to go to 1st. OK? Veterans unemployment. During Tim Kaine, that's the guy, that bad judgment Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Bad judgment. Such bad -- we can't have another president with bad judgment. We can't do it. During Tim Kaine's tenure as governor, the state of Virginia lost 60,000 manufacturing jobs. Now, Indiana gained 30,000. Now it's a different time and different everything. He was, you know, so I'm not comparing.
."" But I'll tell you, if Mike Pence or me, was running Virginia, we'd do great. This guy did a lousy job. You know why? He's a political hack. That's why. He's a political hack. Look what he's done -- look what he's done.
He's always been in politics. He likes politics. He wants to be in politics, always. OK. During Tim Kaine tenure as governor of Virginia, it averaged almost no GDP growth. And Indiana as you know is doing great. I mean, think of it, here's a beauty. OK. Nobody is going to vote for Tim Kaine when you hear this one.
OK? Tim Kaine. I never -- I never even heard of this guy but that's OK. Less than a week after Tim Kaine became governor of Virginia, one week, he proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase. Four billion. He tried to pass a transportation reform, he failed.
Whereas Mike Pence had tremendous luck. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. So a $4 billion tax increases first week. Do we want this as a president? No, you know. Look, hopefully we don't have to worry about it. I will say this, Virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton, these are my statisticians, they're great, signed the agreement to put China into the World Trade Organization.
Don't forget he did that. But Bill Clinton signed something that was the worst trade bill ever in the history of this country. OK? In the history of this country, NAFTA. That was built and people don't realize. I'll tell you a little joke, see how hot it is everyone? Everyone's sweating and soaking wet, right?
Here's the difference, I wouldn't pay the hotel bill. I'd say, ""We are in a hotel. We're in a ballroom."" And you know what? These are grown companies. We're in a ballroom and if we're in a ballroom, it's not supposed to be so hot that everybody in the audience is using as a fan. So what they do is they turn the air conditioning down because they save money.
So then, I would not pay them. And you know what I do? I pay my bills so fast with somebody good. With somebody average, I pay them OK. With somebody great, a lot of times I give them bonuses. But here we are, in a ballroom, and I'm like, I feel like I'm -- I'm in a sauna. OK? Right? Right?
So I don't know what hotel this is, but you want to try turning on the air conditioning. We're not going to get you pay. These people. Isn't it? Am I right? It's hot. Just so you know, I'm really good at this business. You make a lot more money if you own a hotel and you let people suffer and don't turn on air conditioning.
You make a lot more money. You would be surprised at how much it cost but this is ridiculous. And so then there'll be an article, ""Donald Trump refuses to pay the bills."" Of course. And you know what? The smart people say, ""Trump is smart."" The other people would say, ""Oh, isn't that terrible?"" OK? I think, the ballroom and the people that own this hotel should be ashamed of themselves.
Right. So look, so Virginia, lost one in three manufacturing jobs since the Bill Clinton bill. Hillary supported China's entry into WTO. Roanoke which is a beautiful place by the way, has lost one -- and I've been here many times, has lost one in three manufacturing jobs. OK? Since the Clinton disasters.
Last year, the U.S. trade deficit with TPP countries -- I mean, I could go into this. I could read this stuff to you. It gets a little boring after all but it's all the same thing. We have Hillary Clinton wanted to approve TPP that's Trans-Pacific Partnership. And then I announce that I'm against it. And then she heard me making a speech.
This is what I've heard, a friend of mine tell me. And I basically said the various reasons including monetary manipulation, currency manipulation, et cetera. Why it's no good? Why it will be another NAFTA? But maybe even worse. Can't be worse but it'll be as bad. OK? Different countries, but it'll be as bad.
As she heard me and she said, ""Oh, he'll kill me in the debate."" So what happened, is she all of a sudden came out against TPP. But as sure as you're sitting there, she's going to approve TPP. If she won, she will approve it. She'll make a change. She'll make a comma, she'll say, ""Move that comma."" Oh, now I can do it. OK? Folks, 6,000 pages of material that most people haven't read.
It is a disaster. Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster. You can't let it happen. We will never let it happen. I will never ever let it happen. And I don't want to make deals with many countries. I want to do one on one deals, one on one. You've got to see this deal. It's like a fancy jigsaw puzzle. Lines going here, here there.
So if one of the country misbehaves, you can't do anything because you're so locked up and it is very complex agreement. And believe me, it's just like Obamacare. Thousands of pages and nobody in Congress read it. And now, it's a disaster and we will repeal it and replace it with something fabulous. OK? All right?
But -- but we're going to have something that's going to be very special. And I have to tell you, I appreciate your being here. And I -- I really wish -- I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I appreciate the folks in the room next door which is almost as big as this and it's packed also.
And even more than you folks, I appreciate the people standing outside at 104, they're dying. They're dying. Although, I'd venture to say that they're more comfortable than I am right now. It's probably -- I think, it's actually cooler outside than it is in this damn ballroom. Ridiculous. Ridiculous.
But you know what? I -- I'll tell you, you know what I love? Look at this room, it's packed. You know what I love? And the other room's packed. What I love? Nobody left, not one person. I was watching doors. If I see doors starting to open, people pouring out, I usually stop but that never happens with me, never ever.
But -- but I stopped, nobody lives. Because you know what? We're in this together. We're in this together. This is a movement. So time magazine just did another cover. I talk about it. You saw the one from the back of my head. Right? It's pretty full back there. You know, it could be. It could be better.
It could be better but not bad. But a picture from the back of my head, the guy was standing right over me with a camera like this. I studied that picture very close. I didn't read the story but I did study the picture of it. No, I think that's No. 5 or six that we've had. So I think, I've had two in my lifetime and five or six in the last few months where, you know, we had this incredible thing going on. And they call it a movement and Bill O'Reilly calls it a movement.
He's never seen anything like. He said in his professional career, in his whole lifetime, he actually said, this is the single greatest political phenomena that he's ever witnessed. And Brit Hume said and a lot of people have said. And I really mean this, it's not about me, it's about you. There's -- there -- I'm a messenger.
There's a group of people in this country that's massive. You know, they used to call it a silent majority. I don't use the term. It's a noisy majority because we've had it. We've had it with the Iran deal. We've had it with our depleted military. We've had it with no borders. We've had it with education where we're ranked right near the bottom.
We're doing horribly. We've had it where they want to essentially abolish your Second Amendment. You have no protection for yourself. All right? We've had it. And the evangelicals, how many evangelicals do we have in here?
You better get out and vote because you didn't vote for Romney and you better get out and vote for me. You know, we have the Johnson Amendment where Lyndon Johnson, who is very powerful, put an amendment where basically our pastors, our ministers and all religions, they don't have the right to speak up. I had -- I had a meeting, I was telling Franklin Graham was a great guy, I was telling Jerry Falwell junior, who's a great guy.
Great guy. I mean so many, we had a meeting where we had 50 to 60 pastors, ministers and they were saying, ""We love you."" and they were praying. And it was like this incredible scene. And I said, ""OK. Well folks, can you endorse me? What we can't do that? Why?"" Because we'll lose our tax exempt status. I said ""Why?"" Now, nobody brought this up to me. They were living with it. Nobody was going to go fight it. I said, ""Why do you lose your tax exempt status."" Well, we're not allowed to speak.
And I said, ""Wait."" And I looked into it. I said, ""Whoa."" And that was passed by the ultimate politician, Lyndon Johnson. I mean, it's not like we're dealing with the pope. This was Lyndon Johnson. Smart, tough guy. But we're smarter and tougher. But look that was passed by a politician because he had problems with some of the churches in Texas where they were going after him for good reason.
And I said, ""Wait a minute folks."" And we put in our platform that we're going to work like hell to get rid of the Johnson Amendment because -- because your representatives, ministers, pastors, rabbis, they have totally lost their voice. And don't kid yourself. That's what's happening to religion in this country because you see the same numbers that I see.
So I think this, if you're evangelical, if you're Christian, if you're Jewish, if you have religion, you better go out and vote for Trump because this is gonna be the last chance you ever get to get this thing done. OK. Better. Thank you.
And I said in my I -- I will say this I will say this -- I will say this, I said in my speech the other night and I -- and I meant it. I thank the evangelicals because I won. I got these tremendous votes. They say, ""Trump can't win South Carolina."" Right? I said, ""Why?"" Because I'd have these tremendous crowds.
I won with evangelicals, I won all over with evangelicals because they get it. They're smart, they understand. They know I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect but they know I love them and they know I'm going to fight for them. Better than somebody that is perfect. OK? I'm going to fight for it. And I'm going to fight for other religions.
I'm going to fight -- I'm going to fight for people to be able to speak. And actually, when they said this to me, I was in an office building very high up and I'm looking down. And I said to these powerful pastors and these powerful men and women, it's just powerful people with tremendous strength and energy and conviction.
And they are so -- there in the room and it was beautiful, the voices. And I said, ""But that means that you are less powerful than those people walking down the street."" I pointed to the street. Because they have a right to talk and you don't. You don't have your right to talk. OK? And that's our religion -- that's our religion.
In my case, I'm Presbyterian, I'm Protestant. But -- but that's our religion. And -- my minister, who I like a lot, doesn't have the right to speak. We're going to end that folks. You got one chance, we're going to end it. So you better go back to your churches and you better get everybody to vote. Because four years ago, they didn't get up and they didn't vote for Romney.
And to this day, a lot of people don't understand and some people do understand it frankly. But you better get up and you better vote because if you vote -- if you think about it, the -- if you take Christian, Jewish take some of the Catholic, take the religions. It's bigger than men and it's bigger than women right?
It's bigger than men. You know, men are 50%, women are 50%. The religion is like what? 80% right? If you get up and vote. We're going to get rid of that and we're going to free up great people to go and speak what they want to speak about and they should be able to speak. OK? It's very important. So just a couple of things, and I -- I'd like to bring Mike up, a just a couple of things we are going to strengthen our military.
Our military is really depleted. Its not good. I didn't want to go into Iraq. We got there. I said, ""Keep the oil."" They didn't keep the oil. These people don't know what they're doing. You know in the old days, you're in a war to the victor belong the spoils. Right? Today, we get nothing. Trillions of dollars and cause, thousands and thousands of lives lost, we got nothing.
Iraq is a disaster. The Middle East is worse now than it was 15 years ago by a factor of 20. We would have done nothing. We would have been much better off. We got to build up our military. We never needed it so much. We never needed our military so much. So we're going to take care of our country. We're going to take care of our vets.
We're going to take care of our people. We're going to make America great again. And I -- and I have to tell you, one of the really good decisions, because I laugh when they say, ""Do you think Mr. Trump likes Governor Mike Pence?"" I love this guy, he's great. He's great. And everybody does. I'm getting such great marks and such great reviews.
Unlike Hillary, did I ask you before? Do you think she'll change? He looked to be said, ""No way because it's hard to do."" right? She may be forced -- she may be forced to change. He actually -- I'll tell you, Tim Kaine stands for the exact opposite of all of the Bernie Sanders people. I mean, it's ridiculous what she did.
Again, bad judgment. So I'm going to have Mike say just a few of the final words and I'm going to sit down and watch him. He is some great person. He's got some wonderful family. And we are having such fun going all over the place. And so Mike can finish off. And I want to thank you folks. Thank you.
Some of the great musicians have said, ""Never do an encore when you get a break."" So we did for you -- look how strong this is everyone standing everywhere. Now we do encore. We'll get a couple of bad questions, we'll walk out they'll say, ""They weren't so great."" Right. But we'll do it anyway right.
Do it anyway. So Mike was just asking if we'd want to take some questions.
Yes ma'am. Go ahead. Go ahead.
We're going to work. One thing we have to do for the youth and it's a question I get asked Mike more than any other question. We have young, fantastic people going to college and they're choking on their debt. OK. They're choking on debt. They haven't started life yet. And some of them have given up before they started because they see no way we're going to work on a plan and we're working on it now.
So that we can help young people get through college and not diverge. I mean some of these kids, what they're doing is incredible. They're the massive depression that's going on because they see no way of ever being able to pay it back. Now part of that's going to be jobs. But we're working on a plan now to take care of youth with respect to college debt.
We're going to work in a very good plan. We have to. We have to.
Do you own the hotel?
100%. We have to stand by Israel. 100%. Yes? Yes. Hello.
These are usually the toughest questions.
He knows -- he knows. Jacob, that wall will go up so fast and be so big and powerful and as good looking as we can make it that your head will spin. OK. Believe me, it's going to go up fast.
Go ahead. How about over here. Go ahead. Sure.
Cut your taxes and no more crazy regulations. OK?
Big. Right?
All right? The regulations are out of control. You know Mike so I've been all over the country and I would have always said taxes would be like the biggest thing. If I had my guess, I would say that people are more angry about regulations than the fact that we pay among the highest taxes in the world.
So we cut the regulations. OK?
OK. How about one more -- one more question?
One More.
Who -- who's got a good one? Who's got a good one? Go ahead. Give him -- I -- I like that question actually, right? Go ahead. Give him a mic. Give him a mic because that's such a great question. Go ahead.
Wow.
Wow. Are you a minister or a pastor? Wow, he is.
Now, I feel better, he is.
Very. So ladies and gentlemen, I just want to thank you. That's a great way to end actually, but I just want to thank you for being here. So important is on November 8, you have to get out and vote. If for no other reason, remember this, remember this, strong defense, strong borders. But remember Supreme Court justices, we're going to be appointing and Mike will be, absolutely we'll be right there with me. We'll be picking the best right off that list.
But we're going to be pointing anywhere from two to five, it could even be. And if you put the wrong people on, your back to Venezuela. This is Venezuela. So let me just tell you, if you can, get your friends, get everything you have to do on November 8, please get out to vote. It's going to be tough, going to be tough.
Because it's a stacked deck. It's a rigged system against all of us. The reason I won is because we had such an outpouring of love. I mean, the numbers were so big they couldn't do anything about it. But let me tell you, you got to get out on November 8th and you got to vote. You got to get your friends and your family and everybody involved.
OK? Thank you all very much. We love you. We'll be back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Roanoke, VA",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-roanoke-va-july-25-2016
James Madison,United States of America,1813-03-04 00:00:00,"About to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me, I find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence and of the responsibility united with it. The impressions on me are strengthened by such an evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge my arduous duties have been favorably estimated, and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed. From the weight and magnitude now belonging to it I should be compelled to shrink if I had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people, and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation, which forms so prominent a feature in our situation, is stamped with that justice which invites the smiles of Heaven on the means of conducting it to a successful termination. May we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on the characters by which this war is distinguished? It was not declared on the part of the United States until it had been long made on them, in reality though not in name; until arguments and postulations had been exhausted; until a positive declaration had been received that the wrongs provoking it would not be discontinued; nor until this last appeal could no longer be delayed without breaking down the spirit of the nation, destroying all confidence in itself and in its political institutions, and either perpetuating a state of disgraceful suffering or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more severe struggles our lost rank and respect among independent powers. On the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high seas and the security of an important class of citizens whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other class. Not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection. I need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the will of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign ones, nor paint the outrages inseparable from it. The proofs are in the records of each successive Administration of our Government, and the cruel sufferings of that portion of the American people have found their way to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature. As the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects, we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor, no usage of civilized nations, no precept of courtesy or humanity, have been infringed. The war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations, and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed. How little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy! They have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the United States not liable to be so considered under the usages of war. They have refused to consider as prisoners of war, and threatened to punish as traitors and deserters, persons emigrating without restraint to the United States, incorporated by naturalization into our political family, and fighting under the authority of their adopted country in open and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety. Such is the avowed purpose of a Government which is in the practice of naturalizing by thousands citizens of other countries, and not only of permitting but compelling them to fight its battles against their native country. They have not, it is true, taken into their own hands the hatchet and the knife, devoted to indiscriminate massacre, but they have let loose the savages armed with these cruel instruments; have allured them into their service, and carried them to battle by their sides, eager to glut their savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the work of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives. And, what was never before seen, British commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their chief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates. And now we find them, in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare, supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society, to dismember our confederated Republic. Happily, like others, these will recoil on the authors; but they mark the degenerate counsels from which they emanate, and if they did not belong to a sense of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as proceeding from a Government which founded the very war in which it has been so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary. To render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous, the reluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest manifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress. The sword was scarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the reasonable terms on which it would be resheathed. Still more precise advances were repeated, and have been received in a spirit forbidding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation. These resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable issue. Our nation is in number more than half that of the British Isles. It is composed of a brave, a free, a virtuous, and an intelligent people. Our country abounds in the necessaries, the arts, and the comforts of life. A general prosperity is visible in the public countenance. The means employed by the British cabinet to undermine it have recoiled on themselves; have given to our national faculties a more rapid development, and, draining or diverting the precious metals from British circulation and British vaults, have poured them into those of the United States. It is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable war should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions required to support it. When the public voice called for war, all knew, and still know, that without them it could not be carried on through the period which it might last, and the patriotism, the good sense, and the manly spirit of our fellow-citizens are pledges for the cheerfulness with which they will bear each his share of the common burden. To render the war short and its success sure, animated and systematic exertions alone are necessary, and the success of our arms now may long preserve our country from the necessity of another resort to them. Already have the gallant exploits of our naval heroes proved to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element. If the reputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other, presaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure us that nothing is wanting to correspondent triumphs there also but the discipline and habits which are in daily progress.

I was thrilled. I could not have been more happy. It was great seeing that he gave it was great and I got a lot of credit.
The medias, give me a lot of credit. People have given me a lot of credit. Nobody else has been able to get him to release his birth certificate.
I did -- it really made me feel good. Now I can get on to what's happening with oil, what's happening with the economy, how OPEC is ripping us off, how China's taking our jobs, the kind of things I want to be speaking.

George Osborne,United Kingdom,2015-11-28,"Thank you Mr Speaker for that kind introduction and for inviting me to give this evening’s lecture.
Many of your previous speakers have talked about their experiences in Government and the changes they have seen over their long careers.
I certainly hope that it’s a little too early in my career for a retrospective, and since this series features those who have occupied great Offices of State, I’d like to talk about the long history of the Office I occupy and add a few of my own observations of its modern role.
Of all the Great Offices of State and all the Departments, few evoke such strong feelings as Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury.
The late Sir Alistair Morton, whose role as Chief Executive of the Channel Tunnel put him at loggerheads with the holder of his purse strings, accused the Treasury of doing “more damage to the British economy than the Luftwaffe…”
Even that former Treasury official, John Maynard Keynes said the department is “an essential bulwark against overwhelming wickedness”.
A central Treasury has been a part of our national life since at least the time of the Norman Conquest.
The Domesday book can be seen as our first national tax register.
A brisk tour through Treasury’s highs and lows takes in the full sweep of Britain’s social, economic and political history – few institutions could claim their interests and decisions are more deeply ingrained in our national life.
Of course, not only is the Treasury a part of our history; it continues to play a central role on our nation’s behalf.
Or should I say “roles”, because the Treasury performs a number of different functions.
Tonight, I’d like to say something about the origins of those functions and about how they are performed today.
Let me start in a rather unexpected place: in Llantrisant in South Wales.
There is the home of the Royal Mint – a small part of the Treasury family that is more ancient than the Treasury itself.
It was established in the second half of the ninth century, and has been minting coins on behalf of the Crown ever since.
Its job has always been to provide confidence in the nation’s money – a job these days more than shared with the rest of the Treasury and the Bank of England, who print our banknotes.
The Master of the Mint is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and has been since Victorian times.
Every year in the City, the Trial of the Pyx takes place.
It is our country’s most ancient judicial ceremony.
First held in 1248, it is the annual occasion when the Master of the Mint is held to account for the quality of the coinage.
So I can say, hopefully without eliciting headlines that I have been put on trial twice.
In former ages, it was an essential occasion.
Unscrupulous medieval governments would debase the money supply by diluting the quality of the precious metal.
In the last century, the Treasury found more sophisticated ways to achieve the same thing.
When coins were made of silver or gold, they were constantly subject to counterfeiting or clipping by unscrupulous citizens.
Successive Masters of the Mint tried to tackle the problem – the most successful Master at doing so was Sir Isaac Newton.
He rebased the entire medieval coinage, because it had become so debased.
And he would personally inspect the coins in the taverns of Westminster to police the quality of the coinage.
These days, the Treasury officials are known to undertake similar field work in the Westminster Arms and the Red Lion.
When I first came to office I made the foolish error of thinking that since I was Master of the Mint, I could have some say over coin design.
After all, I regularly write to Her Majesty to ask her permission for new coin designs.
But when it comes to those designs, I have discovered I have little influence.
The true power lies with the Royal Mint Advisory committee.
Indeed, when early on I tried to reject one coin design I didn’t much like, I was told in a roundabout way that I couldn’t – and then discovered that Alistair Darling has also tried and failed to reject exactly the same coin design.
One of my first decisions as Chancellor that did stick was to reject plans to privatise the Mint.
When something has been part of your State for eleven centuries, you should think twice before getting rid of it.
And indeed, these days the Royal Mint leads the world in modern designs and technology – replacing our 5p and 10p coins with nickel-plated steel versions, producing new commemorative coins with colour in them – including a red poppy for Remembrance Day, minting this summer’s Olympic and Paralympic medals and making coins for over 60 countries.
I am happy to say that because of its overseas sales, it makes a handsome profit for the British taxpayer, and that money flows into the Exchequer.
Which is appropriate as after the Mint, the oldest part of the Treasury is the exchequer, which collected and issued money on behalf of the Crown.
The name “exchequer” comes from the chequered table – a sort of medieval excel spreadsheet – used from the beginning of the 1100s for calculating expenditure and receipts.
The Exchequer was overseen by a Lord High Treasurer and a Lord Chancellor.
The Lord High Treasurer was responsible for superintending all spending, while the Lord Chancellor acted as a check upon the accounts of the Treasurer.
By the 13th Century, the Treasurer and the Lord Chancellor had delegated most of their duties to an Under Treasurer and the Chancellor’s clerk – so in the reign of Henry III, the Clerk became an officer of the Court as the “Chancellor of the Exchequer”.
Exchequers were held twice a year when the Chief Justice, the Lord Chancellor, and the Treasurer sat round the chequered table, auditing the accounts of each local Sheriff who collected and spent money on behalf of the Crown.
A historical remnant of that event is that today, the Chancellor still has a role in the appointment of Sheriffs.
The money received by the Treasury in medieval taxes was recorded using tallies – eight inch long sticks, with notches to indicate the amount of money involved.
The stick would be cut in two, and one half given to the Sheriff as a receipt for the money.
These tallies were stored in vast quantities until 1834 when they caught fire and destroyed the Palace of Westminster – an early example of the sometimes incendiary relationship between the Treasury and Parliament.
Until the 17th century, a succession of Lord Treasurers had used their role in the Exchequer to consolidate their family’s personal power and wealth.
This reached its zenith when Sir Robert Cecil used his position as Queen Elizabeth I’s Treasurer to control not only the public purse but even to pay a network of spies to smooth the succession of his favoured candidate, King James I.
That’s why exactly 400 years ago this year, on Robert Cecil’s death in 1612, King James replaced the Lord Treasurer with the Treasury Board, to ensure that no one person could hold that level of power and influence over the Monarch.
That Treasury Board still exists today – and it is from the seat on this Board that the modern role of the Chancellor of the Exchequer began.
The most senior Board Member is, of course, the First Lord of the Treasury and by the 18th century was seen as the natural head of the Government – or the “Prime Minister”.
The door of 10 Downing Street still to this day bears the plaque “First Lord of the Treasury”.
And from 1827, the Second Lord of the Treasury was always the job of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
At around this time, it also became tradition for the Chancellor to live at No.11 Downing Street, a tradition only overturned by Tony Blair when he realised the living quarters in No.11 were bigger and kicked the Chancellor next door.
As well as the First and Second Lords of the Treasury Board, there were three other Lord Commissioners, who have evolved into the modern Government Whips.
They still play a key role today, signing around 200 documents a year on behalf of Treasury, at any time of day or night.
To celebrate its 400th anniversary, we convened a very brief meeting of the Treasury Board this summer, for the first time in twenty nine years, and only the second time in a hundred years.
The First and Second Lords attended, along with the remaining Lords Commissioners, the Financial Secretary and the Permanent Secretary.
We held the meeting in the Treasury Boardroom, a magnificent eighteenth century room in the Cabinet Office.
A throne is still there in case Her Majesty wishes to attend a meeting, although a monarch has not done so for over 200 years.
And by what romantic name is this historic Treasury boardroom at the heart of Government now called?
Conference Room A.
Not that the Treasury can complain.
Winston Churchill’s war time bedroom on the ground floor of the Treasury building is named “Ground floor 18”.
When we held our Treasury Board meeting earlier this year, the agenda reflected both the enduring and new functions of the Treasury.
First, the enduring: the Board approved a Warrant under the Duchy of Cornwall Management Act, permitting the Duchy to borrow £900,000 for an extension to a Chocolate Factory at Poundbury.
Oversight of royal expenditure is still a modern function of the Treasury and the Chancellor is a Trustee of the Royal Household.
The second item on our agenda reflected the new functions of the Treasury: the Board signed a number of Asset-Freezing regulations against individuals hostile to the interests of the UK– a reminder of the vital but little known role the modern Treasury plays in helping to keep our country safe and upholding international law – implementing financial sanctions against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and regimes such as Iran and North Korea.
That evening, we celebrated with a dinner at the Guildhall– attended by over 150 present and former Treasury Board members and Treasury Ministers – including those who had served in the Wilson and Heath administrations, and one who earned his invitation four times over – as a Lord Commissioner, as Chief Secretary, and as Second Lord and First Lord of the Treasury – Sir John Major.
But before you raise an eyebrow at such a lavish affair in these austere times – please be assured that when the Treasury throws a party, we get someone else to pay for it – on this occasion; the Corporation of London generously paid the Bill.
So what does the Exchequer part of the Treasury look like today?
Since Pitt the Younger’s day, there really is a single government bank account – it’s called the “Consolidated Fund”.
It was – and remains – a fundamental part of expenditure control
As William Pitt put it: “one fund into which shall flow every stream of public revenue, and from which shall come the supply for every service”.
Tax revenues, fines, penalties and other receipts come in.
And most payments to government departments flow out.
Last year, £514 billion pounds flowed through the Fund.
These days, it’s the job of the 19 civil servants in the Exchequer Funds team in the Treasury to make sure things run smoothly.
If you were looking for the irreducible core of the Treasury, this would be it: the cash register of the Government.
Every banking day, they essentially “write the cheques” so that millions of welfare payments, pensions and interest on government debt are paid out, and our schools and hospitals and other public services have money in the bank when they need it to pay salaries or buy supplies.
There is careful contingency planning to ensure this can always happen, whatever the circumstances.
To make the best use of taxpayers’ money, every day Treasury officials estimate how much cash the Government has, how much it needs and how much it has to borrow overnight from the markets.
It’s known as the Swing.
Most days, it’s easier to forecast what’s going to happen.
Some days it is more difficult.
This summer, the Treasury civil servant operating the Swing on Black Wednesday retired.
In fact, he wasn’t supposed to be on the Swing at all – the normal operator was off having had a heart bypass operation.
It is probably the largest number of transactions ever in a single day of Government operations, and things that had never been an issue before – like the fact that the Bank of England’s system could only cope with transactions of less than £100 million – suddenly caused problems.
Of course, if you pay out then you have to collect in – and tax collection has been a function of government since the birth of the English State.
Even before 1066, the Anglo-Saxon Treasury collected taxes – such as the “danegeld”, which was first levied as a tribute to the Vikings to persuade them – sometimes unsuccessfully – to stay away.
These days there is a whole international division of the Treasury tasked with dealing with our troublesome neighbours.
The foundations of Parliament itself in 1254 owes itself to King Henry III’s need to seek consent from the nobles of England for taxes he wished to impose.
The nobles advised the king to summon knights from each shire to help and advise and consent to the new tax.
In the 1260s, men from the towns were included with the knights, forming the beginnings of the House of Commons.
In those days, tax collection was done by a few local sheriffs – who were usually local judges or crown officials – who had to submit their accounts to the Exchequer.
These days, under Permanent Secretary Lin Homer’s leadership, 66,000 people at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs collect around half a trillion pounds from 33 million people.
Just under 10 years ago, the historic departments of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise were merged into this single non-ministerial department operating at arm’s length from government and focussed on collecting taxes and administering benefits, but very much part of the Treasury family.
At the same time, responsibility for strategic tax policymaking was transferred to the Treasury itself.
That brought the risk that those who knew how to actually collect taxes were no longer involved in designing the taxes.
I have sought to improve the relationship between the Revenue and the Treasury.
This year, we appointed as second permanent secretary at HMRC the most senior official on tax at the Treasury, and asked him to remain on the Treasury’s Board.
I would like to develop the relationship still further over the next few years, with the Treasury leading on the strategy, but informed by HMRC’s deep knowledge of the operational challenges.
This brings me onto the Treasury’s role in devising tax policy.
Every time you walk past a beautiful Georgian house and see a wall where a window used to be, you’re witnessing a visible sign of the Treasury’s well thought through tax policies in action.
When the Window tax was introduced in 1696, it was designed to make sure the wealthy paid more in tax.
These fine motives were soon undermined by as a new form of avoidance emerged.
Simply brick up the window.
Luckily we don’t have to deal with these sorts of issues today.
The window tax was hugely unpopular because it was seen as a tax on light and air – and nothing can be more essential than that.
Except as I discovered this year, the British people’s attachment to hot takeaway snacks.
In 1799, when William Pitt the Younger needed to fund the Napoleonic wars, he introduced a simple temporary tax to pay for it – called the “income tax”.
212 years later it is still temporary – and requires the annual Finance Bill to renew it.
The Napoleonic Wars meant the share of the nation’s wealth taken in tax almost doubled, from 12 per cent to 23 per cent of national income – and at the same time, the national debt ballooned from five per cent of national income in 1688 to twice the national income in 1815.
War has always been a consistent driver of the Treasury’s rising power, since the Treasury’s success at financing wars was inextricably linked with British victories.
William Pitt created the income tax and the consolidated fund, but it was William Gladstone who created the modern job of the Chancellor.
That is the reason his painting hangs in the Chancellor’s study in No.11 Downing Street.
It was Gladstone’s force of character, and his compelling vision of free trade, simple taxation and sound public finances which established not only his own place as one of the towering political figures of the 19th century – but also the annual Budget’s place in the UK’s political economy.
It was Gladstone who initiated the Northcote-Trevelyan report which ushered in recruitment of civil servants by open competition and promotion on merit in the Treasury and other departments of government.
It was Gladstone who created the Public Accounts Committee, increasing Parliament’s role in scrutinising waste and corruption in the use of public money.
And of course, almost every Chancellor is reminded of Gladstone’s instrumental role in the Treasury when they hold up his red box on Budget day.
When I took office, I was told the red box was too fragile to use.
But I insisted on using it one last time for my first Budget, before consigning the original to a display cabinet in the House of Commons and reluctantly commissioning a replica.
To an outsider, the theatre of Budget day can seem like just another strange English tradition.
But I believe it is more than that.
It is an annual reminder of what Gladstone instilled in us like no other – that sound public finances are the bedrock of stability on which our country is built, and that what government spends has to be paid for.
These days around 750 Treasury civil servants – almost three quarters of the department – are involved in ensuring all the various policies come together on the day.
Although for all the innovations and endless tax rates announced in modern Budgets – it’s worth remembering this fact: of the £470 odd billion pounds of revenue collected last year, £350 billion came from just three taxes: income tax, national insurance and VAT – taxes that have been in place since 1799, 1911, and 1973.
Of course, tax isn’t the only way of raising money – at least in the short term.
The other method is debt – and managing the public debt is another vital function of the Treasury.
Medieval kings had always borrowed money to fight wars.
But the first UK government debt dates from 1694, money borrowed to rebuild the navy after a crushing defeat by the French at the Battle of Beachy Head.
A 1.2 million pound loan, at 8% interest with no fixed repayment dates was arranged with a collection of financiers.
This, incidentally, was the origin of the Bank of England – since the subscribers were incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England – in exchange for giving the bank exclusive possession of the government’s balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank-notes.
The costs of borrowing grew as the Government’s fiscal credibility deteriorated, and in 1711, the Chancellor at the time, Robert Harley, unveiled an ingenious scheme to reduce the cost of the national debt.
He offered people the option to buy stock in the South Sea Company.
The expectation of vast wealth from trade with the South Sea was used to encourage the public to buy shares at hugely inflated prices, while the founders of the scheme engaged in insider trading to amass a vast personal fortune.
Thankfully, nothing like that happens these days…..
When the South Sea Bubble finally burst in 1720, thousands of investors lost their money, and the whole country suffered.
It’s a reminder that dealing with the consequences of financial speculation and banking failure can do enormous damage to the real economy.
The Chancellor of the time was sent to the Tower – a reminder to modern Treasury officials that there was a fate worse than the P.A.C.
These days, as we pick up the pieces of perhaps the greatest banking collapse in our history, the Treasury has over a hundred officials devoted to financial services policy.
Since becoming Chancellor, I’ve had to make the difficult decision to allow one bank to fail.
The 250 depositors received protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the insured limit of £85,000, but not beyond this level.
And do you know the name of the bank I allowed to fail?
The South Sea Mortgages and Investment Company.
Thankfully, no government debt was invested with this particular South Sea Company.
Since 1998, a part of the Treasury called the Debt Management Office is responsible for raising money on the Government’s behalf.
You could argue that the 100 strong team at the DMO do the single most important job in the British civil service.
Without their gilt auctions and overnight money operations, the Government would literally run out of money.
As the scale of the UK’s debts has risen, so too has the scale of the challenge for the DMO.
In the entire period between 1694 and 1998, the Bank of England sold some £355 billion of government debt.
Last year, just thirteen years into its existence, the Debt Management Office sold its trillionth pound of debt.
Of course, one of the present Government’s overriding objectives is to ensure those debt sales are reduced sharply as we bring the public finances back under control.
And because of the market’s confidence in the credibility of government policies, I have established a new record – 1.9% today.
I am currently borrowing money at a lower rate than anyone who has done my job in its 800 year history.
It’s more than a record.
It saves Britain billions of pounds a year – and it’s a reminder that when the Treasury loses the confidence of investors, debt interest can quickly squeeze out all other spending in government.
This brings me to spending control – a function of the Treasury that employs a huge amount of time and effort.
It was naval humiliation which laid the foundation of modern public expenditure control.
Naval spending dwarfed everything else in those days, but King Charles II was so poor that the English Navy was seriously underfunded, culminating in the humiliating seizure of the navy’s flagship by the Dutch in 1667.
So in that same year, with George Downing as Secretary, the Treasury Board obtained the powers over public spending it holds today.
The Treasury Board ordered that individual Treasurers – the forerunners of departments “do forebear making any payments without directions from the Commissioners of his Majesty’s Treasury”.
So the Chancellor of the Exchequer owes George Downing not only his or her home, but also their ability to control expenditure.
That principle – that all public money must have specific Treasury’s approval, even if it has already been voted for by Parliament – still largely holds – today.
In 1961, the job of Chief Secretary was created to give the Treasury a Cabinet Minister focussed exclusively on spending control.
That brings the total number of Treasury Ministers in the Cabinet to four – if you include the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip.
The military remained the biggest item of spending until the early twentieth century – when what you can describe as the modern welfare state was founded.
In 1900 the British state consumed around 15 per cent of national income.
Today, it consumes 46 per cent – a number I regard as far too high.
If one Chancellor could claim more responsibility for this trend than any other, it would of course be David Lloyd George – the third Chancellor whose portrait hangs in No.11 Downing Street, alongside Gladstone and his rival Disraeli.
Lloyd George’s famous People’s Budget of 1909 introduced social insurance for the first time, funded by taxes on cars, on petrol, and a new tax on land and property.
Though those tempted by a modern version of a property tax should note Lloyd George’s land tax was eventually abandoned when it cost more money to collect than it raised.
The 1909 Budget and the row that followed increased the power of the Treasury – it could not fail to do so as more of national income came under Government control while the power of the House of Lords to scrutinise bills was removed.
But it was about more than just money.
For the first time, Lloyd George expressed the intent to redistribute wealth among the British public – using tax and spending to deliver the Government’s social objectives in a way that we now take for granted.
He said of himself: “I am the only Chancellor who ever began by saying and meaning to spend money”.
Quantity of spending matters a lot to the Treasury.
So should quality.
In today’s Treasury, spending teams shadow each of the main Whitehall departments – so there is a Treasury health team, an education team, a defence team and so on, providing scrutiny and challenge to departments, and advice to the Chief Secretary and I on decisions requiring Treasury approval.
And as we’ve both discovered, we are constantly bombarded with requests for more money – with everyone arguing that their area should have a bigger slice of the pie – and everyone devising ingenious schemes that you’re told pay for themselves if only the Treasury would pay a little money upfront.
There is a never ending stream of vested interests, trade unions, pressure groups and politicians all defending every line item of government spending and asking for more.
But for every lobby group or trade union that appears on the Today programme, there are millions of normal hard working people who never appear on the radio, but have to pay for the demands of those who do.
So I am proud that the only vested interest that my Treasury defends is the taxpayer.
As Sir Thomas Heath, permanent secretary to the Treasury during World War One put it, someone must “stand between the country and national bankruptcy”.
You cannot talk these days about the modern Treasury and the public finances without a mention of the Office for Budget Responsibility.
I believe its creation can already be seen as a major milestone in the long evolution of the Treasury.
As Chancellor, I have renounced the power over the economic and public finance forecasts that all my predecessors held in one form or another over the centuries.
That power was ultimately illusory – Treasury forecasts and the temptation to fiddle them, doesn’t alter the economic reality the Chancellor has to confront.
Indeed, I would argue that because the OBR strengthens the credibility of the macro-economic framework – it in turn strengthens the credibility of the Treasury.
We may have lost the role of making forecasts – but the Treasury is very much in the business of improving the performance of the economy that stands behind them.
The final role I’d like to touch on is the Treasury’s role not just as a finance ministry, but as an economics ministry too.
The Second World War changed everything in this respect.
Coordination of the economy had been vital to Britain’s military success, and the devastation of Britain’s economy meant there could be no return to business as usual once the war ended – direct control of imports, control of consumption and savings all remained in force for years to come.
It was by no means a foregone conclusion that this economics ministry job would fall to HMT.
During the war, the Cabinet Office had held the reins on central economic planning.
It was only when Sir Stafford Cripps’, who had been Minister for Economic Affairs under Atlee, became Chancellor in 1947 and brought his portfolio with him that the Treasury gained this job.
Harold Wilson attempted to split the roles again in 1964, giving responsibility for economic planning and growth to a newly formed Department for Economic Affairs.
His rationale was primarily political – he had a George Brown problem– and was delighted with the opportunity to give his rival a post appropriate to his status, without actually giving him control of the nation’s finances.
But it also partly reflected Wilson’s view that a commitment to controlling public spending was somehow antithetical to the promotion of economic growth.
Five years later, the new Department of Economic Affairs was abolished and I remember as a new backbench MP many a happy conversation with the last junior Minister in the department and then Father of the House, Alan Williams, about how it lost its fight for survival against the mighty Treasury of Jim Callaghan and Roy Jenkins.
But the debate about whether to split economics and finances did not die with the Department of Economic Affairs.
But my experiences at the Treasury have made me even more convinced that Wilson was wrong to think that finance ministry objectives and economic growth are natural enemies.
The Treasury must be more than just a finance ministry – it must be the driver of economic reform across the government.
And that is my priority today.
I think the Chancellor before me who best understood that was Nigel Lawson.
He combined a finance ministry with a strong economics ministry, reforming taxation, reducing marginal tax rates and abolishing ineffective taxes not simply for reasons of revenue but to promote enterprise and economic performance.
Nigel made his Treasury the powerhouse of ideas in Margaret Thatcher’s government championing privatisation and economic deregulation.
Today, the Treasury is focussed on both the public finances and economic performance.
When I look back at the decisions I have taken, I ask myself.
Would a finance ministry faced with a huge budget deficit have reduced corporation tax to boost growth?
Would a finance ministry looking for Whitehall budgets to cut have protected science spending, even though it’s one of the easiest taps to turn off?
I believe it would have been more, not less difficult to make these tradeoffs if there was an institutional split – and it’s right that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is accountable for getting that balance right.
In the Treasury today, we seek to integrate all the functions: whether on European policy and tax, or the supply side and spending, or banking and growth.
And when my excellent Permanent Secretary, Sir Nick Macpherson and I have found barriers between different parts of the Treasury, we have broken them down.
We have reflected this in the organisation of the Treasury, abolishing baronial directorates of 200 or so staff and replacing them with more flexible groups of 70 or so officials, supported by a flexible team which can move resources to where they are most needed.
We have brought HMRC officials more closely into the policy making process – if tax policy is to be effective, it must be deliverable.
The Treasury of the future needs to be sufficiently flexible to deal with the great issues of the day – the recovery from a banking crash, the global race in competition, the problems with the euro, the renewal of our nation’s infrastructure, even Scotland’s role in that nation.
I want the Treasury to be the challenge to conventional wisdom in Whitehall and the source of new ideas.
And I want it to retain sufficient hard-headed expertise to fulfil its enduring role as the nation’s economics and finance ministry.
In the long history of the Treasury, there have seldom been more challenging times – as we recover from the greatest banking crisis, deal with the largest deficit in our peace time history and the continuing economic crisis across the globe.
I am proud to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and of what the Treasury has achieved over the last two and a half years and I’ve been fortunate enough to hold this Great Office of State.
But I’m just as proud to work alongside the brilliant Treasury officials who perform a vital role on behalf of our country – as they have done for a thousand years – and it is to them we all really owe a huge debt of gratitude.
",2012 Speech at Speaker’s House,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/george-osborne-2012-speech-at-speakers-house/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-03-02,"Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp. What a job he's done. And to CPAC -- I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here -- probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third.
Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President. Right? But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world.
They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital ""E"" -- it's never been done before. And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger.
And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had 17 Republicans, plus me. People just didn’t quite understand that. They didn’t understand it. I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well.
And it's driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for months and months, ""There is no way to 270""? You know what that means, right? ""There is no way to 270."" They couldn’t get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there wasn’t any way to 270. In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one.
But we didn’t need the one. We didn’t need it. We won Maine. We won our half of Maine, remember? You have Nebraska. We won both in Nebraska. We won the half we had to win in Maine. So we got the one, but we didn’t need the one, because we didn’t get 270; we got 306 to 223. 223-306. A state called Wisconsin, a state called -- Michigan, where -- by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible -- expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce.
Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we're going to do even better in 2020. I think we're going to do numbers that people haven’t seen for a long time. The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting America’s interests, defending America’s value, and reclaiming our nation’s priceless heritage.
It's true. With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It wasn’t ""America first."" In many cases, it was ""America last."" Those days are over.
Long over. America is winning again. America is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents -- and I get along with them -- because they know that what's taken place over many years -- not just the Obama administration; long before that -- they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They can't believe it. An impossible thing.
And they like me. And the reason they like me -- they tell me; they say, ""Mr. President..."" I said -- as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, ""How is it possible that you got away with this for so long."" It's true.
When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent -- and they said to me, ""We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that."" And I don’t blame them.
We should’ve been doing the same thing to them. But we didn’t. True. Right? Hard to believe. It's hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we're negotiating with China. They wouldn’t negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich.
The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they weren’t terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found 301 and 382. I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in -- it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didn’t know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough.
It was called the Great Tariff Debate. Mark Levin will look this up. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We didn’t know what to do with all of the money we were making.
We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, ""Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We can't do that. We can't ever allow that to happen."" And, you know -- I don't know, maybe you know.
You know I'm totally off-script, right.
Thank you, darling. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we don’t go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, ""No, no...
The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal -- I encourage it. I think it's really something that they should promote. It's something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to. I'm mandated.
But they should stay with that argument. Never change. No planes. No energy. ""Darling"" -- ""Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling.
So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, ""Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in."" I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use.
Should I use it? I won't do it. Our great First Lady always said, ""Don't use certain words, please."" I said, ""But the audience wanted me to do it."" She said, ""Don't do it."" And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through. They'll just use the word, and they'll said, ""Isn't that terrible."" So I won't use it.
-- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, ""Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please."" ""Please get us the emails. Please.
So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, ""He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible. ""He asked Russia for the emails."" These people are sick.
. They know the game, and they play it dirty -- dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it's ever been played. But the thing that we've done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs -- and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they don’t like tariffs.
I'm not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion.
Not like $200 million -- that's a lot. This is 200 with a ""B"" -- billion. Two-hundred billion. So -- but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it weren’t for tariffs -- and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position.
But in my case, it can't, because it's true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China -- $500 billion a year. And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year. China -- just one country. We lose with everybody, almost.
But China is one country. $507 billion, for many years. So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that haven’t done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country -- as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while.
Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. Okay? Twenty-one. That’s what the numbers are. It's very simple. You know, everyone said, ""Oh, it's a tax on our..."" It's not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible.
But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows. Where is the great Mark Meadows? He's here someplace. Man, has he been good. Mark and Jim Jordan, and -- I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people.
Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They've been fighting. And I just see Mark in the audience. They've been fighting -- with Deb, much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her.
But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying. So they don’t have anything with Russia. There's no collusion. So now they go and morph into, ""Let's inspect every deal he's ever done. We're going to go into his finances.
We're going to check his deals. We're going to check..."" These people are sick. I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday. No, it's the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, ""We're going to look into his finances."" I said, ""Where did that come from?"" He always talked about Russia -- collusion with Russia.
The collusion delusion. We're waiting for a report by people that weren’t elected. We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson.
This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I'm not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started. ""This is Ronald Reagan."" Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote.
Those red hats -- and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. ""Make America Great Again,"" is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there.
And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay. Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, ""I'm going to recuse myself."" And I said, why the hell didn’t he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself?
But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote. Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission. These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen.
. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why isn’t that mentioned?
He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why isn’t that -- and I didn’t give it to him. Why isn’t that mentioned.
-- is his best friend. James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it's wonderful. I thought of it this morning, Mark. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today. Mark Levin. I heard it was incredible.
And I was on the way. But I'll see it later. I guarantee I'll be watching it later. I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called TiVo.
But people that got no votes. But I heard this morning, ""President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."" I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight. No obstruction. That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction.
But only for Trump. For nobody else. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter -- horrible -- about Comey. Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible..."" -- First Lady -- I said, ""Melania, I'm doing something today.
I'm doing it because it really has to be done."" He's bad. He's a bad, bad -- he's a bad, bad guy. That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. ""I'm doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It's going to be bipartisan. It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan.
Every Republican hates him. He did a horrible job at the FBI. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the FBI are incredible people -- not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady -- I said, ""But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan.
Everyone is going to love it."" So we fire Comey. And Schumer -- who called for his resignation many times -- Podesta, I believe that day -- because he still hasn’t gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe that day called for his resignation. That day. Podesta, the great genius of campaigns.
. Others -- almost every, I would say. Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every -- I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job. So I said to Melania, ""Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing.
I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, ""How dare he fire him. How dare he do this."" And that's where we are, folks. That's where we are. We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C. But you know what? We're winning, and they're not. We're winning. So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this.
."" You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, ""Bye, folks."" But you know what I like about this? Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love. We're all in love together. We've done something that nobody has ever done. Right?
It's easy. No, it's easy. You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer. He's a brutal man. And he said, ""What are you going to speak about today?
Like, what are you going to speak?"" I said, ""I don't know. I don't know. They're all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They're in many hotel rooms all over the place. You're just better at real estate than they are.
But this guy -- you all know his name -- very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes. You know, juh-juh. ""Are you okay?"" He kills people for a living -- meaning mentally and financially -- but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like ""augh."" And I said, ""It's easy."" And the reason it's easy -- I really mean this -- there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk.
You can talk your heart out. You really could. There's love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower. It's been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat.
We went out and helped Ted Cruz. We went out and helped so many people. And I'll tell you what: If we didn’t do those 32 rallies -- and it wasn’t easy. When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people -- in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up. We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000. Tens of thousands were outside.
We were sending notices, ""Please don’t come."" That's a little different. Usually, people are begging. ""Well, yeah, like can somebody come.
No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note -- something to the effect, ""Not very good crowd size, Mr. President."" And I never saw it because I don’t follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldn’t get in -- he got there four or five hours early because he doesn’t fly private.
You know. You think maybe that's it. Must be the carbon footprint. He just doesn’t want private. But he got there hours early. And, you know, the place hadn’t started taking in people. They weren’t going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody.
And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I don’t think we've had an empty seat since we announced.
And from the day we came down the escalator, I really don’t believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It's been an incredible thing. And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory.
And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here -- Mercedes, thank you. They always say -- you know, they're good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, ""Don't bring it up. Don’t fight. Don’t fight.
Everyone understands."" I said, ""They don’t understand."" If I don’t explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena one, right? And then it was shown. And the Washington Post had to do -- and this particular writer -- had to do a -- I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot.
He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they hadn’t opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible.
And I watched it by mistake. They showed from the Cap- -- they showed -- there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The Capitol down to the Washington Monument -- people. But I saw pictures that there were no people.
Right? And they always mention crowd size. ""He talks about crowd size."" So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, ""Mercedes"" -- and Sarah -- ""show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken hours before."" And remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument.
And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder.
But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on -- I said to the people that were sitting next to me, ""I've never seen anything like this.
Look at that crowd."" And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it. And I have to live -- I have to live with ""crowd size."" It's all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day. That was a great day for us. That was a great, great day.
People came from all over. People came from all over. So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, ""Sir, it doesn’t matter. Nobody cares."" I said, ""But I care. People care. So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one. I'll give it to Mark Levin. And I'll give him the picture.
Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it. And you'll see the sun. You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right. You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that.
Sunday night, everybody. Sunday night. Huh? Ten o'clock, right? Sunday night at 10 o'clock. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for. Don’t fall asleep, right? Don’t fall asleep. You know, somebody said, ""Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible."" They said it was incredible.
They said that was so great. And I said -- I said -- I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there..
A lot of it is their bosses -- which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is. Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country.
And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.
And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it. Now we'll have to find out.
But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope. And we're going to see what happens. And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR. Perhaps the largest field in the world -- oil and gas.
I got it approved. And I didn’t want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Don’t get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I don’t want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business.
He's not asking for anything. He said -- but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, ""Hey"" -- and they all call me ""Mr. President."" I have friends that, for 35 years, ""Hey, Don, how you doing? Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny."" For 35 years. Now they call, ""Mr. President, sir."" I have a friend -- a very rich guy -- Richard LeFrak, in New York.
A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, ""Hey, Don, how you doing?"" I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten. ""Hi, Don, how you doing? How's everything?"" And now I get a call the other day, ""Mr. President, how are you, sir? How are you?"" I said, ""Richard, lighten up. Lighten up."" ""Richard, call me 'Donald'."" You've known me for -- I don’t want to say, because I don’t want my wife to hear the number.
Actually, that's true. That's actually true. Richard came up; he said, ""I've known your husband for 65 years."" I said, ""Don’t say that. Don’t say 65 years."" But I said, ""Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do. Call me 'Don'."" ""Okay."" ""Okay, Don. Okay."" He gets his breath.
Uh-huh. Two minutes later -- ""Mr. President... Maybe that's a good thing, right? Many -- many of my friends. And that wasn’t in the script either, Mark.
Many decades. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio -- they're closing. They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico. They're going to move to China. They're going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers.
And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. Those days are all gone, folks. They're all gone. They're all gone. And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location.
It's now a very costly -- they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it's costly. It's painful. It used to be almost -- I said -- I used to -- I've been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I'm for America first. That wasn’t for America first.
And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They're coming back in. They're coming back in. And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall. We're finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It's in the thing.
But -- and there will be some people in the room that don’t like this. We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment -- the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place.
This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit.
They've got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in Congress -- right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country.
And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It's sad. It's very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad. Very, very -- and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well?
Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, ""Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up."" But that's okay, I don’t mind. I'll bring it up. Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. One other thing -- because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes.
We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader. I'm a free trader. But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found -- tremendous -- old stuff.
Nobody even knew it existed. I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided. Last year, we lost eight hundred -- this for many years -- almost $800 billion on trade. It's not sustainable. You can't do that. And now we're making great trade deals.
But when some of the senators -- good people; I think they're good people. I just don't understand the thinking. So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent. When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing.
So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax. Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people -- Lindsey Graham. I said, Lindsey -- it's not his thing necessarily. It's not the thing that he's most adept at. But he's adept and he's smart.
I said, ""Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..."" If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, ""That makes sense to me. But he's a smart guy, and he said -- I'll never forget. It took me about a minute, which is a long time.
I did a bad description. It's so easy. They charge 100; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be -- and that's okay. What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff.
Okay? It's going to happen. That's going to happen. But you have to -- you have to start working on some of the senators that say ""I can't approve this deal."" I say, ""You know what? I want to just charge India"" -- as an example, I'm using it. But India is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody -- nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington.
. So they charge 100. So I say, ""I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent."" And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, ""Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product.
I want to charge them 25."" And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100. ""But I'm doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support."" ""Sir, that's not free trade."" Where do these people come from. Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help -- the voters' help.
Where do they come from? So it can only be one of two or three things. Number one, I know they're very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. So we take that out of the equation. So even -- and I know they don't have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe -- you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous.
Campaign contributions -- they're very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I don't think so. I hope not. Because we're talking about our country. We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product. For one thing, they don't respect us. They think we're ""stupido."" They don't respect us.
They respect us. And America is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed. So with all of those things -- and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable.
You understand that. With all of that, we're doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There's no inflation, essentially. There's no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market?
If we didn't do quantitative -- and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy.
5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent.
It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American -- and you've heard me say this many times -- Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows.
And African American income has reached an all-time high. ""How do you get to Europe?"" ""We haven't figured that one out yet. We don't use airplanes anymore.
They have a fast train. The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea -- the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. When I'm with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. He said, ""You're a great President.
You're doing a great job."" He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks. So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. Everybody else does. Check them. Check them. Called me up three or four weeks ago. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have.
I said, ""You got to get those forests."" We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It's called management. When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree.
It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently -- let's say four weeks ago or so. He said, ""I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met."" That's what he said.
Now, that's what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. ""And you're doing a great job. That's okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. Gavin Newsom.
I like him. Nice guy. But they say things -- you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference -- just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well -- except, of course, for the Never Trumpers.
But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mouth to mouth. They're hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges.
And 17 appellate division judges. That we've got the best economy maybe in our history. That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond. That we've taken care of our military with -- $1.7 billion.
Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers -- nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have -- because I'm a cost cutter. But -- and you are all cost cutters.
But we have to take care of our military. We have to. Seven hundred billions dollars we spent. And that was the first year. And then the second year, $716 billion. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end.
And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It's time.
Been in these wars. We were going to be in Syria for four months. We ended up five years. This fighting -- they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It's time. It's time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, ""General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?"" He said, ""Sir, two years."" I said, ""I can't take it two years."" And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House -- because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.
. I figured it would look good. So I stayed in the White House. And I'll tell you what: I was there -- I told my wife, ""Go to Florida.
Enjoy your Christmas."" I stayed for Thanksgiving. I said -- I mean, I was in the White House for a long time. Months. Months. I had cabin fever in the White House.
I spent my New Year's all by myself.
Don't cry. All -- it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, ""Man..."" They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, ""I'm in this mess"" -- you know, people don't know how big the White House.
First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's really -- I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is -- 1799 -- which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say ""1799,"" like it's old. To him, that's like a brand-new house in China.
So that's -- that's like a new -- that's like a new residence. But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off. I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, ""Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off."" I say, ""Why."" We're an hour out.
I said, ""What about the shades?"" ""Well, we want it better than that. So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One. And we're landing, and I go up and I look. And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world.
I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, ""Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."" I say, ""But there's no runway."" ""No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir."" I say, ""I don't see it."" I have pretty good vision.
. But I don’t have vision like a 35-year-old captain. He said, ""No, it's right up there."" I said, ""I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there's no runway."" Anyway -- he sits right up there and we land. There's practically not lights.
These are little pin spots. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people.
I met some incredible people -- generals. One of them came from Syria -- the operation in Syria. And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It's not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I didn't know.
General one, general two, general three. I mean, these generals -- there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, ""What's your name? ""Sir, my name is Raisin."" What the hell kind of a name."" He goes, ""Yes, sir, Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Caine.
Raisin Caine."" It's true. Raisin Caine. I just made him a big star."" So we changed his name. Called him ""Mad Dog."" But it wasn’t working too well.
Mad Dog wasn't working too well. So what happened is I flew to Iraq. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I didn't have to go there.
I didn't have to go there. Because I meet -- and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent $3 billion building it. It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast. I said, ""Well, how do we leave this thing?"" So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants.
And I said, ""Bring the cameras. I'm going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left."" ""It won't, sir."" And I said, ""Tell me why it won't."" ""It won't, sir.
If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster."" ""Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can"" -- ""Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week."" I said, ""One week? I was told two years. ""That's right, sir. We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over -- from the base that you're right on, right now, sir.
They won't know what the hell hit them."" ""They won't know what the hell hit them, sir."" And I said, ""Why didn't my other generals tell me that? Why didn't they tell me that?"" I said, ""Did you tell them that?"" ""Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders.
You're the first one to ask us our opinion."" It's true. It's true. True. True. So I went back and I said, ""I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin. I think you're great."" But I did say -- I said, ""Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq. Isn't that very far away from..."" ""I was here in a very short time, sir.
I flew right in."" Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site -- my father was a builder. He always used to say, ""Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk."" It's true. It's true. He'd say, ""You got to be on this site.
You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they're ripping you off. You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked.
And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down."" True. You don’t get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I didn't want to do that. And I'm in the White House and I was lonely. I said, ""Let's go to Iraq.
And I'll tell you, those generals -- not just Raisin Caine, General Caine. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting. These guys -- you couldn’t -- I mean, it's incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie.
That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in -- a sergeant, a drill sergeant -- to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't. That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people.
You know the movie I'm talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well -- and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before -- Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination.
Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare. Their radical government-run plan -- if you call it that -- would lead to colossal tax increases -- increases like you've never seen before -- and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans.
And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal.
. It's true. Who would believe it? It so -- it's so bad. But I don't -- I'll be honest with you, folks. I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, ""Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"" He said, ""Yeah, would you do that?"" By the way, everybody okay?
I haven't seen anybody leaving. I haven't seen anybody. I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left.
Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000. They showed two empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, ""Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing."" Then they came back.
They went to the bathroom. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world.
We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made. Happened over the last two years, by the way. And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We think we're almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent.
We need pipeline approval. We're going to have it very quickly. It would have taken -- it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process. We should have it done. We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads. Oh, that's not so bad. They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay?
So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, Meadows? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I don’t think so. It's not looking good. I think maybe -- maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes.
It would end air travel. But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it. You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States. New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again.
I don't think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years -- white hair. See, I don't have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic.
And these senators -- these senators: ""Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree."" The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii. Right? She's like -- she's like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she's standing in the hallway.
And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's -- you know, she can't understand that plan. Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, ""What do you think? Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan. I don't get it. I don't get it. So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to -- well, we can take boats, I guess.
We'll go back to boats. This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it. I don't. I don't. I swear I don't. This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that.
I'm going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it."" I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year.
That would be terrible. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. Socialism is not about the environment.
It's not about justice. It's not about virtue. Socialism is about only one thing. It's called ""power for the ruling class."" That's what it is. Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places. All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism.
And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject -- and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever.
Young Americans -- I love young Americans. Speaking of young Americans -- Candace, stand up. Candace is getting married. Stand up. You've been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You're getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. You've been so great.
Thank you very much, Candace. Thanks. And, Charlie, what a job you're doing. Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie? Where is Charlie Kirk? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, Charlie. But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance.
The anger -- the unbelievable anger -- I see it every day. Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas.
These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today. There's a young gentleman. I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face.
Violently punched. And I said that's disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, ""Donald Trump attacked."" No, no, no. Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum.
. I don’t want to do it again. So, the man's name is Hayden Williams. Where's Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden, come up here. Come up here.
Thank you.
Stay here for a second. So, here's the one thing. I was going to call him, but I don't have to now. I see him here. But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch.
He was a strong guy. But you know what? You've got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that.
He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden -- here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That's okay. Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech -- if they want federal research dollars.
If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they don't, it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all.
We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms -- which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It's under siege.
Be careful. But I'll protect you, I promise you that. I'll protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape. We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust.
Every day, my presidency will defend American families. We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of. They're not losing their jobs. We're creating those jobs. We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders.
Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly -- daily, hourly -- violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently.
What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? ""Keep it open."" Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I've been there many times. I see what's happening. I don't like it. But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do -- and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases -- the job they do is incredible.
These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing.
And the paper doesn't write about it. The news doesn't write about it. In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that -- arrests. I'm not talking about people coming in. I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder.
Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it. It's dangerous. It's hard. But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders.
These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we don’t want them. We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years. You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years.
And all the nonsense you hear about ""the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have"" -- it's not true, folks. Okay? It's false. It's false propaganda. Right? One recent study from FAIR -- F-A-I-R -- found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents.
Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering. The number of illegals -- far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world.
Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly -- so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy.
Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word ""rape."" The press went after me; I couldn't believe it. I said, ""Will it be like this always?"" The answer was yes.
It even got worse. From day one, I mention the word ""rape."" If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico -- and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our -- I wish Mexico would stop them.
Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border. I wish Mexico would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We're working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing.
But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by the Border Patrol. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans -- you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people.
But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. ""And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to America?"" ""Uh, murder."" She goes, ""What?"" ""Murder."" I mean, what's going on is incredible. And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to -- I've cut it way back.
I've cut it way back. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? ""Oh, let's send our best people up to America. Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people."" No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people.
People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they're smart. It's so sad to see how stupid we've been. Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago.
Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people -- and they're good people -- some senators, mostly -- I tell you, the House has been fantastic.
The House -- you know, backing we've had from the House has really been -- I'm talking about in the last short period of time. There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent.
That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want. They're going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That's the best way to stop that. They're going to do it anyway. They'll do it anyway.
I watch -- good people, they're friends of mine, ""We're very concerned with setting precedent."" That's ""precedent"" not ""president. ""We're very concerned about setting precedent."" I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country.
That's what I'm concerned about. And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you -- they don't like it when I say it -- but we are being invaded. We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals.
And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon.
And you know what? That's okay. In Lebanon -- it's good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people.
And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border.
We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities.
And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, ""Get the hell out of here."" We have to take them through court.
So we catch them. We talk to them. If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them. We say, ""Come back for a hearing in front of a judge."" You know how many judges you need to do this? We have 900,000 people backlogged. That's the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. Three percent of the people come back for a trial.
It's insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such -- you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks.
It's so broken. It's so sad to see. It's incompetent. It's laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico. From China. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. ""Welcome to the United States"" for hopefully 90 years. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen.
This is like crazy. They used to call it ""anchor babies"" but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by one, we're finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws -- loopholes. Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole.
Okay. They can't act. They just can't act. The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it. Visa lottery -- that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, ""Oh, here's a wonderful person. Wonderful."" You know, he killed four people.
Here's -- here's another wonderful. He just robbed a store and killed somebody."" How is that possible? Because they send us the people they don't want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations.
Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from the day they come in until the day they die. We can't do that as a country.
We can't afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that's going to be good for us in 2020. They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion.
Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor -- a Democrat -- stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside.
He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb -- long outside of the womb -- they will execute the baby after birth.
They will execute the baby after birth. And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it. By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.
They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But -- but -- big but -- they always stick together. And the Republicans don't remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have 47. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.
Too many. And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help. He doesn't need it. I say, ""Mark, do you need any help?"" ""No, I'm okay. They're okay. These guys -- you know a funny thing? The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers -- like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them.
I don’t want to -- I could just name so many. They're the ones that win with that. I mean, it's like they don't even have an election. It's the ones that sort of -- they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered.
But the good news is they're all starting to find that out. Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory.
We won for 51. And two that we didn't like got out. They said they retired. They didn't retire. They were retired. They said, ""These two senators have decided to retire."" No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about 5 percent? Any percent. No, we did great.
We had 53 we picked up in the Senate. They were going to win the Senate, remember? And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say ""Donald Trump suffered a big defeat."" First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges -- you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important.
I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, ""Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat."" I said, ""I wasn't running."" You know, not all our candidates were exactly great.
Let's face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what's happening when I do run. And what they don't say is -- governor of Ohio, great guy. Mike. Mike. Mike was down six. He won by seven with one day. Right? He was down by six. One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech.
Jim Jordan was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by six; he won by seven. One day. Then we have Georgia -- the governor of Georgia. Great guy. Where's Georgia?
Great guy. He was losing in the primary by 10. I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue -- two great guys. ""Could you endorse him?"" I said, ""Let me check."" And I checked him. He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper."" He's down by 10. He won by 40. Can you believe that?
I endorsed him, Mark. He won by 40. Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic. It's Democrat. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use ""Democratic."" I even like -- I hate to say in the speech, the ""Democrat Party"" because it doesn't sound good.
But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't. Rhetorically, it's much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I didn't think she was great. But she's their star.
And who showed up? Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama.
And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was Trump. True. We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys -- they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly.
I was so angry. But we had 55,000 people show up. I said, ""You're going to win the election."" He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020. And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others. And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis -- a friend.
A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida. But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt. He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia.
Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. My wife said, ""You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling."" I said, ""That's right. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That's why I like Mark. That's why I like Mark Levin.
And I'm not sure a lot of people like him. He's tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have Florida. So, Ron DeSantis is at three. Three. He calls up, ""Sir, can I have your endorsement?"" I said, ""Ron, you're at three. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner -- has 22 million in the bank.
His poll numbers are very good. He's up in the 20s or 30s."" I said, ""Ron, don't make me do this, Ron."" ""All right, Ron. Here we go."" Because I know if he loses -- which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election.
Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, ""I didn't know Trump endorsed him."" But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, ""Ron, don't do it."" I said, ""All right, I'll do it."" He went from 3 to 60. To 60. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into Florida.
He had money all over the place. And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida. And I could mention many others -- other governors, many other states. But I'm not going to bore you with it. And I think -- I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms.
I think it's incredible. Governor of Florida. Governor of Ohio. Remember, ""You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio."" We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great. Mike. We love you, Mike. As we defend American values at home, we are also defending. American security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything.
And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.
And we got them Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They've hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You couldn’t fire them. You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing. You couldn't fire them. I got a bill passed: VA Accountability.
Now you look at the guy, you say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out."" Nobody thought we could get it. For 40 years they tried to get it. For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it. And VA Choice, they thought -- for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice.
You couldn’t get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks -- people were dying. People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later. Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills.
They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Very productive.
We get along. We've developed a good relationship -- very good -- and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: ""Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."" You know, they're telling me how to negotiate.
These guys died. One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing. And we haven't given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out.
If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me. I don't like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I don't want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it. But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing.
We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto -- Otto Warmbier -- whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible. And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto.
And it's a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have -- and we've had a lot. We're given no credit. They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being -- these are big mountains.
They were being shoved over three, four inches. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons -- nuclear testing. So much. We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago. Mike Pence was in Hawaii. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies.
We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress. And I really think what we're doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front.
But you see, that's not what happened there. So already, I think we're negotiating. And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It's really a bad thing for them. So we'll see how it all goes.
But I think it's going well. I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I'm not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel.
We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible.
Your organization is incredible. Matt and Mercedes, incredible. You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July. We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America.
I hope you can all come. Fourth of July -- keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. A salute to America. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our American legacy.
And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I'm watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time."" He said, ""I love it. Don't leave."" But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read ""people left"" -- nobody left early.
There hasn't been one person that's left. But when you read it, you just say ""fake news."" This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag.
Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We're hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. I want to thank CPAC. What a job they've done. What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.

King George VI,United Kingdom,2016-04-24,"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,
The developments of the past year have strengthened the resolution of My Peoples and of My Allies to prosecute this war against aggression until final victory. Meanwhile, My Government, in consultation with the Allied Governments, and with the good will of the Government of the United States of America, are considering the urgent problems which will face them when the nations now enduring the tyranny of the oppressor have regained their freedom.
I well know that My People will continue to respond whole-heartedly to the great demands made upon them to furnish My Forces with the instruments of victory, and that they are determined to meet, to the utmost of their power, the needs of the Soviet Union in its heroic conflict.
The United States are furnishing My Peoples and My Allies with war supplies of all kinds on a scale unexampled in history.
My relations with Turkey with whom I have a valued treaty of alliance, remain firmly based on trust and friendship.
I welcome the restoration to his Throne of His Majesty the Emperor of Ethiopia. Thus, the first country which fell a victim to aggression has been the first to be liberated and re-established.
My loyal subjects in Malta continue to face air attack with a fortitude that commands My deepest admiration.
Members of the House of Commons,
You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct of the war.
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,
The fulfilment of the task to which we are committed will call for the unsparing effort of every one of us. I am confident that My People will answer this call with the courage and devotion which our forefathers never failed to show when our country was in danger.
My Government will continue to take all practical steps to sustain the health and well-being of My People under the stress of war.
And I pray that Almighty God may give His blessing to your counsels.
",1941 King’s Speech,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/king-george-vi-1941-kings-speech/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-08-31,"Thank you. It is a great honor to be invited by you, Mr. President. A great, great honor. Thank you.
We had a very substantive, direct, and constructive exchange of ideas over quite a period of time. I was straightforward in presenting my views about the impacts of current trade and immigration policies on the United States. As you know, I love the United States very much and we want to make sure that the people of the United States are very well protected. You equally expressed your feelings and your love for Mexico.
The United States and Mexico share a 2,000 mile border, a half a trillion dollars in annual trade, and one million legal border crossings each and every day. We're united by our support of democracy, a great love for our people, and contributions of millions of Mexican-Americans to the United States. And I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans not only in terms of friendships, but in terms of the tremendous numbers that I employ in the United States and they are amazing people. Amazing people.
I have many friends, so many friends, and so many friends coming to Mexico and in Mexico. I'm proud to say how many people I employ and the United States first, second, and third generation Mexicans are just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular, hard-working people. I have such great respect for them, and their strong values of family, faith, and community.
We all share a common interest in keeping our hemisphere safe, prosperous, and free. No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey on innocent people. When cartels commit acts of violence. When illegal weapons and cash flow from the United States into Mexico or when migrants from Central America make the dangerous trek, and it is very, very dangerous, into Mexico or the United States without legal authorization. I shared my strong view that NAFTA had been a far greater benefit to Mexico than it has been to the United States and that it must be improved upon to ensure that workers, and so important, in both countries, benefit from fair and reciprocal trade. I expressed that to the United States and that of the United States, that we must take action to stem this tremendous outflow of jobs from our country. It is happening every day, and is getting worse and worse and worse and we have to stop it.
Prosperity and happiness in both countries will increase if we work together on the following five shared goals.
Number one: ending illegal immigration. Not just between our two countries, but including the illegal immigration and migration from Central and South Americas, and from other regions that impact security and finances in both Mexico and the United States. This is a humanitarian disaster. The dangerous treks, the abuse by gangs and cartels, and the extreme physical dangers and it must be solved, it must be solved quickly. Not fair to the people anywhere worldwide you can truly say but certainly not fair to the people of Mexico or the people of the United States.
Number two: having a secure border is a sovereign right, and mutually beneficial. We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs, and weapons. Cooperation toward achieving the shared objective, and it will be shared, of safety for all citizens is paramount to both the United States and Mexico.
Number three: dismantling drug cartels and ending the movement of illegal drugs, weapons, and funds across our border. This can only be done with cooperation, intelligence, and intelligence-sharing, and joint operations between our two countries. It's the only way it's going to happen.
Improving NAFTA, number four. NAFTA is a 22-year old agreement that must be updated to reflect the realities of today. There are many improvements that can be made that would make both Mexico and the United States stronger and keep industry in our hemisphere. We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world. Keep it in our hemisphere. Workers in both our countries need a pay raise very desperately. In the United States, it has been 18 years. 18 years and wages are going down. Improving pay standards, and working conditions, will create better results for all and all workers, in particular. There is a lot of value that can be created for both countries by working beautifully together and that, I am sure, will happen.
Number five: keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere. When jobs leave Mexico, the U.S., or Central America, and go overseas, it increases poverty and pressure on social services as well as pressures on cross-border migration. Tremendous pressure. The bond between our two countries is deep and sincere. And both of our nations benefit from a close and honest relationship between our two governments. A strong, prosperous, and vibrant Mexico is in the best interest of the United States and will keep, and help keep for a long, long period of time America together. Both of our countries will work together for mutual good and, most importantly, for the mutual good of our people.
Mr. President, I want to thank you. It has been a tremendous honor and I call you a friend. Thank you.
. Excellent. I have tremendous respect for the President. We were together for quite some time and I think excellent. I was with, as you know, Senator Sessions and Mayor Giuliani and we had a tremendous, more than an hour.
. No, not at all. Look, we want what is good for the United States and he wants what is good for Mexico. We realized from the beginning, its good for both of us, better for both of us actually. John?
. We didn't discuss who pays for the wall. We didn't discuss.
. Nothing like an easy question like that. We discussed the wall, we did not discuss payment of the wall. That will be for a later date. This was a very preliminary meeting. I think it was an excellent meeting. We are, I think we're very well on our way. A lot of the things I said are very strong but we have to be strong. We have to say what is happening. There is crime as you know. There is a lot of crime and there is a lot problems, but I think together we will solve those problems. I really believe that the President and I will solve those problems. We will get them solved. Illegal immigration is a problem for Mexico as well as for us. Drugs are a tremendous problem for Mexico as well as us. I mean it's not a one way street. We will work together and we will get those problems solved.
",Press Conference: Donald Trump in Mexico City,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-mexico-city-august-31-2016
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-11-25,"Ah, okay. Well, we’re going to work on that problem. It’s an honor to have you at the White House, in the Oval Office.
We have meetings coming up in a little while. You have your representatives. I have my representatives. And I think we’re going to have very productive meetings. They’ve ordered some F-35s and some other things. They buy a lot of military equipment from the United States -- the best equipment in the world.
And I look forward to our meeting.
Good.
That’s very interesting. We’ll have to think about that, right? That’s very good. You should tell that to Germany.
Well, we have a big NATO meeting coming up very soon, as you all know. But we’ve had a very, very good relationship, and now we’re going to formalize some things. We -- the relationship we have with Bulgaria has been very strong. Great people. Okay? Thank you.
We’ve been thinking about that for a long time; that didn’t just happen. And I have to protect my warfighters. I’ve been -- gotten -- a lot of people have -- a lot of warfighters and people in the military have thanked us very much. It’s been -- it’s about time. They had one young man in jail for six years.
He had many years to go. And a lot of people think he shouldn’t have been there. And I gave him a pardon. With Eddie Gallagher -- you know that story very well -- they wanted to take his pin away, and I said, “No, you’re not going to take it away.” He was a great fighter. He was the -- one of the ultimate fighters.
Tough guy. These are not weak people. These are tough people. And we’re going to protect our warfighters. And I’ve been given a lot thank-yous, including we just had some very great Special Forces people come to the White House, and they brought Conan. But they were here for themselves also. I wanted to see them.
I wanted to meet them. They gave us a rundown on what happened with al-Baghdadi. And they were incredible. But they were very thankful. Somebody has their back, and it’s called the “President of the U.S.” Okay? We’ve got their back.
Say it?
Well, we have a great friendship. They’re great people. You have a lot of people from Bulgaria that are in this country, live in this country. They’ve become citizens of the United States. And we’re going to be talking about the visa program, as per the request of your Prime Minister. But, no, they’re great people.
We have a very good relationship.
No, I think what I’m doing is sticking up for our armed forces. And there’s never been a President that’s going to stick up for them and has, like I have, including the fact that we spent two and a half trillion dollars on rebuilding our armed forces. And some very unfair things were happening. You let Sergeant Bergdahl go. You let others go, including a young gentleman, now a person who President Obama let go, who stole tremendous amounts of classified information.
And you let that person go. But Sergeant Bergdahl -- we just lost another man who went after -- you know he died last week. He went after -- from -- he was paralyzed from just about the neck down, and he died last week, going after Sergeant Bergdahl, trying to find Sergeant Bergdahl. So when you have a system that allows Sergeant Bergdahl to go, and you probably had five to six people killed -- nobody even knows the number, because he left -- and he gets a slap on the wrist, if that; and then you have a system where these warriors get put in jail for 25 years -- I’m going to stick for our warrior.
I will stick up for the warriors. Okay, thank you very much everybody.
The person I’m talking about is Chelsea Manning, by the way, if you had any doubt. So you have Chelsea Manning, who after -- after Chelsea Manning was, I assume, pardoned by President Obama, Chelsea Manning went around and badmouthed President Obama, on top of everything else. So when you have a Chelsea Manning who stole classified information and did many, many things that were not good and gets pardoned -- or whatever happened -- and you have a Sergeant Bergdahl who gets -- virtually nothing happens; a slap on the wrist -- and then they want to put these warriors in jail for 25 years.
One of them, Lorance, served six years in jail; had many years left as a fighter. No, we’re not going do that to our people.
Oh, I don’t know. Rudy is a great guy. Rudy was --
Rudy was the -- and he covered that himself. You know that. Rudy is -- Rudy is the best mayor in the history of New York. In my opinion, the strongest mayor, the best mayor. Rudy is a great crime fighter, corruption fighter. Probably the best in 50 years. When he was here, and also when he was at the U.S. Attorney in Southern District, he was phenomenal.
Rudy is a great person. And I think that maybe the press isn’t treating Rudy very well, and I think that's unfair. But Rudy was a great mayor and a great crime fighter. Thank you very much.
What?
Well, I might come. I might come. It's a country where we have a lot in common. And we have a Prime Minister that we like a lot. So, that could happen. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
By the way, USMCA, I can tell you it’s sitting on Nancy Pelosi's desk.
Wait, please.
Please. Please. Please. USMCA -- that's the deal -- the trade deal, the great trade deal for the farmers, manufacturers, workers of all types, including union. It's sitting on Nancy Pelosi's desk. She's incapable of moving it. It looks like she can't. Everybody knows it's a great deal. She knows it's a great deal; she said it. She keeps saying she wants to get it done, but we're talking about many, many months sitting on her desk, no votes.
And she doesn’t have to help with the Democrats because they're going to vote for it -- most of them. And, I guess, all of the Republicans are going to vote for it. But the system is -- the way the system works, she has to put it up for a vote. And she hasn’t wanted to do it because I understand a couple of the unions -- AF of L-CIO -- they are asking her to hold it for a while because maybe you'll look -- make Trump look bad, although I get a lot of votes out of the AF of L-CIO, except for maybe the top, who I actually like.
Richard Trumka -- nice guy. But Nancy Pelosi should put it up for a vote because, at some point pretty soon, you're going to have Canada and you're going have Mexico say, ""What's going on? Send the agreement back. Let's not make the deal."" And I wouldn’t blame them at all. And that’s okay. We'll just blame Nancy.
She's got to put U.S. -- that's United States-Canada-Mexico trade deal -- a phenomenal deal for our farmers, for everybody. It's a great deal for our country. It replaces one of the worst trade deals ever made -- that’s NAFTA. So, we have a great deal. She has to put it up for a vote. She doesn’t have to talk to anybody.
All she has to do is say, ""We're putting it up for a vote,"" like immediately. And a lot of time is being wasted. But you're going to have Mexico and Canada pull it pretty soon. And if they do, it's her fault, not mine. We gave you a great deal. It's her fault. And got to get going. Got to get going. She's really traumatized.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody.
Huh?
Good. Cute, huh? Unbelievable. More friendly -- more friendly than I thought. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

Barack Obama,United States of America,2012-06-13,"On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House on this beautiful summer evening.
The United States is fortunate to have many allies and partners around the world. Of course, one of our strongest allies, and one of our closest friends, is the State of Israel. And no individual has done so much over so many years to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer as the leader that we honor tonight -- our friend, Shimon Peres.
Among many special guests this evening we are especially grateful for the presence of Shimon’s children -- Tzvia, Yoni and Chemi, and their families. Please rise so we can give you a big round of applause.
We have here someone representing a family that has given so much for peace, a voice for peace that carries on with the legacy of her father, Yitzhak Rabin -- and that's Dalia. We are grateful to have you here. Leaders who’ve helped ensure that the United States is a partner for peace -- and in particular, I'm so pleased to see Secretary Madeleine Albright, who is here this evening. And one of the great moral voices of our time and an inspiration to us all -- Professor Elie Wiesel.
The man, the life that we honor tonight is nothing short of extraordinary. Shimon took on his first assignment inBen-Gurion’s Haganah, during the struggle for Israeli independence in 1947, when he was still in his early 20s. He ran for President of Israel -- and won -- when he was 83.
By the way, I should mention that I just learned that his son-in-law is also his doctor. And I asked for all his tips.
Shimon has been serving his nation -- and strengthening the bonds between our two nations -- for some 65 years, the entire life of the State of Israel. Ben-Gurion and Meir, Begin and Rabin -- these giants of Israel’s founding generation now belong to the ages. But tonight, we have the rare privilege in history -- and that's to be in the presence of a true Founding Father.
Shimon, you have never stopped serving. And in two months we’ll join our Israeli friends in marking another milestone -- your 89th birthday.
Now, I think Shimon would be the first to tell you that in the ups and downs of Israeli politics, he has been counted out more than once. But in him we see the essence of Israel itself -- an indomitable spirit that will not be denied. He’s persevered, serving in virtually every position -- in dozens of cabinets, some two dozen ministerial posts, defense minister, finance minister, foreign minister three times. Try that, Madeleine. And now, the 9th President of Israel. And I think President Clinton would agree with me on this -- Shimon Peres is the ultimate ""Comeback Kid.""
And he’s still going -- on Facebook, on You Tube --  connecting with young people; looking to new technologies, always ""facing tomorrow."" Recently, he was asked, ""What do you want your legacy to be?"" And Shimon replied, ""Well, it’s too early for me to think about it.""
Shimon, you earned your place in history long ago. And I know your work is far from done. But tonight is another example of how it’s never too early for the rest of us to celebrate your legendary life.
Shimon teaches us to never settle for the world as it is. We have a vision for the world as it ought to be, and we have to strive for it. Perhaps Shimon’s spirit comes from what he calls the Jewish ""dissatisfaction gene."" ""A good Jew,"" he says, ""can never be satisfied."" There is a constant impulse to question, to do even better. So, too, with nations -- we must keep challenging ourselves, keep striving for our ideals, for the future that we know is possible.
Shimon knows the necessity of strength. As Ben-Gurion said, ""An Israel capable of defending herself, which cannot be destroyed, can bring peace nearer."" And so he’s worked with every American President since John F. Kennedy. That’s why I’ve worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu to ensure that the security cooperation between the United States and Israel is closer and stronger than it has ever been -- because the security of the State of Israel is non-negotiable, and the bonds between us are unbreakable.
Of course, Shimon also knows that a nation’s security depends not just on the strength of its arms, but upon the righteousness of its deeds -- its moral compass. He knows, as Scripture teaches, that we must not only seek peace, but we must pursue peace. And so it has been the cause of his life -- peace, security and dignity, for Israelis and Palestinians and all Israel’s Arab neighbors. And even in the darkest moments, he’s never lost hope in -- as he puts it -- ""a Middle East that is not a killing field but a field of creativity and growth.""
At times, some have seen his hope and called Shimon Peres a dreamer. And they are right. Just look at his life. The dream of generations, after 2,000 years, to return to Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people -- Shimon lived it. The dream of independence, a Jewish State of Israel -- he helped win it. The dream of an Israel strong enough to defend itself, by itself, against any threat, backed by an ironclad alliance with the United States of America -- he helped build it.
The dream of making the desert bloom -- he and his wife Sonya were part of the generation that achieved it. The dream of the high-tech Israel we see today -- he helped spark it. That historic handshake on the White House lawn -- he helped to create it. That awful night in Tel Aviv, when he and Yitzhak sang a Song for Peace, and the grief that followed -- he guided his people through it. The dream of democracy in the Middle East and the hopes of a new generation, including so many young Arabs -- he knows we must welcome it and nurture it.
And so it falls on each of us -- to all of us -- to keep searching, to keep striving for that future that we know is possible, for the peace our children deserve.
And so it is a high honor for me to bestow this statesman, this warrior for peace, America’s highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And I’d ask you to please join me in welcoming President Peres to the presentation.
The President of the United States of America awards this Presidential Medal of Freedom to Shimon Peres. An ardent advocate for Israel’s security and the cause of lasting peace, Shimon Peres has devoted his life to public service. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the profound role he played in Middle East peace talks that led to the Oslo Accords, and he continues to serve the Israeli people with courage and dignity. Through his unwavering devotion to his country and the cooperation of nations, he has strengthened the unbreakable bonds between Israel and the United States.
From my earliest youth, I have known that while one is obliged to plan with care the stages of one's journey, one is entitled to dream, and keep dreaming, of its destination.A man may feel as old as his years, yet as young as his dreams.
Shimon, to all our friends here tonight, and to our fellow citizens across America and Israel -- may we never lose sight of our destination. Shalom, and may we always be as young as our dreams.
L’chaim. Cheers.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-03-08,"Good morning.
Well, I'm not doing it this morning, Mika. You know, you do always ask me that question. And I said I would have it in due time. And I have been meeting with some tremendous people and I haven't made exactly my decision yet, but you'll have it in due time.
Yes, there is a team. There's not a team. I'm going to be forming a team. I have met with far more than three people, and I will be forming a team at the appropriate time.
Well, I think Senator Jeff Sessions as an example, who wasn't on board the last time I spoke to you, because he just endorsed me last week, but I think he is a prime example. He is highly respected as senator, and he is somebody I have a lot of respect for. And that would be one to start off it. In addition to that, I'm dealing with numerous other people and I will be making a decision over the fairly short period of time.
Right.
Boy, is that a stretch. Wow, that's amazing that would even be brought up. Of course not. Of course not. That's ridiculous. This is the first I've heard of it this morning. I was on the Today Show and they mentioned it and I said, what is going on here? I think it's ridiculous.
It's absolutely -- you know, I have these massive rallies. We have 25,000 people at some of them -- and more. And we're having actually a great time, considering the subject matter is not so good, meaning the country is not doing well.
And I say, and jokingly, raise your hand if you want to -- if you swear to endorse me and swear to go vote for me.
And the entire place practically, laughing and having a good time, raises their hands. They're just -- they're raising their hand in the form of a vote, not in the form of a salute. That is crazy. That is crazy.
I can't believe that's even being posed.
Well, a little bit on Facebook and Twitter, but also we've put up some ads and they're good ads. And spending a couple of million dollars, maybe a few million dollars, I don't know what the final determination is, but they're up.
We already have ads that are up. And I -- you know, we'll find out if they're effective. But certainly, the establishment is just hammering me with ads. Everybody. Because, you know, I had the big tournament at Doral this week where Adam Scott won. And you know, I am watching the tournament. And I see, during the ad portion I see ads against me, and I am the one having the tournament. I own Doral. So, it's sort of a weird feeling.
But no, they're spending a lot of money on that.
The good news is I'm up against a senator who frankly is very unpopular in Florida. He doesn't vote, he doesn't go and vote. And I think if he actually ran for an office there, he wouldn't be elected as dog catcher, honestly.
Well, you know, I have always gotten along with along with people, I think you understand that. I have always gotten along; I've had great relationships with people over the years.
And I -- you know, I've had feuds and I've had fights with people and I have been able to get along. We'll have to see. I think we can.
The bottom line is, you know, the biggest story in politics is how many people are showing up to these primaries. I mean, you know, there are 50, 60, 70 percent, millions of additional people over four years ago. Four years ago, they were dying, the Republicans, and now it's been energized. And you know, instead of being given credit, they take ads against me. And I will tell you, if I am out -- if for some reason I'm out, you will lose millions and millions of potential voters out of the Republican Party and I don't think there's any track -- any way that the Republicans can win.
Frankly, if you take all of these new energized people -- people come up to me, Mr. Trump
You know, it's the biggest story in politics what's happening with the Republicans and I've done a great job and I'm not being given credit, instead they take ads against me. And you know, the funny thing is if they're successful and if I don't win, all these people are going away, Joe, these millions and millions of people. They're not going to vote for Rubio, they're not going to vote for Ted Cruz.
I don't know, Joe. I don't even want to think about it now. I mean, to be honest, I'm the front runner by quite a bit. CNN had me at 49 the other day, 49 to 15, I think 15 and 15 for the two of these guys. I hear Rubio is getting out. There was big stories all over the place that Rubio is getting out. I don't know if he's getting out. He probably should. He hasn't won hardly anything. He probably should get out and he's not popular. I mean, he's not popular in his own state. He's taken -- he's really defrauded his own people because he said he was going to be a senator and he doesn't go and vote.
So you know, we'll see what happens.
Well, I gave a lot of money to charity. I could release a list. I don't talk about my tax rate because I'm under audit but when the audit's finished, I'll give you my tax returns. I have also filed full financials with the Federal Elections Commissions and it's almost 100 pages, so you have my full financials talking about all of the things you have to talk about, including worth and all of those things, cash flows, worth, very little debt, tremendous cash flow, great company, some of the greatest assets in the world, which frankly you can't learn about from a tax return. You can't learn -- honestly, you can't learn very much from a tax return, almost -- frankly, almost nothing. But I filed my financial statements with the Federal Elections Commission.
OK. Thank you very much.

Eric Pickles,United Kingdom,2015-11-25,"Conference chums,
Nearly three years on and we are still clearing up the mess left by Labour.
They certainly knew how to trash the economy.
Labour left us with the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime history.
They created a something for nothing culture.
They allowed the benefit bill to double.
Under Labour, more taxpayers’ money was spent on welfare than on defence, education and health combined.
Having trashed our economy, the ones responsible –
Ed Miliband and Ed Balls –
like grumpy adolescents are in denial, refusing to apologise for the mess and the misery they left behind.
We are taking bold action to turn Britain around.
It means that all the tough decisions were left for us to take.
Thanks to George Osborne’s action in reducing the deficit by a quarter so far, mortgage rates are at record lows – helping families with the cost of living.
Local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending.
Our Town Halls have done an excellent job in rising to that challenge.
Take Tory Trafford.
They’ve protected their libraries, whilst Labour in next-door Manchester is closing them.
Take Conservative Cotswold.
A district cutting council tax by five per cent and freezing service charges. Sharing a Chief Executive with West Oxfordshire.
Take Conservative Lancashire.
The county is cutting council tax by two per cent, funding 48 new Police and Community Support Officers, and cutting management and administration by £215 million.
By contrast, it’s Labour councils that have used frontline services and the poor as battering rams against the government.
Take Labour-run Newcastle.
They announced they wanted to abolish every single penny of arts funding.
They were soon rumbled for playing cheap political games.
This is a council which wanted to abolish the arts, but spend a quarter of a million pounds a year on bankrolling a militia of trade union officials in their town hall.
Labour councils charge high taxes.
They fail to deliver value for money.
And they pour taxpayers’ cash down the drain on bad spending.
Come May, our message is clear:
Don’t let Labour do your council what they’ve done to our country.
Now, if you listen to Labour, you’d think that making savings in local councils meant the end of the world.
Actually, councils are still spending 114 billion pounds a year.
Like a doom-monger consulting his Mayan calendar, their Shadow Fire Minister has predicted deaths, arson and chaos.
And in reality, you know what?
Latest figures show fire deaths are down 19%.
Fire incidents are down 37%.
And arson is down 46%.
Why?
For starters, we are tackling the causes of fires through prevention, like our award-winning Fire Kills education campaign.
We are telling people simply to check their smoke alarm when they turn forward their clocks next week.
A practical way to save lives.
And fire authorities can save more money from public service reform, through more joint working, better procurement, ending old fashioned practices and doing more for less.
The Labour leader of Birmingham City Council has predicted “the end of local government as we know it”
Well, after three years of savings in town halls across the country, you know what?
Research by Ipsos MORI found that two-thirds of residents have not noticed any changes to the quality of council services.
And according to the Local Government Association’s own polling, residents’ satisfaction with their council tax has increased.
Three of out of four residents are happy with their council.
The LGA found that people felt that councils had become more accountable and more responsive.
Councils are demonstrating better value for money, and focusing on the issues of greatest importance to local people.
Save more and get a better council.
Despite the fact that Alistair Darling was planning £52 billion of cuts, Labour have opposed every single saving that my department is making.
All they offer is weak leadership and failed old ideas.
Whitehall could learn a lot from local government.
There’s still far too much waste and inefficiency.
As Ronald Reagan declared:
“The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government and I’m here to help.”
I hope my department has been a beacon to others on how we can protect the taxpayer pound.
My department is making a 41 per cent cut in real terms on its running costs.
That’s net savings of over half a billion pounds from administration alone.
Cutting spending may be a challenge, but it is also an opportunity to work better.
In Whitehall, my department is actively supporting small and medium firms.
We have trebled the amount of contracts they receive, so they now receive a quarter of all our procurement spending.
We have opened a “Pop Up Shop” on the ground floor of my department.
We have sub-let our vacated space to Oftwat, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, even High Speed 2.
We’re not fussy, we’ll take their money.
The Pop Up Shop is just the start.
Given our location in Victoria, our whole ground floor has great potential for retail – maybe a Pound-stretcher?
Now, our building has a secret.
A secret hidden by civil servants for years, in a way that would make MI5 proud.
Within our basement,
Hidden from public view,
Next door to the emergency bunker,
Just below the Harriet Harman Tranquillity Suite,
Lies… A secret pub.
Officially called the DETR Darts Bar.
Known to others as… The Prezza Arms.
Backed up by secret subsidies, it charges just £1.90 for a small bottle of Chardonnay.
That’s what I call minimum pricing.
Now we’re the department in charge of supporting community pubs.
But there are eight licensed premises within 30 seconds of our front door, so why do we need a government pub?
The bar has fond memories of Prezza.
Mrs Pickles rest assured – I’ve not been frequenting it with civil servants.
But sorry John. It’s a dinosaur. It’ a reminder of another age.
So I’ve called time.
The Prezza Arms has served its last Tia Maria.
The public don’t want to see politicians guzzle cheap drink at their expense.
The House of Commons and its Labour MPs should take note.
The nationalised pub is a symptom of how the state over-reached itself under Labour.
Well, along with our secret pub going, we’ve cut quangos like the Government Offices for the Regions, the Regional Assemblies and the Regional Development Agencies.
Labour’s whole tier of regional government has been abolished.
The Government Office for London has literally been razed to the ground.
Is our great city of London now rudderless?
No. We have local leadership from local councils and from Boris, London’s local mayor.
I am not asking councils to do anything that we haven’t done ourselves
According to the Institute for Government, my department has cut the most from its own Whitehall budget.
Staff levels are down a third, but when we restructured, we did it quickly and we started at the top.
We’ve kept our word:
communities have new rights,
councils have new powers.
residents the power to stop council tax hikes.
We have reversed the trend of decline.
From this April; councils will raise 70 per cent of their income locally, and decide how to spend it locally.
Councils which back local enterprise build more homes and support hard work will go far and be quids in.
We are ending the begging bowl mentality, when councils fell over themselves to appear the most deprived, to go cap in hand to the man in Whitehall.
Yet Labour councils are failing to seize the new opportunities that localism offers.
The Mayor of Liverpool says “he fears the worst” and predicts riots.
That’s not a confident message about why firms should invest in Liverpool.
He’s running his council down and letting his residents down.
To help councils, I’ve published best practice advice on how councils can reduce spending: 50 ways to save.
Across the country, there is £2.4 billion of uncollected council tax.
And you know the council with the worst record in the country?
Liverpool.
With £114 million of arrears – equivalent to £500 per home.
They should take time out from scaremongering and get their own house in order.
Councils are losing £2 billion a year on fraud.
Procurement fraud alone costs almost £1 billion.
Practical steps to stop being the victim will cut the cost of being in business.
Did you know that reserves which have been increasing in recent years whilst Labour councils plead poverty?
Councils should use their £16 billion of reserves creatively to invest to save.
All government could save billions from combining services to remove duplication and overlap.
If every council followed the sharing of back office services being championed by the Conservative Tri-Borough initiative in London, they could save £2 billion a year.
These are big sums.
But there are smaller savings which councils can make. Every penny adds up.
Councils should scrap the trade union pilgrims who leech of the public sector.
I’ve no problems with trade unions – but the taxpayer shouldn’t have to foot their bill.
This subsidy of Trade Unions is called “facility time”.
In my department, I can announce we are going to lead the way in Whitehall by facilitating it down to private sector levels.
And we are going to abolish Check-off.
No – not the Russian playwright whose plays are so gloomy that it’s like an evening with Vince Cable.
I mean the bizarre Whitehall practice of the government departments collecting the union subscriptions on behalf of the unions’ barons for free.
Well, the unions can now set up a direct debit like everyone else.
Left-wing councils should scrap their council newspapers like Greenwich Time or Tower Hamlet’s East End Life.
We don’t need municipal horoscopes, town hall TV listings or a weekly edition of Pravda-style propaganda from town hall rags.
Nor do we need the likes of Labour councils paying lobbyists to lobby government. What a waste.
And on lobbyists, let me say this.
The practice of councillors taking money to lobby their own council is wrong.
There will be zero tolerance of corruption on my watch.
A blind eye was turned to back-handers to the police for too long under Labour.
Well, councillors who take brown paper envelopes should expect to go to jail.
And those who offer such brown paper envelopes should expect to join them.
Her Majesty’s Prison Service welcomes crooked politicians with open arms.
Conference,
Conservatives are on the side people who work hard and want to get on.
And that includes people who have come to our country with ambition and drive.
From Beijing to Mumbai, parents with ambition insist their children learn English. We British should be the same.
I’m proud to live in a country that Christians, and Jews, and Muslims, and Hindus, and Sikhs, and people of no faith, join together to celebrate their Britishness:
– respect for the law
– respect for free speech
– respect for democracy
And have the united desire to do better.
But that can’t happen if we don’t nourish the one thing that unites us all – the English language.
Without a common language community cohesion is undermined, creating economic and social isolation, fuelling, rumours lies and extremists.
Councils that translate documents into multiple foreign languages are doing no one any favours.
So I issued guidance last week to town halls reminding them that there is no requirement to translate literature or signs into foreign languages.
As well as our culture, a big part of what defines our communities is local high streets, shopping parades and local corner shops too.
So we have doubled small business rate relief and cut corporation tax.
But there’s one area where we need to do far more for local shops.
Parking.
13 years of Labour’s war on the motorist have created an over-zealous culture of parking enforcement.
Extending CCTV, not to catch criminals, but to catch you out the moment you park on a yellow line.
A rigid state orthodoxy of persecuting motorists out of their cars, with no concern about its effect in killing off small shops.
Officious parking wardens move in faster than a Liberal Democrat on the M11.
This needs to change.
Councils should allow more off-street parking spaces, to take pressure off the roads.
They should end dodgy town hall contracts which reward and encourage the proliferation of fixed penalty notices.
I believe we need to give people the good grace to pop into a local corner shop for 10 minutes, to buy a newspaper or a loaf of bread without risking a £70 fine.
This is of course heresy to the left.
Rather than cutting red tape, their answer to every problem is higher taxes.
Rather than making it easier to park, Labour councils want to hike taxes on supermarkets, pushing up the cost of living.
And Labour are eyeing up your home too.
On top of stamp duty, income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and council tax, Labour want a new house tax.
Does anyone believe a politician who says the tax will only be for the bigger, more expensive homes?
Their new homes tax would let Ed Miliband send government snoopers into your house and tax your patio, conservatory and home improvement.
Little Brother even wants to tax your children’s tree house.
Rather than climbing new heights to tax people, we should be cutting taxes.
And we’ve done that with council tax.
Under Labour, council tax more than doubled.
But over the last three years, thanks to our council tax freeze, we will have cut council tax by almost 10 per cent in real terms.
Now, no-one likes paying council tax, but we’re making it easier to pay.
Residents now have a new legal right to pay over 12 months if you wish.
It’s a practical way to help families and pensioners with their cash flow.
It will bring down families and pensioners’ monthly outgoings by around £24 for most of the year.
And this on top of our council tax freeze which is saving families over £200 a year.
Conference,
We may be in Coalition with our yellow chums, but we are delivering Conservative policies and Conservative principles.
A smaller state and one that is more accountable to local taxpayers.
A freer state, standing up for the little guy in the face of state bureaucracy.
And a lower tax state, helping families with the cost of living and putting more money back to your pocket.
Labour offers no solution other than more spending, more borrowing and more debt.
Only Conservatives, with David Cameron’s strong leadership, are dealing with the big challenges that our country faces.
Clearing up the mess left by Labour, and turning our country around for the better.

Very good.
Very good.

Now you have these people like, 12 people, 14 people, they sit around the table they say, Let's raise it, we have a stupid president heading the United States, he's not going to do anything, let's raise it. Howard, there are so many things you could do. Number one you've got to let them know. Hey, places like Saudi Arabia wouldn't be there if it weren't for us
We protect them.
And you know it's -- it's really -- it's really a very sad situation
You know I often talk about that. ExxonMobil, these two monsters, the two biggest, they get together they merge it's okay but you guys can't merge.
And your stock ain't doing so well.
We've got this great guy Mel wants to do a good job. You know, I mean, you're doing a good job. You got to merge OK merge.
. But he goes crazy every night
About why they're not allowing this merger so
He said it's ridiculous.
Well, it's not my business, Howard. And personally, I don't care, as long as you continue to be on the air. It doesn't make any difference to me whether they merge, although I would like to see Mel do well, so I like it. So I couldn't care less if they merge or not but I will imagine --
Lots of oil lots of lots of ships loaded up with oil and they don't know what to do with it.
You know the part of the problem with this country is a question like that you have to reveal your hand. You don't talk about when you go into a business that you don't talk about, This is what I do. I had an idiot come into my office the other day he says to me, Mr. Trump I'm a great negotiator. I really negotiate well. I read all your books. I'm making a deal with this guy, right? He said, I'm really a great negotiator. I can really negotiate too. Now I've never met a good negotiator that tells you he's a good negotiator. You don't talk about it.
Let's go in and you do your thing. You don't talk about it.
They shouldn't be revealing what they're going to do. I mean I see things the other day where the Pentagon we found out is thinking about attacking Iran and we're going to fly planes here and there then we're going to land them here. We're going to fly and we're going to bomb them at 4:30 in the afternoon. But we may make it at 4:45. This is crazy. What do you think the late great Douglas MacArthur would have done if he heard about something?
Okay. You know look we have a country that's not the same as it used to be Howard it's not respected
Totally downhill. It's not respected. Our leadership isn't respected and frankly, our country is just a different country than it was 10 years ago. Absolutely. You go to Europe you look at the euro it's strong you look at our dollar it's weak it's just really. I mean, as an example, yesterday I closed on a house $100 million.
In Palm Beach.
A very nice Russian gentleman bought a house for a $100 million. Now wouldn't it be nice if an American would give me $100 million instead of a Russian?
It's the foreigners because the dollar is weak.
. In a certain way that's so bad but you know there's something nice about a weak dollar.
In certain ways, it's not so bad for me. Doesn't sound very good but you know there's something good about a weak dollar.
A man, it's a very sad story, about two years ago a man went bankrupt and he had a house in Palm Beach and a house in Palm Beach was a very good house. And I bought it in bankruptcy, I bought it out of a bankruptcy auction.
Forty-one million dollars.
And I fixed it up, you know meaning I painted it.
About $3. No I painted it.
Yeah
I put in a couple of dollars.
And I sold it to a gentleman who's going to, I think rip it down probably and build a bigger house, you know.
Frankly, I don't know what he's going to do.
It's right in the ocean. I should have come to you. You have plenty of money.
No, I didn't.
Now I would say it's a little --
You're off by about $24, 500.
Yeah, that was a good deal. I mean it was a good deal but it's you know it's not my big deal but it's it's like pretty sad when you think of it that most of the people that were negotiating I mean it's a great piece of property
But most of the people negotiating were foreign
She's looking good.
Right, true.
She thinks your fiance is great.
Do you think you're going to invite Melania and Trump to the wedding?
Everybody wants me no matter where it is how they all want Trump, Trump is hot.
So they all want Trump. So, I'm just curious as to whether or not he's inviting me to the wedding.
Now the big question is whether or not I'll go.
Well, the invite would be nice 'coz this way I could say at least I've been invited, and if I don't go you're not gonna mind.
You know I do a lot of times, I'll invite guys like, you know, from -- I would say, well I'm -- he's going to be in Europe closing a big deal. So I have something -- so I invite him knowing he can't come because I don't want him to come. So, I always invite people that I know won't come because it's like having them, you get all the credit for it, but you don't have to suffer through their company.
Oh, he killed me.
You were wrong.
She's a great looking girl.
She is a beautiful girl. But during the wedding and Howard sat right next to O.J. Simpson and in fact, he put me right on the cover, you know me and O.J. At the back cover of his book, which it did very nicely.
But at the wedding I was with Marla, and Marla is, was a really nice girl, you know, but yeah, I made a mistake. But she was great. They have to interview Howard.
So I go back and Marla wants to make love and I want to watch television to see what kind of coverage we're getting.
I knew the marriage was in trouble that first night. When you do that that's not a good sign. You agree with that, Robin?
So, she's in bed saying, Darling, I love you. And I'm trying to find out you know who's on. So the only guy they have, with all these people, big celebrities everybody was there. You would say
I mean even O.J. When he was hot.
Of course you could say he's hotter
In a bad way
Okay, before I talk about O.J. Because I do have to tell you about O.J. And The Apprentice.
NBC went totally crazy when I went to put O.J. In The Apprentice switch.
Howard said that, There wasn't a wet eye in the house. I thought that was her. I cracked up then and it was true. Yeah. That's the sad part, nobody was crying at my wedding.
It was like, you know, the talking, this is great, what a great --
And then he had another comment. Do you remember your other comment?
Six months and you were wrong and you were wrong, it lasted four years.
You were wrong.
Right.
But they have a good relationship and Melania thinks that Beth -- that this is going to be a very good marriage.
What do I know? I would say it probably won't work because they don't work.
Okay, you know, they don't work, it's not because of Howard's or hers. It's because if you look statistically most marriages don't work.
I had a friend
Listen to this. I had a friend always said, Donald, Donald, my wife is great. I got it right. He's not that successful, he goes, You got the big success, but boy, look at my marriage is great. Meantime, I find out the other day his wife is having an affair. Now what do I do?
Wow!
Do I tell him?
Well, I'm I think I'm probably going to tell him, I think I probably already have because he listens so your show, so he probably knows who I'm talking about.
I'm not happy about this.
She'd never go back to you if that happened.
I'm not allowed to do that.
Okay
You know, you sat next to him.
I was friendly with O.J. And I played golf with O.J. And you know when I heard the story about O.J. Because I've seen O.J. Like working out and running and when I heard the story that he wasn't physically capable of beating this very nice young weightlifter.
And a woman.
Because he was 55 years old. O.J. Could be 100 years old and destroy any you know virtually -- I mean O.J. Was a physically strong guy.
And when he was in a rage -- when he was in rage -- I mean this guy knew he was in serious trouble when he was in rage. You forget it. You looked at his eyes and you say, hey, he used to carry for a linebacker you know O.J. Had very skinny legs.
And it was almost like a medical miracle. They say, How come he can carry four linebackers from Pennsylvania on his back nine yards?
No you couldn't, you couldn't bring him down.
So you know, then they say, Oh, he was a little bit older. I mean, you know, he wasn't --
Remember if the glove doesn't fit, right.
I was friendly and I wanted to -- but I must tell you I really abandoned O.J.
I was extremely disloyal.
Well, you know, in your business there's a thing called ratings
And you know you can come up with a cure for cancer.
I found out a lot about your business because hey I'm the biggest star, right?
I am now the biggest star.
I've got the biggest -- You know Melania says you are the biggest star. You are bigger than Tom Cruise, you are bigger than anybody. That's why I like her, okay? Somebody else would say, You're nothing. So I know that if you come up with a cure for cancer.
And if you put it on and if it doesn't get ratings they will not broadcast it.
And it doesn't matter.
Couple of us remember but not too many. But anyway, so you come up with a cure for a disease. Now good. Okay. Now, I know this, if I put O.J. On
Thirty five million people.
I don't want to go into it but O.J. Would have done it.
I can't go into the details.
I refuse to say.
I hadn't spoken to him in years. I don't like people that kill their wives, okay? Does that make sense?
Does that make me a disloyal person?
But I like women.
I don't even like guys that beat up women, you know you got a lot of those guys around, okay?
No, I'm a lover not a fighter.
No, no, no. I'm a lover not a fighter.
Great lover, poor fighter.
No, no. I've had women that wanted to be, Robin. I've had women that wanted to be beat-up.
I've had women that said and I would, you know what I say? I'm sorry darling but that's not my thing.
Smacking is not my thing.
Well I think it would be one way of getting him out of hiding.
You put him on and then the guys come along and finally capture him. By the way. How is it that we can't capture six foot six Arab?
Who's walking in the woods of probably Saudi Arabia, in my opinion. I happen to think he's in Saudi Arabia.
Let me ask you this, do you think the late great Douglas MacArthur, the great general,
He had the whole deal going, right?
. You know in the history of West Point, think of this, he was the greatest student, to this day in the history of West Point,
He had the highest marks ever in the history of West Point. And that's why he never liked you know Eisenhower because Eisenhower was you know he never felt he was an equal. Would you think that the great Douglas MacArthur would have allowed Osama bin Laden to be free this long?
He would have gone into Saudi Arabia and gotten the families of the terrorists. He would have done a lot of different things.
Well, I tell you what, you have to remember one thing, the answer is no, but I have to qualify it. We were lied to by the president. We were told that this is where it all started
We were told that this guy had nuclear weapons, he didn't have an M-1 rifle.
He had nothing.
But Robin, he had nothing.
Yes, so I could fire him quickly.
Don't ask me these questions.J. Let's go back to O.J. it's less controversial.
Well, I have actually, Heather Mills wants to be on very badly.
Heather Mills wants to be on. She's go a tremendous dislike for her husband her husband, her ex-husband
Even though he handed her 60 million bucks. You know I was watching Larry King and he was on and she was on they were holding hands and then she took off her leg and showed her leg and I -- Excuse me, he's a Beatle [Inaudible
No, no. He should have had a pre-nuptial agreement.
He could've given one. He could've given a million. She would have been extremely happy with 1 million.
A lot of money a mean you give somebody a million dollars you get divorced here's a million bucks.
Not a bad idea.
Maybe I'll get Christie Brinkley on.
I'd rather have both.
Yeah, I think he could win. I think he'd kill most of the people on the show.
I know a friend of mine he's a friend of mine a great guy, I won't tell you his name, but he's a big guy. He had O.J. On the board on a board of a charity.
And he, you know, when this happened recently as I said Did you ever said you know O.J. Was a nice guy but every once in a while like if he got into an argument or a disagreement with somebody in the board the rage was unbelievable the board was sitting there they were petrified.
This is a board of stiffs. This is a board of rich stiffs, and O.J. Would get angry and everybody would just shake they didn't know -- And that was before he killed the wife. So you know they had no idea.
Could be.
You know Joan Rivers announced, your friend, right?
She announces she's on. We have -- let me just tell you when we did Celebrity -- Apprentice became a tremendous success. And then last season we did Celebrity Apprentice, which frankly I like more, because you don't have to build up the characters, you know the characters have been there for 25 years, right?
So we did Celebrity Apprentice, it became a tremendous success a ratings. It only matters if it's a ratings you know. I mean when I say Success meaning it's good ratings. You have shows that are unsuccessful in the ratings.
Pierce is great, yeah good guy. And I heard he was very nice. Calls me Mr. Trump like he is a great guy and -- H Good guy. And by the way it took a lot of heat because people didn't think he was a great guy. When I say he's a great guy he's a very smart guy. He deserved to win.
But think of it. He deserved to win he's got his own show. Trace Adkins, nobody ever heard of him, he was a country singer. Country singer Trace Adkins, right? By last year he told me he couldn't get into the Country Music Awards this year he hosted them. Right. So we got to number one record.
Do you think he should give me 20% of everything?
Huh?
I do. How about you, you build people up then make a fortune then they forget you', right?
So everybody wants to be on The Apprentice, so now the problem we have over 100 and you know it's amazing how many celebrities or Howard. You know you think of celebrities like that like for like there's like thousands of them.
No, only the good looking ones.
No. Wouldn't be --
I don't disagree. I'm not knocking Madonna but that wouldn't be for me. There would be zero attraction.
I would not -- I would not do good with her.
Because I wouldn't be attracted to her.
I think I'd have a hard time.
Now I don't find her attractive.
I mean, she's just not for me.
No. I really don't know Madonna, actually. But I mean that wouldn't be my thing.
Do women come up to you and offer themselves to you? they say listen, I want you
They do, in levels of beauty that you wouldn't believe.
And they're really, I mean, some incredible beautiful women that walk up and they'll flip their top and they'll flip the panties.
I had sex with women that got fat.
Many times.
Well, actually I'm attracted to women that are a little chunky
Well, what are you talking about?
Well, 30 pounds I could handle.
You know -- You know I don't even think about sex anymore other than with my wife, Howard.
Sure.
Absolutely.
Can you imagine if I live answer that question, like, no -- Can you believe it? Front page of every frickin newspaper. I find it very content. Officially I am extremely content.
I like that idea.
You know Michael Vick got a bad deal and you know what if you go to the south, and I go to the south, because I have deals and, they have dog things these dog things are all over the place. But then they put him in jail for the rest of his life. I mean the middle of his career
No, they're not legal but you know they have them all over the place. The dog what a fighting.
Dog fighting, cock fighting, everything.
It was stupid and for him to be involved in all that. I'm not a big fan of pit bulls. I've known too many people who were badly hurt by pitt. I know a girl who is beautiful who is taking care of a dog who was a pit bull. The dog ripped her apart. So I'm not a big fan you know these people come out, oh the poor dog the poor dog. These are trained killers these dogs.
So, I'm not, you know, when I had two pit bulls fighting they fight themselves than us.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
No. But I think that this woman was extraordinarily bad breast jobs.
Well, everything looks very beautiful but you know they had the wrong doctor and things like that. So actually it's not so much. Isn't it unbelievable, women are -- one woman beautiful had big beautiful real boobs, really beautiful.
And she wants them reduced.
You get a breast reduction, Robin.
To me, I think to me I think anybody is insane if a woman is, okay I hate to say this Robin,
Well I don't know if you're happy with who but I have never seen a good breast reduction.
I saw a woman --
Really? Well then you have a good doctor because I saw woman who was totally beautiful
She was angry that so many men were calling her. How dare they call me. It's terrible. They're all looking at my breast. So she had a major breast reduction. The good news nobody calls her anymore. And the bad news, nobody even looks. And not only that was a terrible job. I mean she has scars up and down.
I happen to think, so many doctors, you know I'm not a big fan of doctors. I've seen so many doctors destroy people.
You're talking pre-marriage?
If I thought she was a really nice person. I would do everything I can to, you know, because I wouldn't want to insult her. I really would.
I tell you what ha -- I was at Mar-a-Lago and we had this incredible ball the Red Cross ball right in Florida in Palm Beach Florida and we had the Marines, and the Marines were there and it was terrible because you know all these rich people they're only there they're not there they're there to support the Marines. But they're really there to get their picture in the Palm Beach Post, you know the Palm Beach post, you know all the shining shit. So you have all these really rich people and a man about 80 years old, very wealthy man, a lot of people didn't like him, he fell off the stage.
And the Marines were given the worst table the whole place, you know they gave the worst table in the whole place to the Marines and we're celebrating the Marines is like 10 Marines and everybody else has the good table. They don't even know what the Marines are. They never heard of the Marines couldn't tell us how much they are giving $100, 000 a table but they don't even know where the money is going. They couldn't care less. So what happens is this guy falls off right on his face hits his head. And I thought he died. And you know what I did. I said. Oh, my god that's disgusting and I turned away. I couldn't, you know, he was right in front of me. I turned away. I didn't want to touch him.
Now the Marines, he's bleeding all over the place. I felt terribly you know beautiful marble floor didn't look so good. It changed color became very red. And you have this poor guy 80 years old laying on the floor unconscious and all of the rich people are turning white. Oh, my God this is terrible, this is disgusting and you know they're turning away. Nobody wants to help the guy his wife is screaming She's sitting right next to him she's screaming. What happens is these 10 Marines from the back of the room they were so far back you know it's a huge ballroom. Mar-a-Lago, you've been there.
So in the back of the room they come running forward. They grab them. They put the blood all over the place that's all over their uniforms. They're taken at this swipe. They ran them out they created a stretcher they call it a human stretcher but then runs out like five guys at each side. They ran him out. I never saw it.
I would say like, clean up it's disgusting.
That guy forgot to call the next day. I forgot to call to say if he was okay. It's just not my thing. So you know when --
Not even disease I just don't like looking at blood.
Like you know, when these people call me that when I know it's terrible like you know when these people call me like a beautiful girl. I see a beautiful girl. She says, Oh Mr. Trump I want to be a nurse. I said, A nurse? You want to clean up and you want to be a nurse? I respect nurses but you want to be a nurse. Oh, I love it. Mr. Trump. You know it's just menus that's why they have menus in restaurants they're all different.
Well, I mean, I think we all have.
Honestly, the man just said it.
Do I miss it? No.
No, I'm extremely satisfied.
Extremely.
Howard.
Extremely. You know the problem with your show is, I said, you know, I'm supposed to come over here to talk about affliction which is like this big deal, I own a big piece of this company that's putting on fights you know the MMA, speaking of blood, they'd beat the crap out of me.
A lot.
No, a lot.
A lot.
So you can only make love.
And the French also say Jerry Lewis is funny.
No, I think now we just have a very good relationship overall.
I mean, in every way.
Other than the baby takes a little time, right. You know she takes care of the baby. But no I would say it has not.
I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow.
I think -- I think a 125 a piece as opposed to 100.
Have I had in the past?
Haven't we all?
I mean --
Are we babies?
Although I don't like that. I mean I like -- I have one nice, beautiful love affair.
Yes.
Probably the first week into the pregnancy.
Just means you like somebody?
Slash love.
By the way. Excuse me do am I still in your Top 5 in the history of the Howard Stern Show?
That you play back.
A. J.
They say that was the all-time in the history of Howard Stern all-time top. That's pretty good.
And that was great. That was when we were on Sirius.
Well, I tell you I just had the Miss Universe contest, did you see it?
Got very nice ratings. Won the evening.
Hey, Miss America it's in the toilet.
When Miss Universe and Miss USA are doing well.
You know why? Because I pick good looking girls.
Somebody said, How did you do it? I say it's about picking good looking girls.
Some of the guys like a beauty pageant. Isn't that a little old fashioned? I said, Since when do beautiful women get old fashioned? But you know a lot of people like Miss USA I mean,
Somebody said to me how did you make it so successful? I said, Number one, I got the best looking girls in the world. Number two they wear six-inch heels. And number three they were the tiniest suits you're allowed on television.
Whereas Miss America, they had a protest they shouldn't wear high heels. So they wear flats.
. And then they had to wear a big fat bathing suit. So we got very -- Okay, so the girls on the show, I don't -- Did you see it at all?
The best-looking group of women that I've ever seen on a beauty pageant.
And the girl who won was Miss Venezuela.
Doesn't speak a word of English.
And I would say that you -- Well, this -- she can't even say hello.
Well, she does speak I mean, she is very smart. My wife is really smart. I mean she can look at a car or a computer. She can do any -- She can fix the thing before she opens a computer with no instructions, turns it on fixes it, starts it. I said, Don't you have to read the book? She says, No no.
But I'll tell you what, this -- the girl that one from Venezuela.
Well, let me just say that though Jennifer Hawkins, Jennifer Hawkins was Miss Universe three years ago.
She's now the biggest star in Australia.
She was a judge at the contest. The contest of all places was in Vietnam, which was a very nice.
I got a case of the shakes.
I was in Vietnam. Vietnam is a hot country. But you know when I was going to high school when I was going to college Vietnam was like, the big deal. It's like you know you have to leave college and go. I said excuse me now I'm going to Vietnam for beauty pageant.
I didn't go to Vietnam. I actually stayed at home. It was a long trip. I was going to go get my pilot says, Sir, 24 hours. What? Excuse me?
I go to Dubai.
No, I understand life that life is fragile and it's just what it is you've got to do.
No. And I have a good time with my life. You know, I mean, I have a good time. I could lock myself into a nice building. Pick my least conspicuous building. Okay. I'll take my least conspicuous go to my worst location least conspicuous you know. Right. I just lock myself in and take a nice apartment.
But that's not my thing.
I like action, Howard.
Mel Karmazin. Lives in one of the great -- I won't tell you which one because he'll be inundated by his many fans but --
Mel not only does he live in a Trump building but he lived in the Trump building before he moved up. He stepped up in class, he went from one good one to one great one.
Everyone lives in my buildings so, you know.
It's an honor to have Fred.
You know he's very very current.
And you are right and Miss -- Miss Colombia was un --
Kosovo was beyond belief. Actually a couple of our male judges have never returned to the country.
Actually it's become a big betting deal. You know, this is what I need. Okay. But it's become now a big deal. That's good. But the Miss Universe contest now has become a monster. And you know you saw the other day and they just did the ratings thing and it won the evening and the ratings. It does great. It's I got a good look of anger now. I bought a property for peanuts. I made it hot. Is that good?
OK now let's talk about affliction.
Well MMA, mixed martial arts, and I always like it.
You know, I do more boxing than anybody probably. I have Mike Tyson was fought for me, I think 16 times more than anybody else.
Mike Tyson was a great money maker.
Boxing has become cold. But any time you announce a Mike Tyson fight sold out in three seconds, okay? And boxing today is not the same thing. It's fine.
Yeah, I think. All of a sudden you have some hot guy come up, it will be fun. Boxing will always be fun. But the hot thing now is MMA. And we have a company we formed a company with a very, very substantial group of guys. And it's also with Affliction, which is a clothing company, which is a phenomenal company which is hot as a pistol.
It is mixed -- And we have a fight on Saturday night and it's going to be on Pay-per view, Saturday night at the Honda Center, which is sold out, which is --
We have Feidor, the Russian, who's never been defeated. He is -- They say the toughest guy in the world.
Everything. His thing is inflicting death on people.
He's abnormally strong.
He's not that big either. Weighs about 225 pounds. He's fighting a guy who's a great champion who weighs a hundred pounds more and he's like six inches seven inches taller.
And not giving the other guy a great chance they give him a chance but not a great chance. And I said how could this guy who I met because I'm six foot three and I'm probably taller than Feidor. Which in theory would mean I should be able to take him out.
Well I'm not into a street fight I've been. I used to fight a lot in high school.
I actually used to fight a lot. I mean, I almost got thrown out of school a couple of times for fighting.
I was good. I was good. But I really said, in fact I looked at this guy, and there was a group of beautiful women standing there you know there always are, there have a lot of beautiful women. For some reason, it's like 10 people trying to tempt me. But you know a thing like that isn't a possibility.
That's because I'm in love. So there's this beautiful woman and I'm looking -- Wait, and I look at the way I'm looking at this Russian Feidor, with a face like you don't want to touch, with ears like I've never seen before,
Muscles on his -- his shoulders like I've never I've never seen muscles. His neck is like, I think it's 28 inches. I said to the girls let me ask you a question, If I worked out for a little while do you think I could take this guy? They go, Yes Mr. Trump.
Really loving?
Sure absolutely sure. Oh, absolutely. Are you talking about children also?
Well, I have a very deep love for my wife, I do.
It means -- it means a friendship. It means respect. It means you like you really like somebody. You like being around somebody. It means you're like protecting that person.
I'd never go out with another one.
No I wouldn't. I might not.
You know what I hate. When I see a woman and a man married, and a woman is married to a rich guy, right? And then the guy kicks the bucket. He's gone and she's dating the following week.
And now she's living in a mansion you know the beautiful mansion in Palm Beach and the whole thing.
I always say as I go into one of my many houses I say, You know if any guy ever lives in this house I'm going to be looking up at you. I'm going to be cursing you.
Absolutely.
Oh, sure. No problem.
No problem, look at Robin. Look how skinny Robin, how much weight did you lose?
You look great.
I don't need to be with a beautiful woman.
So if Beth gained 100 pounds you wouldn't be with her? You'd drop her?
I'd be I'd be extremely loyal.
Physical doesn't mean anything to me.
Billionaire.
That sounds good.
How about golf?
Coming up Saturday
But we have the best fighters, we have the best fighters in the world and not only Feidor, but we have a whole list of fights that are phenomenal fights and everybody in that world really knows, and they know all the fighters.
Well, I've been doing it all my life.
Well, I've been doing it all my life. I love fights. I mean I -- I love boxing too, but boxing somehow has lost an edge. And you know I don't know something's wrong, sometimes you'll see a match which is so mismatched and then the other guy wins, the one or lost wins and you get tired of it. I've watched too many fights.
Well, this way it's sort of like you just somebody dies. I've never seen anything like that and it's terrible. You know it's not like oh how would the judges voting. Okay, it's like you know somebody just succumbs. Right?
Right. Irish John Go ahead quick for Mr. Trump, quickly. Hi, Mr. Trump.
I mean look, she is, she's a beautiful person she's got every guy calling. I have like a gatekeeper.
She was -- she is but she's actually now she's with a young man who's a great guy. And I don't know what's going to happen. I'm not sure what's going to happen but she has actually got a boyfriend who's a great guy.
Tagging, It's something I can't even think about.
I can't imagine.
Not in this case I mean she's got a very nice guy. So we'll see how much.
Yeah yeah.
She has really become a big star. You know even really before the Apprentice she was doing well. But then I put on the Apprentice and she became amazing.
No. I have all great children. I have five children.
No. They're great. I have Eric and Don.
All the same in the world. Like you two and they're all very different. I mean, they're very different but you know
Nah, that's not even a question I want to answer.
She is very famous.
She's on the cover of every magazine. She's doing great.
No. I just couldn't answer a question like that I mean that's a question you can't even answer. They're all great kids.
Not good.
No I don't. And I don't consider myself a grandfather. I don't even want to hear the term.
My boy?
Oh, it's a granddaughter. Doesn't call me anything. I don't get to see her very much.
I expect to see the child over the next few months. I'll let you know.
I'll pass on that. Let me pass on that show.
True.
Yes.
Anything but Grandpa.
I don't know. I'll train the kid properly.
Actually Don has done very well in The Apprentice also.
My son Don has done very well. But you know it's a little tougher I think for a guy as opposed to a woman.
She was very nice. she got married at Mar-a-Lago and
Yeah. Nice guy.
He came to me they came to me and they said would it be possible for us to use Mar-a-lago? I said, would you pay me $2 million of my money. And they said, Oh, how about a million.
I haven't asked him.
I don't know. I mean he must love her.
Much younger.
I think he married her because he's desperately in love. Ever hear the song desperately and hopelessly in love? I hear that sound from years ago I remember right away and hopelessly in love. That's that's pretty sad when you're desperate and hopeless. Well I think he's desperately and hopelessly in love.
Good.
It's going to watch on Saturday night.
Right.
Correct. Seriously tough people.
Correct.
Correct.
Not dislike. I disrespect and I think he's doing a terrible job.
He's hopefully going to be fired by his own accord pretty soon. You know it's amazing. He lied to this country about really important things like the most important things. Got us into a war that we shouldn't be and we should be. I'm the worst hawk of all. I am -- I am not like a dove. I am the way. But we went to the wrong place Okay. We did go to the red line in Afghanistan. You know Saddam Hussein like them are not like him. He used to kill the terrorists.
He used to kill terror -- If they came into the country he would kill.
So it's you know it's a very very sad situation.
And I tell you what, like this guy, date this guy. When that guy a character with a cell phone took the picture of him before he got hung. There aren't a lot of people that would handle it the way he did. That's why he's cursing at everybody saying you know this and that he's not out there begging saying, Oh, please don't do this please. He's out there as, you know, say what you want. He was one tough cookie.
The best thing that ever happened to him? That cell phone because it showed he has guts.
Well that's not. I mean this is the only one I'm doing I'm not doing anymore that I'm I'm actually having a big closing today. I'm buying something.
I'm buying a big building someplace
Yeah but I can't talk about it because I haven't signed the contract.
Well, it's a great time to buy real estate. This is a great time to buy real estate. There are deals. I used to make speeches and I have thousands and thousands of people show up to speak and for years I'd say don't buy don't buy don't buy now's the time now I say bye bye bye. This is the time to buy. You know, the banks are all out of business. They're going down the tube. I say, Yeah but the financing is already there the banks already put up the money it's a foreclosed building it's a mess. You take back the paper
I put up my money I put up money and you can make good deals today. This is a great time to buy real estate.
Yeah that's what I do.
Yeah that's what I do for a living.
I actually do that for a living.
I do it to do that with a group of sometimes and partnerships and sometimes I don't but you know usually I like to just buy it myself.
Whatever. I rent it, I redevelop it and I sell it.
I'm buying a new club in New Jersey. I'm doing something New Jersey that's going to be amazing. I have this great club that I'm buying that I'm going to make a very very successful.
I already have I bought John DeLorean eight years ago and I turned it into Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster New Jersey and made that a tremendous success.
I have a big thing going and Scotland I have thousands of acres in Scotland. I have thousands of acres in Scotland.
I mean a lot of money.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe more than that.
Would you ever be one of those guys at some point say look I'm old enough. I'm going to give away five billion of my money and I'll be fine with two.
Why I think I'd do that but I'll do that upon death as opposed to when I'm living.
Well I have great kids and they do a good job for me and they work in the business they're really doing.
No. Because you know I just want to do what I'm doing. I don't do it for money I do it because I really love doing it and I'm making money because I do it well.
I wish I was worth more than him.
There is always somebody.
Recently somebody said Bill Gates is now number two. There's always somebody, he can't let that get you.
No. Doesn't matter
Melania.
I get up very early I read the papers in the morning.
Well I read I think The Post does a very good job every time.
The Times, The Wall Street Journal. I see the news. I get a lot of paper.
No. I get up myself. I really don't have anybody. I have like an alarm clock I get up at 4:30.
Toilet.
I don't even think about it. I would say mostly in the standing position.
She wouldn't do a thing like that.
She wouldn't. By the way.
Do you remember when I said one of the most beautiful women in the world Miss Russia. About four or five years ago.
That ruined her that destroyed her. You know she quit Miss Universe after doing a show.
She became Miss Universe and she started asking her questions like this, she quit. But actually I fired her. I said, Oxana, you're fired.
She became impossible after this show.
No but it's something that wouldn't particularly bother me.
Who says she doesn't?
I mean you know we we have a very very good time together.
Well, some of them don't like me for that.
I've run out of names I have towers and castles and everything. I've run out of them. So that's a very fine name.
Howard you have to do me a favor you have to watch on Saturday night.
Right.
Never been defeated ever.
Correct.
I really haven't.
I was never crazy about it, but you know she attacked me and I attacked her back and became this crazy.
Like I said I tried it. I go on The Today Show and Meredith is very nice. Yes. And her friends I'm talking about The Apprentice going on you know the Apprentice is going on in an hour right after the Super Bowl. So she starts off, Donald what about Rosie O'Donnell? I say, What about it? since you guys but do you hate her. And did you call her fat. I said, No. I called her, Degenerate. I didn't use the word fat because it's politically incorrect but I did call her a total degenerate and I did call her a pig. I shouldn't have called her that. She asked me third question about Rosie. Then she said, Can I ask you a question. Why do you always talk about Rosie. Cause you asked me the question.
But you're a very handsome guy actually. Yeah. Nobody knows. Artie's a very good looking. I think that your name is Artie, right?
I think she'd love to date you. Honestly.
Great guy. Great seeing you.
",Interview: Donald Trump on The Howard Stern Show,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-howard-stern-show-july-16-2008
Nicola Sturgeon,United Kingdom,2020-06-02,"Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us.
I’ll start as always with an update on the current position in relation to COVID-19.
As at 9 o’clock this morning, there have been 15,471 positive cases confirmed – which is an increase of 53 from the figures I gave you yesterday. However, I need you to note today that this figure of 53 includes 40 older positive test results, which have only been received today and are being added to the overall total now.
A total of 1,168 patients are currently in hospital with either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and that is an increase of 122 from yesterday.
However, please note that the number of confirmed cases in hospital actually decreased by 23 compared to the figures yesterday.
A total of 34 people last night were in intensive care with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. That is an increase of 7 since yesterday – all 7 of those are suspected cases at this stage, not confirmed cases.
I am also able to confirm today that since 5 March, a total of 3,721 patients who had tested positive and required admission to hospital for the virus have now been able to leave hospital.
And unfortunately, in the last 24 hours, 12 deaths have been registered of patients confirmed through a test as having COVID-19 – that takes the total number of deaths in Scotland, under that measurement, to 2,375. Of course, tomorrow we will have the weekly report from National Records of Scotland which includes confirmed and suspected deaths from the virus.
Each one of these of course is an individual whose loss is being grieved and mourned by many. I want again today, to send my condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one to this illness.
Lastly, on statistics I can confirm that the latest report on delayed discharges has been published today. That includes details on the number of older people discharged from hospitals – where they had no clinical need to be – to care homes. In April that figure was 510. An additional 600 were discharged during April to their own homes.
In addition to thanking our health and care workers – as I do again today from the bottom of my heart – there are two other groups I want to pay tribute to and these groups are relevant to the two substantive issues I want to cover today.
The first group is our unpaid carers, who of course provide vital support to family, friends and neighbours at all times. This pandemic has been an especially stressful time for many of them, and I want to thank each and every one of them, you if you are watching, for your efforts.
One of the ways in which the Scottish Government has already acted to support carers, is by establishing a Carer’s Allowance Supplement – worth £460 a year. The supplement is paid to around 83,000 people across the country who receive Carers’ Allowance – people who are on low incomes, and who provide 35 hours or more of unpaid care to a child, or to an adult on disability benefits.
Last month, we announced that these carers will receive a further Coronavirus supplement of £230. Parliament approved our plans two weeks ago, and so people who are eligible will receive this payment at the end of this month, together with their normal Carer’s Allowance Supplement.
The specific date of payment will be confirmed in the next few days. Let me stress now, if you are eligible, you don’t need to do anything to receive this Coronavirus supplement – it will be paid to you automatically at the end of the month.
I know that this pandemic has been really hard for everyone but it has been very hard for carers emotionally – you are inevitably concerned about your own health, and the health of the people that you are caring for. However in many cases, it has also been very difficult financially. This extra payment is one way of providing you with some additional help – but is also an important way of us acknowledging the help and care that you provide to others.
I also want to acknowledge that this week is Volunteers Week – that’s an opportunity for all of us to highlight and celebrate the service of volunteers in communities the length and breadth of the country.
Of course, like unpaid carers, the efforts of volunteers are important at all times, but the Covid outbreak has demonstrated once again just how much they contribute. The Scotland Cares campaign, which you will recall we launched at the end of March, received more than 80,000 sign-ups in total. More than 60,000 of those were from people who wanted to volunteer through the British Red Cross or through Volunteer Scotland.
Some have been shopping for their neighbours – making sure people get the food and prescriptions and other essentials they need – others have been making befriending calls, or providing emotional support, to isolated or lonely people.
Some are directly helping with the response to COVID-19, and others are volunteering through long-standing community organisations.
There are also some people who signed up who may not have been asked to volunteer yet, but you may well be needed in the future – for example in supporting people who are asked to self-isolate under the “test and protect” system.
And of course, alongside the tens of thousands of people who have signed up under the Scotland Cares campaign, there are hundreds of thousands of people and many of you watching will be amongst that number who have been volunteering for years and in some cases for decades.
There are also, I know, many of you who are maybe not formally recognised as volunteers, but who have been performing important acts of kindness for neighbours and friends for a long, long time. I want to say how grateful I am, and how grateful the Scottish Government is to each and every single one of you.
Our national response to Covid depends on people being prepared to look out for each other and show solidarity with each other. Volunteers are an essential and highly valued part of that collective national effort.
Of course, each and every one of us has a part to play in that effort. And it remains the case, that the best way in which each of us can show solidarity with each other, is by sticking to the rules and the public health guidance.
That is the point I want to end on this afternoon.
You should still be staying at home most of the time right now, and you should still be meeting fewer people than normal.
I’d ask all of you to consider whether or not your life feels as if it is going back to normal? I’m sure that’s not the case but if it is, perhaps you should think about whether you are following all of the public health guidance because unfortunately, and regrettably, our lives shouldn’t feel completely normal right now.
When you do meet people from another household, when you are away from home, you should stay outdoors at all times, and you should stay 2 metres apart from people in other households.
Now you might be reading or hearing in the media today some voices saying that 1 metre is sufficient – so I want to take the opportunity today to stress that the clear and strong advice from the Scottish Government is to stay 2 metres apart from those in other households.
Don’t meet up with more than one other household at a time, don’t meet more than one a day – and please keep to a maximum, and I stress, a maximum of 8 people in a group.
Remember to wash your hands often. That is actually more important as you start to meet, albeit at a physical distance, with people from other households. So wash your hands often and thoroughly. If you’re away from your home, out and about, please remember to take hand sanitiser with you.
Wear a face covering when you are in shops or on public transport. And again, I want to make a direct appeal to you here, if you haven’t been wearing a face covering so far when you’re in a shop or on public transport or in other enclosed spaces, I’m asking you to please think about doing so now. Because it can offer some protection to other people, it protects them from you transmitting the virus to them if you have it perhaps without knowing it and other people who wear a face covering are offering you some protection as well. So again, it’s something all of us can do to protect each other.
Remember to avoid touching hard surfaces – and when you do touch a hard surface remember to clean it.
And if you have symptoms of COVID-19 – a new, continuous cough; a fever; or a loss of, or change in, your sense of smell or taste – you should get tested, and follow the advice on self-isolation.
I want to underline that point today as well. The success of our test, trace and isolate system – Test &amp; Protect – depends on everyone with symptoms coming forward and getting tested.
So if you do experience symptoms – please do not delay – do not do that thing that sometimes in normal times all of us do, wait to see if we feel better after a day or so. The moment you start to experience these symptoms, book a test at nhsinform.scot or you can phone NHS 24 on 0800 028 2816.
It is really important that if you experience those symptoms, a cough, fever, a loss or change in sense of taste or smell then you come forward and book a test.
Above all else, and this is my final point, please remember that the individual decisions that all of us take right now have an impact far beyond our own health and wellbeing – our individual decisions right now affect the wellbeing of our families, our communities, indeed they affect the wellbeing of the entire country.
The Scottish Government’s responsibility to lead the country through this pandemic and to take all of the appropriate practical steps we need to take is a responsibility we and I, personally take very seriously.
But the truth is that our success or failure in suppressing this virus and keeping it suppressed will also depend on all of us as individual citizens and it will depend on our collective efforts as a society.
We must all continue to do the right thing by each other – by following all the rules and following all of the public health guidance.
I want to stress today that if we all do that, we will continue to slow down the spread of this virus and we will save lives. So my thanks to each and every one of you for doing that so far and I ask you to continue to do the right thing.
",2020 Statement on the Coronavirus,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/nicola-sturgeon-2020-statement-on-the-coronavirus-5/
Nancy Pelosi,United States of America,2020-08-23,"Whose district is very affected by it. All of us salute our firefighters and all of them. We just came out of the convention, as you know, and I’m very proud of the values that were presented there. In my remarks I said, “We come together not to decry the darkness, but to light a way forward for our country.” That was my own statement, but I was so pleased that it was so much a part of our president-to-be, our nominee, Joe Biden’s statement.
And so, today, I come to shine a light forward for our postal system. Most people don’t know, or perhaps you do, how significant the postal system was in the establishment of our country. Since that time, it has been as American as apple pie, motherhood, baseball, you name it. Over 90% of the American people support the postal system. There isn’t any agency of government that can make that claim. It is a service, postal service. So, when people say, “Well, it doesn’t pay its own way.” It’s not a business, it’s a service. And while we always want to subject every federal dollar to the scrutiny of what we’re getting for it, let us remember that it is a service. No business that I can think of would ever be saddled with what we’ve done to the postal service saying that in 2006, a bill passed that said that the postal service should pay 75 years of its health benefits in 10 years. 75 years of its health benefits in 10 years. That is a responsibility that I don’t think most businesses could meet and also come out on top.
Earlier this year, Mr. DeFazio put forth a bill to limit what that is. So, when they say it doesn’t pay us, well, we had to do these cuts, and those cuts, and those cuts, we’re cutting service. We’re cutting service, not we, but the new postmaster general. We have called our members back for legislation that allocates the resources, $25 billion, that were recommended by the US postal service, the board of governors of the postal service. They are a board that are bipartisan and 100% appointed by President Donald Trump, and they recommended the $25 billion. Actually, they recommended more, which we will have in other bills. That’s part of this legislation.
It is also necessary for us to this legislation because in my conversations with the postmaster general, which were most unsatisfactory, he said he had no intention of restoring the post office boxes that were removed, no intention of restoring the sorting machinery in the postal services and other infrastructure very essential to keeping the mail on time. And when I suggested that we have the ballots in the election treated as first class mail, he said he had no intention of doing that. But if it was in the bill, then, he would. And yesterday, you see that he’s now saying that he will. But to make sure that that happens because his comments are one thing. His actions will be another.
That’s why we have this legislation. We’ll be talking about it on the floor. Our distinguished chair, Carolyn Maloney chair of the Committee of Jurisdiction will be making her presentation as soon as the vote is over, shortly, at one o’clock, and will have more to say. But I think it’s very useful to people to take the pride that it does. Letters to Santa, messages from the tooth fairy, families communicating. I know people are doing some things on social media and that’s good, but as a grandmother, I can tell you there’s nothing, no substitute that a drawing or a note from your grandchild through the mail. But more important than that, as important as that is to our culture, our health. 1.2 billion prescriptions sent through the mail in 2019. 80%, 90%, depending on the figures, and we’re trying to verify them, but at least 80% of the prescription sent from the VA to our veterans through the mail.
So, when the mail slows down, the medication slows down. The health of our veterans are affected, and that’s who we are hearing from. The mail slowing down. And that’s what we have to address today. And again, we’ll go over all of the provisions of the bill about stopping the slowing down of the mail. But this was an intention. Now, the postmaster general is saying, “We’re going to not do any of this until after the election.” Our legislation is not just about the election. It’s about surprise, surprise, Mr. postmaster general, the coronavirus. COVID-19, which has a big impact on the election as well as, first and foremost, on the health of the American people. So, this isn’t just about until after the election, if that can be trusted. It’s about the length, as we say, in the bill, the end of January or the end of coronavirus, which other takes longer. And so, this is why this legislation is necessary too because even in his statements, which are ambiguous, they don’t go far enough.
I’m excited about the history of it. In the early 1770s, building on the work of Benjamin Franklin, who oversaw the precursor of the postal service from 1753 to 1774, the revolutionaries established underground networks, the committees of correspondence, and then, the constitutional post that enabled them to communicate without the knowledge of the British. It goes on to say the earliest committee was formed in 1764 in Boston. It goes on. Our first postmaster general was Benjamin Franklin. The exchanges that followed what I just described built solidarity during the turbulent times and helped bring about the formation of the first Continental Congress. In any event, when Alexis de Tocqueville spoke in that century, he said… Alexis de Tocqueville would praise the postal service, writing that, “Not in the most enlightened rural districts of France is there an intellectual movement so rapid or on such a scale as in this wilderness. The effectiveness from the start.”
And so, that, as I say, rooted in American history, part of the communication that established us from going from colonies to a country there for America’s families to communicate businesses to thrive, medicines to be delivered now at this case, a time of an election, at the time of a pandemic, of a safe way for people to vote, it’s very important to shine a bright light on the postal system and to show our appreciation for what is done of nearly 100,000, 97,000, I think the number is. That 97,000 veterans are employed by the postal service. So, this, for us, is as a joyous occasion to come together, to vote for the postal service, and to meet the needs of our people, our constituents. You can ask any member of Congress across the country, Democratic or Republican, if they’re hearing from their constituents on this subject, and they are.
As we go forward then, just to note that tomorrow will be 100 days, today, 99 days since we passed the HEROES Act. It is very urgent, even more than when we passed it, for us to have the values that… This isn’t a discussion about just dollars. It’s about values and how we value the health and wellbeing of the American people. How we honor and value the work of our heroes, our healthcare workers, our first responders, our teachers, our teachers, our transportation, sanitation, food workers, all many employed by the state and local government. And a big obstacle to our going forward is the attitude of the Republicans. Let the states go bankrupt, and not fully coming to the table to support that. And of course, right now, as a grandmother and a mom of grandchildren in school and children who teach, we really have to make it safe for our children to go to school, and that takes money.
It takes money for distancing, more teachers, bigger classrooms, or more classrooms, ventilation, and the rest. Out of a hundred biggest school systems, school districts in the country, over 75 of them are either 62, all virtual, another dozen or so, hybrid. A small number, actual. And our fight with the administration has been that they want the bulk of the money to go only if you actually open up, which is a small percentage of the biggest school districts in our country. And who pays mostly for schools, but state and local government. But more important than that, even, is the firing. The firings that will occur could be in the millions. Already, it’s a million and a half. Could be three and a half million more people fired. And what does that do but add to the unemployment ranks? And what does that do but hurt our economy?
In any event, this, today, is one piece of what we have in the HEROES Act. I’m not for splitting it up, except this is an emergency. And it has policy in it that was not in the HEROES Act. So, I’m very proud of our members for coming back for this. On the course of the day, I’ll be meeting with them, and we’ll be talking about the justifications by what measure, what justification, scientific, institutionally, et cetera, are we saying we need so much more money for education than the administration is ready to give. By what scientific basis are we justifying the funding that we want for testing, tracing, treatment, distancing, et cetera. By what justification are we saying we need over $50 billion for childcare.
We’re telling people that they have to go to work. They can’t because they have a child who’s not going to school. So, childcare is an answer in some of those cases. So, the list goes on, and we have put the justification for it. I will do so more intensely as we negotiate an agreement that we must have for the American people. Again, I’m sad about the state of California, but anytime a natural disaster hits, it’s so sad. And Iowa is suffering so badly in all of this. I hope that as soon as we can be, the federal government will be there to support what our members of Congress there have been asking for. Any questions? Yes, ma’am.
Well, you have a three-prong question, there.
First, let me say, we will pass the bill, and it will be in a bipartisan way today. And then, we will send it to the Senate, and let me just say that, as I’ve always said, public sentiment is everything. They’ll be hearing from their constituents because this hits home. Not receiving your mail on a timely fashion hits home. Not receiving your prescriptions, actually for our veterans, hits home in a way that is harmful to our country as well. Secondly, we’re hoping that the need for us to go forward in terms of we can open our economy if we have our testing. We can open our schools more safely if we have the point of care testing, tracing, treatment, et cetera. Why they will not follow science is beyond me. But nonetheless, we have to make that case, and it’s safer.
As I said, it was 99 days since we passed our bill. In that time of how many more people, it was 4.2 million more people have become infected. 4.2 million since we passed our bill. 88,000 more people have died, taking us past 175,000 people. You see the statements that are being made, that if we wear mask, if 95%, instead of 55% of people wore masks, the lives that could be saved going forward. Well, why don’t we also learn from what has happened in the past? When they said we’re going to press the pause button, they forgot to tell the virus they were pressing the pause button. It didn’t pause. So, we have to, we must absolutely have an agreement as we go forward that helps state and local government do their job to fight the coronavirus, to educate our children, to do so in a way that is safe, and, again, honors our heroes. Pass something that is sufficient in terms of crushing the virus. Instead, they’re crushing the affordable care act in court and the preexisting condition.
So, this is not just about dollars and cents. It’s about values and common sense. And then, to the last point in terms of voting is that… Look, don’t pay any attention to what the president is saying because it is all designed to suppress the vote. He’s going to have law enforcement… That’s in their playbook. We’ve seen their playbook. It’s in their playbook that they’ll have people intimidated to vote by having ICE agents or other law enforcement there to instill fear in people as they show up. Why are they here? It’s scary. But ignore that. It’s a suppress-the-vote tactic as is the suppressing of the ability of the postal system to deliver on its responsibility, to treat ballots as first class mail, and to deliver in a timely fashion, and not, and not ignore the need for overtime, not ignore the fact that so many members of postal service have contracted coronavirus. They’ll need for temporary employees to fill that in, and not ignore…
He said very blatantly, “I have no intention of replacing those mailboxes. I have no intention of replacing the machinery and the sorting machinery.” And that, by the way, is an OSHA issue in terms of sortment and the machinery to help do it. All I would say to the final part of your question is, ignore them, make a plan to vote, do so, to vote early so that we will have an outcome that is clear as close to election night as possible. I say that because the more that vote by mail, there may be some counting after the election, but I hope that our victory will be so big. It’ll be so big that it’ll be so clear. And by the way, from the standpoint of the House, it is my political goal to win so big that we are putting down the down payment of winning for two years from now.
Now, when you get into voting and voting by mail, once again, Mr. president, you come into my wheelhouse. I was chair of the party for a long time. Northern chair and state party chair in California. Had the experience of recognizing how important time is. It’s about time. It’s about the time it takes to get the mail to the people to vote, to get it to the post office, to make sure it’s there in a timely fashion. It’s about the time it takes to print some of the materials, both the ballots, as well as the persuasion material. So, I’ve been known to be there with my friends and volunteers, sitting there all night next to a printing machine to make sure somebody else didn’t come in ahead of us with their mailer, so that we could be on time for the post office.
This is exciting for our country. It’s how we communicate. It’s how we vote. It’s how we protect the health and wellbeing of the American people, and what they’re doing both in the postal service until they got caught, and what the president is saying, and now, his move about putting law enforcement, extra law enforcement people at the polls. Why would he do that except to scare people off? Why pay attention to that? Just honor the vision of our founders, that this is a democracy, and everybody’s going to have the chance to vote, and have their vote counted as cast. Another question? Yes, ma’am. I have another subject I want to bring up, so let’s move on.
Who is?
Oh, Meadows, okay. Thank you.
Well, let me just say, you listed some things that what’s-his-name put forth. He didn’t say anything about schools. He didn’t say anything about crushing the virus. He didn’t say anything about people who are being evicted. He didn’t say anything about food insecurity among millions of America’s children. He didn’t say anything about state and local. That’s completely unacceptable. On the other hand, what my colleagues… My colleagues, I welcome their suggestions, and that we’re all in sync. We said we would come down a trillion dollars. We’re ready to negotiate at that level. And again, we’re making some plans for some things that we want to do next because it’s what, how many days until the election? 73 or something? 73 day. 99 days since the bill, 73 days since the election, and we’re getting ready for this legislative session that comes and the legislative session that begins in January.
So, we’re in sync in our caucus, and his list is very deficient when it comes to our children, their childcare, their food, their housing, their education, their health, in terms of the virus. And know, just again, state and local does do over 90% of the education. I want to bring up another subject that the president brought up this morning, which is very scary, and everybody should take note of it. The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, has a responsibility to approve drugs, judging on their safety and their efficacy, not by a declaration from the White House about speed and politicizing the FDA. This was a very dangerous statement on the part of the president. Even for him, it went beyond the pale in terms of how he would jeopardize the health and wellbeing of the American people and accuse FDA of politics when he is the one who has tried to inject himself in the scientific decisions of the Food and Drug Administration. One more question, and I have to go to the floor. Yes, ma’am?
Well, let me also say Abraham Lincoln was a postmaster. He was as well. I think Harry Truman worked for the postal service. I don’t know exactly what his title was. This postal service has a great identification with leaders in our country. I wouldn’t use the word “compare,” I would use the word “contrast.” Benjamin Franklin understood the value of bringing people together in our country. He did not view it as a business enterprise. He believed in it as a service, postal service. And that is what we have to support. To bring it in and say, “Well, they’re losing money in this or that,” really? Really? Are we losing money on delivering prescription drugs to our veterans? Are we losing money in how we have people communicate with each other and our families, and create jobs, good paying jobs? 97,000 veterans who are employed by the postal service.
I think the biggest contrast would be, one sees it as a service for the American people. The other sees it as a business enterprise, and doesn’t value its purpose, and doesn’t value its purpose. But hopefully, he will see the light as he sees the legislation. And if the Republicans in the Senate refuse to take it up, they’re just going to have to answer to their own constituents, why they don’t want their mail delivered in a timely fashion. What is it? Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow, or dark of night, we’ll keep the courier from his or her, now, appointed arounds. That doesn’t seem to be the purpose of the current of leadership of the postal service. Thank you all. See you on the floor.

Les Huckfield,United Kingdom,2020-03-21,"I am grateful to my hon. That is because the proposal to close Speke No. 2 assembly plant has some wide-ranging implications for British Leyland and for Merseyside. As my hon. Friend has ​ said, I am sure that on both sides of the House we all wish that the British Leyland management did not need to take difficult decisions of this sort.
That need is dictated primarily by the state of British Leyland, which, as the chairman of the company, Mr. Michael Edwardes, made clear in his speech to employees on 1st February, is critical. The company has made no secret of the fact that its performance has been unsatisfactory. That is reflected in the fall in British Leyland’s market share from 33 per cent. to less than 25 per cent. last year, and to 21 per cent. in January.
I am glad to note that provisional indications are that British Leyland’s market share for February has shown some signs of improvement. Nevertheless, one thing is clear: the company needs a period of sustained production accompanied by a major effort to reduce costs so that British Leyland can compete with other European manufacturers both at home and in export markets. This means adjusting capacity and manpower in line with realistic market prospects, taking account of the impossibility of recovering market share overnight and of the fact that British Leyland still has power and manpower levels geared to production on the pre-Ryder scale.
If the company fails to adjust capacity now and its market share continues to decline, the result will be that many more jobs will be lost than those affected by the closure of Speke 2. The collapse of the company would have unthinkable consequences for employment in this country. Not only is British Leyland dirt country’s seventh largest employer; thousands of wage earners in supplier industries are dependent on the survival of the company. As Michael Edwardes has made clear, without realistic measures to improve production and reduce costs, that survival must be in doubt.
This is the task facing the management at British Leyland. It is the management which, in consultation with the National Enterprise Board, must decide on the specific measures necessary to restore the company’s fortunes. The Government have accepted the view of the British Leyland Board and the National Enterprise Board that British Leyland’s capacity, including manpower, must be brought into line with market prospects, but the ​ Government cannot set themselves up as an alternative manager of the company, so that means to achieve this must be left for British Leyland management to decide in consultation with the National Enterprise Board.
As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in the House on 31st January, the Government have full confidence in the new management at British Leyland and are committed to supporting Michael Edwardes in his attempt to improve the company’s performance. A start has been made. As hon Members may know, steps have been taken to restructure the company, and at the meeting at Kenilworth on 1st February Michael Edwardes secured the backing of employees for his proposals. At the same time the British Leyland board has submitted to the National Enterprise Board its corporate plan for 1978 outlining its proposals for a future strategy for the company.
It would, however, be difficult for the Government to justify both to this House and to the public at large further investment in British Leyland, especially on the scale that British Leyland is likely to need, unless the management can clearly demonstrate that firm steps are being taken to tackle the company’s problems. Those steps may be unpleasant and, in the case of the proposal to close Speke 2, they have been made all the more difficult to take by the fact that the plant is located on Merseyside.
I fully understand what my hon. Friend said about the situation on Merseyside. It was because of our concern for Merseyside that we designated it a special development area in August 1974. This means that Merseyside gets regional development grants, Government factories, regional selective assistance, removal grants and grants to encourage the movement of offices and other service industries. In fact, Merseyside is among those places which are given the highest priority in the steering of new investment.
The role of the NEB has been strengthened following the establishment of an NEB regional board for the North-West. We have commissioned a firm of consultants to identify the types of business most likely to prosper close to the port of Liverpool. The Liverpool partnership area, which Speke immediately adjoins, will benefit from increased resources under the Department of the Environment’s urban programme, and the greater powers to assist industry given to them under the Inner Urban Areas Bill. I could give my hon. Friend more details about my Department’s small firms information centre in Liverpool and about assistance under Section 8 of the Industry Act.
Under the Hardman decisions on the dispersal of Government work from London, Merseyside probably comes out as one of the best areas. The bulk of the 4,000 dispersals to the North-West, nearly 3,000 posts, will go to Merseyside. The Hardman dispersals will inevitably take some time to carry out, but I am sure that hon. Members will welcome these additional office jobs and appreciate that this shows recognition of the serious problem.
There are achievements on the plus side. I shall name but a few. Vauxhall has recruited 2,000 workers at Ellesmere Port. The Co-operative Bank will provide 600 new jobs at hard-hit Skelmersdale. Cross International has announced a £2½ million investment programme with 200 jobs to come over four years at Knowsley. YKK is recruiting at Run- ​ corn. Tate &amp; Lyle is investing heavily. Shell Chemicals has planning permission for a £50 million plant at Stanlow.
These are a few of the projects in Merseyside.
In co-operation with the Manpower Services Commission, the Government have introduced a wide range of special schemes designed specifically to alleviate increased unemployment. They include the job creation and work experience programmes, the youth employment subsidy, the job release scheme, the temporary employment subsidy and the small firms employment subsidy.
It is estimated that over 41,000 persons, many of them young people, have been assisted by these measures in Merseyside. The temporary employment subsidy has been of particular benefit—with applications approved in respect of over 16,000 workers in the area.
It is difficult to satisfy my hon. Friend in a debate such as this. I fully appreciate the statement that he has made on behalf of his constituents. I and the Department understand the problems of Merseyside.
There are plans for a new 100-place skillcentre to be established in the Wirral and for a smaller 60-place centre for adults and young people in Liverpool itself. Both of these should be in operation by 1980–1981.
It is, as I have already made clear, for British Leyland management to take the difficult decisions necessary for the company’s survival and, in this particular case, to decide whether to proceed with the closure after.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-04-21,"Good.
No, just -- you know, I asked the government to let her out...
You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.
Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. It's an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize -- I mean, she was in a rough place.
No. No deal. He was here. He -- I said, ""I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out."" And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people...
. [Crosstalk
Chancellor Merkel.
And I guess somebody shouted out, ""Shake her hand, shake her hand,"" you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.
No. Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi...
So it was a great thing to see that happen.
I think the 100 days is, you know, it's an artificial barrier. It's not very meaningful. I think I've established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I'm here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I've established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they've never seen anything like what's going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together...
I've developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody's written that. In fact, they said, ""Oh, well, he's not treating them nicely,"" because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, ""Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up."" He'll pay.
He's going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it's a different kind of a presidency.
Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, ""I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,"" or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth...
I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, ""I've never seen anything like this in my life."" We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut -- same planes, same everything -- was because of me. I mean, because that's what I do.
Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, ""Could I thank you?"" I said, ""What?"" He said, ""You saved us $100 million."" Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they bought. Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of -- it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.
More. I'm gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know?
I have great relationships with Congress. I think we're doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it's -- we've worked on it long and hard. And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 day, so I've been working on health care for 60 days...You know, we're very close. And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.
So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They're great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don't have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it's fine. But you know there's a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we'll be in great shape on that. It's going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent.
Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But we've done a lot. You have a list of things. I don't have to read it.
Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ...
But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, ""By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem,"" doesn't work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing. It's not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything?
But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, ""By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you're a currency manipulator."" It doesn't work that way.
And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, ""He didn't call them a currency manipulator."" Well, for two reasons. Number One, he's not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it's like generalities, it's not. They have -- they've actually -- their currency's gone up. So it's a very, very specific formula. And I said, ""How badly have they been,""... they said, ""Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency."" That's Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't. Can you imagine? ...
No, because much of the foundation's been laid. Things came up. I'll give you an example. I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 day plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.
I don't know...
That's the biggest thing I've done.
Well, I -- first of all I think he's a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years.... He's a young man. I've always heard that that's the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I've done one in my first 70 days.
Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up...
I'm rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million -- look at that, that's a massive amount of money. And I'll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes -- Gen... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, ""I've never seen anything like this before, as long as I've been in the military."" You know, that kind of cutting.
... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won't happen.
Well the one thing I would say -- and I say this to people -- I never realized how big it was. I was talking to --
Number One, there's great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I'm saying to myself, ""You know, this is more than just like, 79 missiles. This is death that's involved,"" because people could have been killed. This is risk that's involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area -- you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away -- and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you'd normally make... This is involving death and life and so many things.... So it's far more responsibility....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest -- you know, you go down the list.
It's massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life that's involved in some of the decisions.
Well in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you're talking about health care -- you have health care in business but you're trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You're providing health. Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don't involve heart.
In fact, in business you're actually better off without it.
You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. I mean we're going to be doing major tax reform. Everybody's saying, ""Oh, he's delaying."" I'm not delaying anything. I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That's another thing that really has -- I've never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, ""Well the one thing good is now I'll get good press."" And it got worse. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.
Well I'm going to roll probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we're putting out a massive tax reform -- business and for people -- we want to do both. Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart.... We're going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter.... And that's a big story, because a lot of people think I'm going to put it out much later.
Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had...
I don't know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it -- you've been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it's funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down.... That's a tremendous achievement.... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower. Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that.
Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I'm seeing. I'm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.
Oh I'm seeing numbers -- $24 billion, I think I'll do it for $10 billion or less. That's not a lot of money relative to what we're talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in -- and we'll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall -- they're coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can't do it because it's a real wall. That's a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We're becoming a drug culture, there's so much. And most of it's coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs.
I don't want to comment. I just don't know yet. I mean, I have to see what's going on. I really do. But the wall's a very important thing to -- not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn't, I mean I'll do things that aren't necessarily popular.... The wall is very important to stopping drugs.
My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall's getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it's getting built. And it's also getting built for much less money -- I hope you get this -- than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It's not going to cost anywhere near that.
I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it's not going to be anywhere near those kind of numbers. And they're using those numbers; they're using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable. And the fact it's going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.
They had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete. But they didn't say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government. People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO's obsolete -- not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO -- NATO is obsolete, and I said, ""And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism."" You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.
... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete -- I said two things -- obsolete, and the country's aren't paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn't believe. And then some expert on NATO said, ""You know, Trump is right."" But I said it was obsolete because they weren't focused on terror...
It's not fair that we're paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they're supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.""
Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.
I think so.
No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it'll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what's been going on in France.
No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing...
No, I am no different than -- no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we've done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I'm not going to have it in this country. I'm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it's already largely, you know -- we have tens -- we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn't be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. It's a big mistake.
I am not endorsing her and I didn't mention her name.
I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place.
You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand.... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma, he comes up, he says, ""Only because of you am I making this massive investment."" Intel, only because of you.... The press never writes that.
What would you like to know?
I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don't even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.
I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.
Absolutely. If they don't treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.
It's a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it's a six-month clause.
When Wikileaks came out... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, ""Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff."" You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren't able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, ""Wow."" It was just a figure of speech. I said, ""Well, look at this. It's good reading.""
No, I don't support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn't have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn't even allow the FBI. How about this -- they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won't let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.
That's what I heard. I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It's incredible.
I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it's OK with me. I didn't know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it's OK with me.
And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers...
In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.
No, I don't say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.
In terms of what they are doing of all over.
I don't talk to them about it.
I mention it, but it's very personal when I talk to them, you know, it's confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don't say that they are different than my opinions, but I'd rather have you ask them that question.
It's possible that we won't.
No, we aren't looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he's got some problems, it's a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They've taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that's what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.
Yes. Yes. That's our policy. I am not saying... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. Kelly, now Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being... all over the country and nobody's ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that's probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth...
Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I'll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy...
A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.
I did. I did. I believed in it and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success?... That's another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we've had in the Middle East with the ISIS.... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it. We don't talk about it.
I don't talk about it. No. And the generals don't talk about it.
We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.
Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.
Right. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.
Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations.
No, not much.
Well, they've also accepted my strategy.
Not many.
It could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more.... This is an important story. I've done a lot. I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I'm scheduled... the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean ...
We had good chemistry. Now I don't know that I think that's going to produce results but you've got a good chance.
Look, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They're coming into China and they're being turned away. That's never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they've never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There's a great foundation that's built. Great foundation. And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country.
That's fine.
Yes. I think my team has been, well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect. As they should be. I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.
Yeah, my White House team. I think Reince has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California. It's just the registration, there's nothing you can do. So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard. Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were... but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York, you lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.
So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions... Yeah. Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because you know it wasn't 270, it was 306. So there's anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here's a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes.
Three Democratic votes. OK. He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all... nothing. He's like a ...
Yeah, I do.
I think I can to an extent. But there's a, there's a basic hard-line core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through. There's a hard-line group you can't break through, you can't. It's sad. You can't. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings. I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.
That's what he said. I mean, what can I tell you?
There's six people sitting here. What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?
Well he said, you'll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I'll take that also, but that you could be. But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here. It's incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later and it's like he was never in my office. And you can even say that.
No I have, it's interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it's the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.
It had 9.2 million people. It's the highest they've ever had.2 million people. It's the highest for ""Face the Nation"" or as I call it, ""Deface the Nation."" It's the highest for ""Deface the Nation"" since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It's a tremendous advantage.
I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no. The fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you're fake, but -- but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It's not that Fox treats me well, it's that Fox is the most accurate.
I do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it's a terrorism... it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, ""He called it a terrorist attack."" They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I'm 10-0 for that. I've called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I'm... Whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I'm here and they're not.
Yeah.
The one thing --
OK. The one thing I've learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don't watch CNN anymore.
Where? Where?
No, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I, what'd I say, I stopped watching them. But I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC. I don't watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what's going on.
In fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch ""Morning Joe."" I don't watch ""Morning Joe."" I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it's about me. Or pleasant. But when I see it's such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I've developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don't watch things that are unpleasant. I just don't watch them.
I don't know why it is, but I've developed that ability, and it's happened over the last, over the last year.
And I don't watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don't watch them anymore. A lot of people don't watch them anymore, they're now in third place. But I've created something where people are watching... but I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC anymore. I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I'd watch.
I just don't. And that's taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that's a great, it's a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you're, you don't watch this total negativity. I never thought I'd be able to do that and for me, it's so easy to do now. Just don't watch.
Maybe it's because I'm here. I don't know.
",Interview: Donald Trump With Julie Pace of The Associated Press,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-ap-april-21-2017
George Bush,United States of America,1992-08-20 00:00:00,"Thank you all very much. Thank you, thank you very much. And I am proud to receive and I am honored to accept your nomination for President of the United States. May I thank my dear friend and our great leader, Bob Dole, for that wonderful introduction. Let me say this: This nomination's not for me alone. It is for the ideas, principles, and values that we stand for. My job has been made easier by a leader who's taken a lot of unfair criticism with grace and humor, the Vice President of the United States, Dan Quayle. And I am very grateful to him. I want to talk tonight about the sharp choice that I intend to offer Americans this fall, a choice between different agendas, different directions, and yes, a choice about the character of the man you want to lead this Nation. I know that Americans have many questions about our economy, about our country's future, even questions about me. I'll answer them tonight. First, I feel great. And I am heartened by the polls, the ones that say that I look better in my jogging shorts than the Governor of Arkansas. Four years ago, I spoke about missions for my life and for our country. I spoke of one urgent mission, defending our security and promoting the American ideal abroad. Just pause for a moment to reflect on what we've done. Germany is united, and a slab of the Berlin Wall sits right outside this Astrodome. Arabs and Israelis now sit face to face and talk peace, and every hostage held in Lebanon is free. The conflict in El Salvador is over, and free elections brought democracy to Nicaragua. Black and white South Africans cheered each other at the Olympics. The Soviet Union can only be found in history books. The captive nations of Eastern Europe and the Baltics are captive no more. And today on the rural streets of Poland, merchants sell cans of air labeled ``the last breath of communism.''If I had stood before you 4 years ago and described this as the world we would help to build, you would have said, ``George Bush, you must have been smoking something, and you must have inhaled.''This convention is the first at which an American President can say the cold war is over, and freedom finished first. Audience members. U. S.A.! U. S.A.! U. S.A.!The President. We have a lot to be proud of, a lot. Some want to rewrite history, want to skip over the struggle, claim the outcome was inevitable. And while the U. S. postwar strategy was largely bipartisan, the fact remains that the liberal McGovern wing of the other party, including my opponent, consistently made the wrong choices. In the seventies, they wanted a hollow army. We wanted a strong fighting force. In the eighties -- and you remember this one -- in the eighties, they wanted a nuclear freeze, and we insisted on peace through strength. From Angola to Central America, they said, ``Let's negotiate, deliberate, procrastinate.'' We said, ``Just stand up for freedom.'' Now the cold war is over, and they claim, ``Hey, we were with you all the way.''Audience members. Boo-o-o!The President. You know, their behavior reminds me of the old con man's advice to the new kid. He said, ``Son, if you're being run out of town, just get out in front and make it look like a parade.''Well, make no mistake: The demise of communism wasn't a sure thing. It took the strong leadership of Presidents from both parties, including Republicans like Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. Without their vision and the support of the American people, the Soviet Union would be a strong superpower today, and we'd be facing a nuclear threat tonight. My opponents say I spend too much time on foreign policy, as if it didn't matter that schoolchildren once hid under their desks in drills to prepare for nuclear war. I saw the chance to rid our children's dreams of the nuclear nightmare, and I did. Over the past 4 years, more people have breathed the fresh air of freedom than in all of human history. I saw a chance to help, and I did. These were the two defining opportunities not of a year, not of a decade, but of an entire span of human history. I seized those opportunities for our kids and our grandkids, and I make no apologies for that. Now, the Soviet bear may be gone, but there are still wolves in the woods. We saw that when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The Mideast might have become a nuclear powder keg, our energy supplies held hostage. So we did what was right and what was necessary. We destroyed a threat, freed a people, and locked a tyrant in the prison of his own country. What about the leader of the Arkansas National Guard, the man who hopes to be Commander in Chief? Well, I bit the bullet, and he bit his nails. Listen to this now. Two days after Congress followed my lead, my opponent said this, and I quote directly: ``I guess I would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote. But I agree with the arguments the minority made.'' Now, sounds to me like his policy can be summed up by a road sign he's probably seen on his bus tour, ``Slippery When Wet.''Look, this is serious business. Think about the impact of our foreign policy failures the last time the Democrats controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue: gas lines, grain embargoes, American hostages blindfolded. There will be more foreign policy challenges like Kuwait in the next 4 years, terrorists and aggressors to stand up to, dangerous weapons to be controlled and destroyed. Freedom's fight is not finished. I look forward to being the first President to visit a free, democratic Cuba. Who will lead the world in the face of these challenges? Not my opponent. In his acceptance speech he devoted just 65 seconds to telling us about the world. Then he said that America was, and I quote again -- I want to be fair and factual -- I quote, being ``ridiculed'' everywhere. Well, tell that to the people around the world, for whom America is still a dream. Tell that to leaders around the world, from whom America commands respect. Ridiculed? Tell that to the men and women of Desert Storm. Audience members. U. S.A.! U. S.A.! U. S.A.!The President. Let me just make an aside comment here because of what you've been reading in the paper. This is a political year, but there's a lot of danger in the world. You can be sure I will never let politics interfere with a foreign policy decision. Forget the election; I will do right, what is right for the national security of the United States of America, and that is a pledge from my heart. Fifty years ago this summer, I was 18 years of age. I see some young people in the audience tonight, and I remember how I felt in those days. I believed deeply in this country, and we were faced with a world war. So I made a decision to go off and fight a battle much different from political battles. I was scared, but I was willing. I was young, but I was ready. I had barely lived when I began to watch men die. I began to see the special place of America in the world. I began to see, even then, that the world would become a much smaller place, and faraway places could become more and more like America. Fifty years later, after change of almost Biblical proportions, we know that when freedom grows, America grows. Just as a strong America means a safer world, we have learned that a safer world means a stronger America. This election is about change. But that's not unusual, because the American revolution is never ending. Today, the pace of change is accelerating. We face new opportunities and new challenges. The question is: Who do you trust to make change work for you?Audience members. George Bush! George Bush! George Bush!The President. My opponent says America is a nation in decline. Of our economy, he says we are somewhere on the list beneath Germany, heading south toward Sri Lanka. Well, don't let anyone tell you that America is second-rate, especially somebody running for President. Maybe he hasn't heard that we are still the world's largest economy. No other nation sells more outside its borders. The Germans, the British, the Japanese can't touch the productivity of you, the American worker and the American farmer. My opponent won't mention that. He won't remind you that interest rates are the lowest they've been in 20 years, and millions of Americans have refinanced their homes. You just won't hear that inflation, the thief of the middle class, has been locked in a maximum security prison. You don't hear much about this good news because the media also tends to focus only on the bad. When the Berlin Wall fell, I half expected to see a headline, ``Wall Falls, Three Border Guards Lose Jobs.''  And underneath, it probably says, ``Clinton Blames Bush.'' You don't hear a lot about progress in America. So let me tell you about some good things we've done together. Just two weeks ago, all three nations of North America agreed to trade freely from Manitoba to Mexico. This will bring good jobs to Main Street, U. S.A. We passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, bringing 43 million people into the economic mainstream. I must say, it's about time. Our children will breathe easier because of our new clean air pact. We are rebuilding our roads, providing jobs for more than half a million Americans. We passed a child care law, and we took a stand for family values by saying that when it comes to raising children, Government doesn't know best; parents know best. I have fought against prejudice and anti-Semitism all my life. I am proud that we strengthened our civil rights laws, and we did it without resorting to quotas. One more thing of vital importance to all: Today, cocaine use has fallen by 60 percent among young people. To the teenagers, the parents, and the volunteers who are helping us battle the scourge of drugs in America, we say, thank you; thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Do I want to do more? You bet. Nothing hurts me more than to meet with soldiers home from the Persian Gulf who can't find a job or workers who have a job but worry that the next day will bring a pink slip. And what about parents who scrape and struggle to send their kids to college, only to find them back living at home because they can't get work. The world is in transition, and we are feeling that transition in our homes. The defining challenge of the nineties is to win the economic competition, to win the peace. We must be a military superpower, an economic superpower, and an export superpower. In this election, you'll hear two versions of how to do this. Theirs is to look inward and protect what we already have. Ours is to look forward, to open new markets, prepare our people to compete, to restore our social fabric, to save and invest so we can win. We believe that now that the world looks more like America, it's time for America to look more like herself. And so we offer a philosophy that puts faith in the individual, not the bureaucracy; a philosophy that empowers people to do their best, so America can be at its best. In a world that is safer and freer, this is how we will build an America that is stronger, safer, and more secure. We start with a simple fact: Government is too big and spends too much. I have asked Congress to put a lid on mandatory spending, except Social Security. I've proposed doing away with over 200 programs and 4,000 wasteful projects and to freeze all other spending. The gridlock Democrat Congress said no. Audience members. Boo - o - o!The President. So, beginning tonight, I will enforce the spending freeze on my own. If Congress sends me a bill spending more than I asked for in my budget, I will veto it fast, veto it fast, faster than copies of Millie's book sold. Now, Congress won't cut spending, but refuses to give the President the power to eliminate pork-barrel projects that waste your money. Forty-three Governors have that power. So I ask you, the American people: Give me a Congress that will give me the line-item veto. Let me tell you about a recent battle fought with the Congress, a battle in which I was aided by Bob Michel and his troops, and Bob Dole and his. This spring, I worked day and night to get two-thirds of the House Members to approve a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We almost had it, but we lost by just nine votes. Now, listen how. Just before the vote, the liberal leaders of the Congress convinced 12 Members who cosponsored the bill to switch sides and vote no. Keep in mind, they voted against a bill they had already put their names on. Something fishy is going on. And look at my opponent on this issue. Look at my opponent. He says he's for balanced budgets. But he came out against the amendment. He's like that on a lot of issues, first on one side, then the other. He's been spotted in more places than Elvis Presley. After all these years, Congress has become pretty creative at finding ways to waste your money. So we need to be just as creative at finding ways to stop them. I have a brandnew idea. Taxpayers should be given the right to check a box on their tax returns so that up to 10 percent of their payments can go for one purpose alone: to reduce the national debt. But we also need to make sure that Congress doesn't just turn around and borrow more money to spend more money. So I will require that for every tax dollar set aside to cut the debt, the ceilings on spending will be cut by an equal amount. That way, we will cut both debt and spending and take a whack out of the budget deficit. My feelings about big government come from my experience; I spent half my adult life in the private sector. My opponent has a different experience; he's been in government nearly all his life. His passion to expand government knows no bounds. He's already proposed, and listen to this carefully, he has already proposed $220 billion in new spending, along with the biggest tax increase in history, $150 billion. And that's just to start. Audience members. Boo-o-o!The President. He says he wants to tax the rich. But folks, he defines rich as anyone who has a job. You've heard of the separations of powers. Well, my opponent practices a different theory: the power of separations. Government has the power to separate you from your wallet. Now let me say this: When it comes to taxes, I've learned the hard way. There's an old saying, ``Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment.'' Two years ago, I made a bad call on the Democrats tax increase. I underestimated Congress' addiction to taxes. With my back against the wall, I agreed to a hard bargain: One tax increase one time in return for the toughest spending limits ever. Well, it was a mistake to go along with the Democratic tax increase, and I admit it. But here's the question for the American people. Who do you trust in this election? The candidate who's raised taxes one time and regrets it, or the other candidate who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed it every time?Audience members. Viva Bush! Viva Bush! Viva Bush!The President. Thank you very much. Audience members. Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again, harder, harder! Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again, harder, harder!The President. When the new Congress convenes next January, I will propose to further reduce taxes across the board, provided we pay for these cuts with specific spending reductions that I consider appropriate, so that we do not increase the deficit. I will also continue to fight to increase the personal exemption and to create jobs by winning a cut in capital gains taxes. That will especially help small businesses. You know, they create -- small businesses -- they create two-thirds of the new jobs in America. But my opponent's plan for small business is clear, present, and dangerous. Beside new income taxes, his plan will lead to a new payroll tax to pay for a Government takeover of health care and another new tax to pay for training. That is just the beginning. If he gets his way, hardware stores across America will have a new sign up, ``Closed for despair.'' I guess you'd say his plan really is ``Elvis economics.'' America will be checking into the ``Heartbreak Hotel.''I believe that small business needs relief from taxation, regulation, and litigation. And thus, I will extend for one year the freeze on paperwork and unnecessary Federal regulation that I imposed last winter. There is no reason that Federal regulations should live longer than my friend George Burns. I will issue an order to get rid of any rule whose time has come and gone. I see something happening in our towns and in our neighborhoods. Sharp lawyers are running wild. Doctors are afraid to practice medicine, and some moms and pops won't even coach Little League any more. We must sue each other less and care for each other more. I am fighting to reform our legal system, to put an end to crazy lawsuits. If that means climbing into the ring with the trial lawyers, well, let me just say, round one starts tonight. After all, my opponent's campaign is being backed by practically every trial lawyer who ever wore a tasselled loafer. He's not in the ring with them; he's in the tank. There are other things we need to do to get our economy up to speed, prepare our kids for the next century. We must have new incentives for research and new training for workers. Small businesses need capital and credit, and defense workers need new jobs. I have a plan to provide affordable health care for every American, controlling costs by cutting paperwork and lawsuits and expanding coverage to the poorest of the poor. We do not need my opponent's plan for a massive Government takeover of health care, which would ration care and deny you the right to choose a doctor. Who wants health care with a system with the efficiency of the House post office and the compassion of the KGB?What about our schools? What about our schools? My opponent and I both want to change the way our kids learn. He wants to change our schools a little bit, and I want to change them a lot. Take the issue of whether parents should be able to choose the best school for their kids. My opponent says that's okay, as long as the school is run by government. And I say every parent and child should have a real choice of schools, public, private, or religious. So we have a clear choice to fix our problems. Do we turn to the tattered blanket of bureaucracy that other nations are tossing away? Or do we give our people the freedom and incentives to build security for themselves?Here's what I'm fighting for: Open markets for American products; lower Government spending; tax relief; opportunities for small business; legal and health reform; job training; and new schools built on competition, ready for the 21st century. Now, okay, why are these proposals not in effect today? Only one reason: the gridlock Democratic Congress. Audience members. Clean your House! Clean your House! Clean your House!The President. A very good idea, a very good idea. Now, I know Americans are tired of the blame game, tired of people in Washington acting like they're candidates for the next episode of ``American Gladiators.'' I don't like it, either. Neither should you. But the truth is the truth. Our policies have not failed. They haven't even been tried. Americans want jobs, and on January 28th, I put before Congress a plan to create jobs. If it'd been passed back then, 500,000 more Americans would be at work right now. But in a Nation that demands action, Congress has become the master of inaction. It wasn't always this way. I heard President Ford tonight. I served in Congress 22 years ago, under him. And back then, we cooperated. We didn't get personal. We put the people above everything else. Heck, we didn't even own blow dryers back in those days. At my first Inauguration, I said that people didn't send us to bicker. I extended my hand, and I think the American people know this, I extended my hand to the congressional leaders, the Democratic leaders, and they bit it. The House leadership has not changed in 38 years. It is a body caught in a hopelessly tangled web of PAC's, perks, privileges, partnership, and paralysis. Every day, Congress puts politics ahead of principle and above progress. Now, let me give you just one example: February 20th, 1991. It was at the height of the Gulf war. On that very same day, I asked American pilots to risk their lives to fly missions over Baghdad. I also wanted to strengthen our economic security for the future. So that very same day, I introduced a new domestic energy strategy which would cut our dependence on foreign oil by 7 million barrels a day. How many days did it take to win the Gulf war? Forty-three. How many did it take Congress to pass a national energy strategy? Five hundred and thirty-two, and still counting. I have ridden stationary bikes that can move faster than the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, controlled by the Democrat leadership. Audience members. Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again, harder, harder! Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again, harder, harder!The President. Okay. All right. You wait. I'm fixing to. Where does my opponent stand with Congress? Well, up in New York at their convention, they kept the congressional leaders away from the podium, hid them away. They didn't want America to hear from the people who really make the decisions. They hid them for a very good reason, because the American people would recognize a dangerous combination: a rubber-check Congress and a rubber-stamp President. Governor Clinton and Congress know that you've caught on to their lingo. They know when they say ``spending,'' you say ``uh-oh.'' So now they have a new word, ``investment.'' They want to ``invest'' $220 billion more of your money, but I want you to keep it. Governor Clinton and Congress want to put through the largest tax increase in history, but I will not let that happen. Governor Clinton and Congress don't want kids to have the option of praying in school, but I do. Clinton and Congress don't want to close legal loopholes and keep criminals behind bars, but I will. Clinton and Congress will stock the judiciary with liberal judges who write laws they can't get approved by the voters. Governor Clinton even says that Mario Cuomo belongs on the Supreme Court.  Wait a minute, though. No, wait. Maybe not a bad idea. If you believe in judicial restraint, you probably ought to be happy. After all, the good Governor of New York can't make up his mind between chocolate and vanilla at Baskin Robbins. He's there, we won't have another court decision for 35 years, and maybe that's all right, too. Are my opponent and Congress really in cahoots? Look at one important question: Should we limit the terms of Congress?Audience members. Yes. The President. Governor Clinton says no. Congress says no. I say yes. We tried this -- look, we tried this once before, combining the Democratic Governor of a small southern State with a very liberal Vice President and a Democratic Congress. America does not need Carter II. We do not want to take America back to those days of malaise. But Americans want to know: Where's proof that we will have better days in Washington?I'll give you 150 reasons. That's how many Members of Congress are expected to leave Washington this year. Some are tainted by scandal; the voters have bounced them the way they bounced their own checks. But others are good Members, Republican and Democrat, and they agree with me. The place just doesn't work anymore. One hundred-fifty new Members, from both parties, will be coming to Washington this fall. Every one will have a fresh view of America's future. I pledge today to the American people, immediately after this election, I will meet with every one of these Members, before they get attacked by the PAC's, overwhelmed by their staffs, and cornered by some camera crew. I will lay out my case for change, change that matters, real change that makes a difference, change that is right for America. You see, there is a yearning in America, a feeling that maybe it's time to get back to our roots. Sure we must change, but some values are timeless. I believe in families that stick together, fathers who stick around. I happen to believe very deeply in the worth of each individual human being, born or unborn. I believe in teaching our kids the difference between what's wrong and what's right, teaching them respect for hard work and to love their neighbors. I believe that America will always have a special place in God's heart, as long as He has a special place in ours. Maybe that's why I've always believed that patriotism is not just another point of view. There are times in every young person's life when God introduces you to yourself. I remember such a time. It was back many years ago, when I stood watch at 4 a. m. up on the bridge of a submarine, the United States Finback, U. S.S. Finback. And I would stand there and look out on the blackness of the sky, broken only by the sparkling stars above. And I would think about friends I lost, a country I loved, and about a girl named Barbara. I remember those nights as clearly as any in my life. You know, you can see things from up there that other people don't see. You can see storm clouds rise and then disappear, the first hint of the sun over the horizon, and the first outline of the shore far away. Now, I know that Americans are uneasy today. There is anxious talk around our kitchen tables. But from where I stand, I see not America's sunset but a sunrise. The world changes for which we've sacrificed for a generation have finally come to pass, and with them a rare and unprecedented opportunity to pass the sweet cup of prosperity around our American table. Are we up to it? I know we are. As I travel our land, I meet veterans who once worked the turrets of a tank and can now master the keyboards of high-tech economy. I see teachers blessed with the incredible American capacity for innovation who are teaching our children a new way to learn for a new century. I meet parents, some working two jobs with hectic schedules, who still find new ways to teach old values to steady their kids in a turbulent world. I take heart from what is happening in America, not from those who profess a new passion for government but from those with an old and enduring faith in the human potential, those who understand that the genius of America is our capacity for rebirth and renewal. America is the land where the sun is always peeking over the horizon. Tonight I appeal to that unyielding, undying, undeniable American spirit. I ask you to consider, now that the entire world is moving our way, why would we want to go back their way? I ask not just for your support for my agenda but for your commitment to renew and rebuild our Nation by shaking up the one institution that has withstood change for over four decades. Join me in rolling away the roadblock at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, so that in the next 4 years, we will match our accomplishments outside by building a stronger, safer, more secure America inside. Forty-four years ago in another age of uncertainty a different President embarked on a similar mission. His name was Harry S Truman. As he stood before his party to accept their nomination, Harry Truman knew the freedom I know this evening, the freedom to talk about what's right for America, and let the chips fall where they may. Harry Truman said this: This is more than a political call to arms. Give me your help, not to win votes alone, but to win this new crusade and keep America safe and secure for its own people. Well, tonight I say to you: Join me in our new crusade, to reap the rewards of our global victory, to win the peace, so that we may make America safer and stronger for all our people. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.

James Purnell,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"I’d like to thank Cicero Consulting and Money Marketing for the opportunity to speak at today’s event.
The White Paper we published in May set out a series of major reforms to create a new pensions settlement for the future. I’ve spent much of the past few months talking to the public and to stakeholders – including some of you here today – to build a consensus around those reforms. The consultation period following the White Paper has now officially ended – but work on our reform proposals continues.
Over the next few months my officials and I will be developing further the detail of these reforms – and in particular, the detail of the new scheme of personal accounts. In the May White Paper we committed to a further technical consultation paper later this year on personal accounts. That is still the timetable to which we are operating, but we now intend the document to be a White Paper rather than a technical document.
This decision reflects the significance we are placing on this element of our reforms. The introduction of personal accounts will be a significant institutional change – one of the most important institutions created since World War II – and one which deserves to be widely assessed in policy as well as technical terms.
Personal accounts are designed to effect a widespread change in the savings culture of this country. I’d like to spend a few moments reminding ourselves why that change is so necessary – why it is that there is currently widespread undersaving, and how our reforms will tackle the problem.
On an individual level, the problem lies in the fact that significant groups in society – and particularly low to middle income earners – have low incentives to save. And there are three clear reasons why this is.
Firstly, because the market has not served this group effectively. The costs to market providers of serving these groups of people are high, which has traditionally made it difficult to serve them profitably. This means that charges are relatively high – and so the cost of saving in the product is too high for these individuals.
Secondly, because the complexity of the current state pension system means that people are not clear what they will get from the State in retirement. Over several decades, there has been a series of modifications, reforms and adjustments by various governments, with the result that very few people today understand how the pensions system all fits together. Against this background, it is very difficult for someone thinking about their retirement to assess what their income from the state will be, and make a judgement about how much they will want to save on top of that.
And thirdly, because many people, when faced with financial decisions that seem complex and difficult, have a tendency to disengage entirely, and do nothing. Even though most people realise that they need to save for retirement, inertia frequently means that they simply don’t get round to doing it.
These three individual factors combine to produce a stark collective problem: there are simply not enough people saving. We’ve estimated that there are around 7 million people today who are not saving enough for their retirement.
And that is where our reforms come in. The policies we set out in our White Paper will address undersaving – at an individual and a collective level.
Let’s take the three barriers I just described. Our reforms will address each one.
First, the lack of suitable savings products for low and moderate earners. Our new scheme of personal accounts will provide everybody in this group with a suitable savings vehicle – suitable because charges will be low. That’s something that we are absolutely clear about. We don’t buy the argument that the level of charging is a secondary concern. Neither did the Pensions Commission. They argued that low charges in personal accounts were essential in order to ensure that individuals would benefit from cost-efficient pension saving, and therefore to increase the incentives to save for precisely those groups where undersaving is most prevalent.
We have looked in detail at the significance of charges in personal accounts, and remain convinced of the importance of keeping charges low. Every 0.1 % reduction in the annual management charge we manage to make could increase a long-term personal account holder’s fund by around 2%. That’s a crucial difference to retirement income.
If we manage to reduce annual management charges to 0.5% the average employee in personal accounts would be just under £600 per year better off in retirement.
And the other crucial difference that our reforms will make, of course, is the presence of the employer contribution. This is, for all employees, the very clearest incentive to save. Every £1 contributed into a personal account will be matched by the employer contribution and by tax-relief from the state, so £2 will go into the fund. Over a working life, with investment growth and low charges, that contribution might almost double. So you could end up with nearly £4 in the fund for every £1 invested by the individual. That’s a pretty good return.
Let’s look at the second barrier – the complexity of the current system. Our reform of state provision– wider coverage, fairness for women and carers, and linking the basic State Pension to average earnings – plus additional measures such as the abolition of contracting out for DC schemes – will mean that the state system in the future will provide a solid and clear foundation for private saving. Planning for retirement, and the decision to save, will be straightforward when individuals can be clear about what the State will do, and what they must do for themselves.
And, finally, the third main barrier – the prevalence of inertia when it comes to savings decisions. Our reformed system will overcome this barrier through automatic enrolment. All employees will be automatically enrolled into either good quality employer-based provision, or a personal account, with the freedom to opt out if they choose.
There is wide consensus that automatic enrolment is the right approach to tackling the behavioural barriers to saving inherent in our current voluntary system. Evidence suggests that it is one of the most effective ways of combating people’s tendency not to act when faced with difficult financial decisions. In other words, it ensures that those employees who do not take an active decision to save will not lose out on the very real benefits offered by tax relief and employer contributions.
Our reforms will tackle the problems that currently mean that many individuals have low incentives to save. And in tackling these, they will tackle the collective problem of undersaving: in the reformed system, saving will increase dramatically. Up to 10 million people could be saving in a personal account.
There has been a counter-argument made that automatic enrolment into personal accounts will constitute mis-selling. The line of this argument is that people will be automatically enrolled, but that it will not be in everyone’s interests to save because of the presence of means testing. And it claims that incentives to save will therefore still not be clear enough because we won’t be able to say to everyone that they will be better off.
We are determined to build a consensus around the reforms we have set out. But that should not be a sloppy consensus – it should be based on the fact that people have examined our proposals thoroughly. And so we welcome scrutiny and debate. But in this case, we believe that the evidence simply does not support the argument being made.
The test criteria by which to judge whether saving was beneficial for an individual is whether they ended up with more money in retirement.
I’ve explained that personal accounts will give a good return on contributions paid into them. Our analysis shows that an average earner saving in a personal account from the age of 25 to State Pension age might get an increase in retirement income of nearly £50 a week. But some people argue that they won’t work if there is still means testing in the system.
The problem is that this misunderstands how Pension Credit works. By 2050, our reforms will mean that only around a third30% of pensioners will be entitled to Pension Credit. And 80% of these would be on Savings Credit.
Savings Credit exists to reward people who have made some provision for their own retirement. And this won’t change under these reforms. People on Savings Credit would clearly be better off for having saved: for every pound they put in to Personal Accounts, their employer and tax relief would also put in a pound.
Add investment growth to this, and an individual on Savings Credit would still be receiving over £2 back in retirement for every pound they’ve put in. And again, that’s a good return on their investment.
But what about Guarantee Credit? I know that people’s real worry is about 100% withdrawal rates, which only occur on the Guarantee Credit. But again, we need to be clear about where this might feature. Our reforms to the state system mean that, by 2050, someone would have had to work or care for less than 20 years in order to be on the Guarantee Credit only at retirement.
This will be a pretty rare occurrence – people who, out of a working life of 50 years, had spent less than 20 earning, or caring for a child, or a sick friend or relative. Our analysis indicates that only about 6% of pensioners by 2050 would fall into this category, and therefore have private income fully taken into account.
And, typically, most of these people would have worked for very few years in which they were paid enough to cross the earnings threshold for automatic enrolment. They would therefore by and large not have been automatically enrolled. And, if they had managed to build up a small pension pot then they could take it as a lump sum, and might therefore avoid 100% withdrawal rates.
So, we think the vast majority of people will be better off in retirement for staying in personal accounts. And we think the argument that claims we would be mis-selling on the individual level is therefore wrong.
It is important to remember that automatic enrolment does not remove choice or responsibility from the individual. It will still be up to the individual to decide whether they remain in a personal account. The test for us in this will be whether we can give simple generic advice to people about whether they should do so. And we think that will be possible.
Widespread undersaving is a big problem to tackle. But because we think that our policies will work to tackle barriers to saving at the individual level, this makes it possible to address the collective problem. The vast majority of people will be better off for having saved in personal accounts. We are therefore justified in automatically enrolling them, but leaving them the choice about whether to stay in.
Let’s also not forget that the issues surrounding the interaction between saving and income-related benefits exist in all systems. For example, the system proposed by the Pensions Policy Institute has a similar proportion of people on 100% withdrawal rates to that we’ve outlined. The only way that you could avoid that would be to have no safety net for the poorest pensioners – and I don’t believe that’s a responsible suggestion in terms of preventing pensioner poverty.
It’s worth remembering, too, that this is what Pension Credit was designed to do – to tackle poverty. It doesn’t take money away from people – it gives them more money. And it will continue to do so. Under our new system, a pensioner with an income of £100 per week from their state pensions, and £20 per week from their private pension, would typically get an extra £15.50 from Pension Credit. That is extra money, topping up pensioner incomes.
And I am clear that that is the right balance. A safety net, in the form of Pension Credit, that ensures a basic income, and gives those with modest savings a higher weekly amount. And on top of this, automatic enrolment and personal accounts, which together will mean that millions of people will have more money in retirement.
This is a balance which will be sustainable over the long term. And that is why we are determined that it is built on widespread consensus – consensus that this is a pensions settlement fit for generations to come
",2006 Speech to Cicero Financial Services Summit,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/james-purnell-2006-speech-to-cicero-financial-services-summit/
Nick Gibb,United Kingdom,2020-07-03,"I can confirm that the Department for Education has today published on www.gov.​
The EYFS statutory framework sets the standards that all schools and early years providers must meet to ensure that children from birth to age five learn and develop well and are kept healthy and safe.
Last October, the Government published a consultation on reforms of the EYFS, following a year-long pilot of the proposed reforms. The objectives of our reforms are twofold. First, we want to raise education standards in the early years through improving early years outcomes for all children, particularly disadvantaged children. Secondly, we want to reduce teacher workload so that teachers can spend more time interacting with and supporting children through rich curriculum activities.
The consultation received 2,452 responses prior to the deadline on 31 January 2020. The areas consulted on and the Government’s response to this are as follows:
The framework also sets out high level educational programmes for each area of learning, summarising curriculum activities for all children from birth to five years old. The consultation indicated broad agreement that the proposed educational programmes support children’s overall learning and development with some suggested changes which were considered as part of the final proposals. The consultation also indicated broad agreement with the Early Learning Goals with some suggested areas for clarification which have been reflected in the final proposals.
Although there was mixed support for this, with the common view from respondents being in favour of retaining moderation, we know from the EYFSP pilot evaluation findings that in the absence of external moderation and associated evidence gathering and paperwork, teachers found that their workload had been reduced, allowing them to focus on teaching. Government will therefore proceed with the proposal to remove statutory local authority moderation.
Removing the “exceeding” criteria from the EYFSP: the consultation indicated broad support for this proposal and our response confirms our intention to proceed with this proposal.
Changes to the safeguarding and welfare requirements as set out in the EYFS framework: we consulted on one minor change, namely to explicitly include “oral health” in the current requirement to “promote the good health of children” in the EYFS framework. The consultation indicated strong support for this proposal and the response confirms the Government’s intention to proceed.
We recognise the impact the covid-19 outbreak has had on the early years sector and schools, particularly in terms of the impact on children’s learning and development as a result of closures.
The EYFS reforms outlined in this response provide a strong basis to support children who may have missed critical months of early education.
A copy of the Government’s response will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

A credible appeals system should have been the Government’s first priority, but three days later there is absolutely no clarity on how young people can challenge their unfair grades.

George Osborne,United Kingdom,2015-11-28,"It’s a great pleasure to be here at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology today.
To be here in this tremendous building.
This lab has a fantastic pedigree – the discovery of DNA by Watson and Crick; 9 Nobel prizes; various spin out companies. And now here you are, the heart of the Cambridge Biomedical campus.
You are testament to the world leading science and innovation that we have in Britain. And particularly here in Cambridge. What you have achieved, together with the rest of the British scientific community, is one of Britain’s greatest and most exciting success stories.
I’m here to talk about British science because it is something that I am personally passionate about.
I get that this is something Britain is brilliant at – and that it is vitally important to our economic future.
So I have made it my personal priority in government to support you in your endeavour. I’ve made difficult decisions elsewhere in order to protect the science budget.
And now over the rest of this decade we are going to invest more in science than ever before.
And I’ve come here with our brilliant Science Minister, David Willetts, to explain more about that.
Our scientific achievements are extraordinary – and I want to celebrate that today.
But we must also confront the hard truths. For decades we have done too little to turn British ingenuity into commercial success. Again and again we have seen the best research in the world developed here in the UK – and then commercialised overseas.
We’re getting much better at avoiding this – we’re making real progress. But we’ve still got a long way further to go.
This support for and application of science is right at the centre of our long term economic plan.
Because that plan is not just about fixing what went wrong in the crisis. It’s about building a resilient recovery.
It’s about creating a balanced economy, that can provide prosperity and economic security for the people of Britain in a global race.
A more productive economy where we invest more, export more, and manufacture more.
And only by capitalising on our great science, can we be the best in the world at manufacturing, at pharmaceuticals, and at technology.
That is the way that we will export more – that is how we will invest more.
That is how we will provide the best jobs and opportunities in the world.
That is the goal of our long term plan for science. Right at the heart of our long term economic plan.
Of course, scientific endeavour is inherently worthwhile in its own right.
It is driven by our deep curiosity about the world around us. Our urge to understand – a mark of our humanity, shared across history and cultures.
And I am hugely proud that Britain has contributed so much to that quest for knowledge – with extraordinary scientific achievements from Newton and Darwin to Higgs and Hawking.
I am proud that we continue to lead the way, even as the race to understand intensifies. Whether exploring the first moments of the universe, or the deep structure of matter, or the power of genetic code – scientists in Britain are leading the way.
Over the past century we have won 78 Nobel prizes. In the past decade alone we have won 12. We have had at least one UK scientist receiving a Nobel Prize in Stockholm every year since 2009.
These British Nobel Prize winners were born in Batley and Hampshire and Newcastle. But we are also a home of world class scientists born in places like Russia and Cyprus. I have been privileged to meet both Konstantin Novoselov and Andre Geim, the co-discoverers of graphene. Both born in Russia, both working in Manchester, and both now knights of the realm. Britain has continued to play a leading role in international projects.
As scientific research becomes ever more global – our openness and diversity makes us ever stronger.
Almost half of our scientists now publish with an author abroad.
We play a leading role in projects like the Large Hadron Collider.
We are now taking a key role in the Square Kilometre Array, the big international radio astronomy project of the next half century.
And next year we will at last have a British astronaut on the International Space Station. These are all massive global projects and it is right that Britain plays a big part in them.
All of this is a source of great excitement for me and for many others.
I’ve seen that excitement in the crowds at the Science Museum, at exhibitions like Collider.
I’ve felt that excitement at places like the new Imperial West campus – where I saw a heart muscle beating on a Petri Dish.
And recently we were honoured to have the British-made Mars Rover vehicle parked for a while in the reception of the Treasury – they said it was trying to find signs of human life.
What you in this room have achieved – what the scientific community of Britain contributes to our country and to the world – is extraordinary. Today I honour that and I celebrate that.
Britain can be rightfully proud of its scientific prowess.
But as I have said, we must also recognise our historic weakness when it comes to translating those scientific achievements into commercial gain.
Time after time, Britain has led the way in scientific research – only to see the commercial benefits accrue overseas.
British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. But it was US tech giants who did the most to turn this technology to massive commercial advantage.
We did the research that led to Liquid Crystal Displays and the flat screen computers and TVs that are now in everyone’s living room and office. But it was countries like Japan and Switzerland who exploited it.
We developed a rocket that could launch satellites into space as early as the 1960s. But we abandoned it. Only now, a generation later, are we once more investing in launch technologies.
UK researchers first spotted the huge potential strength of lightweight carbon fibre, and the Ministry of Defence patented it. It is now a $13 billion market – stretching from lightweight planes to wind turbines. But it is manufactured mainly abroad – not here.
We have some of the best research universities in the world.
But we file fewer patent each year than the US, Japan, Germany, France, China, and South Korea.
And we are getting much less income from our intellectual property than universities in the US.
This is bad for our economy.
It means a less resilient economy.
An economy not playing to its strengths.
Fewer opportunities – fewer jobs.
So a key part of our economic plan is our long term plan for science.
Our plan to break the habit of a lifetime, and get British innovation into British businesses.
So let me tell you how we can make that ambition a reality. How our long term plan for science will give you the backing you need to deliver this nation’s economic future.
There are three parts to that plan – backing scientific clusters; helping scientists make the transition from the lab to the market; and committing long term funding to science.
First, we’re backing Britain’s scientific clusters. Clusters like Cambridge.
Because you are showing just how much Britain can achieve when we turn scientific ingenuity into commercial success.
Cambridge has long been home to one of the world’s greatest universities. And you have some of the world’s greatest laboratories – including this one.
But on the back of that, over the last generation you have built a cluster of innovation that has been phenomenally productive.
Your work has resulted in some of our most important scientific and commercial successes.
Like the antibodies behind six of the world’s top ten best selling drugs – all of which you discovered here in Cambridge.
Or like gallium nitride – used in everything from LED lighting to high performance electronics. Developed here by Sir Colin Humphries, and now being manufactured at scale in Plymouth.
Or Raspberry Pi – a single board computer not much bigger than a credit card. Developed by Cambridge scientists and now selling 2.5m units, all of which have been manufactured out of an abandoned TV factory in South Wales.
Ideas developed here, commercialised here, and now at the centre of Britain’s industrial recovery.
The Cambridge cluster has now spawned 1,500 technology based firms. 60,000 jobs.
Firms created by Cambridge University Computer Lab alumni alone have created £250 million in revenue.
And fourteen tech companies here are worth a billion dollars or more – including companies like ARM, who design the chips inside a significant proportion of the world’s laptops and mobile phones.
It’s an extraordinary story – and I know that with the right support from government, you can do even more.
So I’m here to tell you: we will continue to back Cambridge.
A little over a month ago, in the Budget, I committed funding for a groundbreaking city deal here. That will mean up to £500 million of extra investment in Cambridge – including much needed investment in housing and transport.
Earlier today I also announced £6 million of new funding for the Babraham incubator here. Babraham has already had a huge impact, providing a space where start-ups can be supported to grow with public and commercial investment.
And later today you will be breaking ground on an exciting new graphene and electronics building here. That’s funded with £17 million from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. This will be a place for cutting edge research to be translated into everyday uses for this astonishing material.
I know there has also been a long debate about bringing together our world-class heart and lung centre at Papworth hospital with Addenbrooke’s hospital on the site of the Cambridge BioMedical Campus – and Papworth is working closely with the Department of Health to make sure that its plans are affordable.
But I can see myself a strong case in favour of bringing these two great institutions more closely together, creating a hub of leading-edge medicine, research and pharmaceutical development.
What you’ve achieved here has been called ‘The Cambridge phenomenon”. I want it to be the British phenomenon.
So the government is backing clusters across the UK…
– we are backing the IT and aerospace cluster around Bristol and the South West
– motor car manufacture and motor sport in the Midlands
– oil and gas and offshore engineering in the North East
– the world class life sciences in the cluster stretching from Dundee across to Glasgow and Edinburgh
– and we are investing in the exciting tech cluster linking Daresbury and Manchester
I want new clusters to grow around big data – that’s why in the Budget last month I funded investment in a new world-class Turing Institute for big data research. That centre will keep UK at the forefront of this rapidly moving, globally competitive discipline.
I want new clusters around graphene – with new research centers starting up both here and in Manchester. So backing more clusters like Cambridge – that’s the first thing we are doing to help you.
Second, we’re investing in the centres and in the programmes that help scientists take their inventions from the lab to the market.
I asked James Dyson – one of our greatest inventors, and greatest entrepreneurs – to develop a long-term vision for science and engineering.
He came up with the idea of technology centres – which bring researchers and businesses together to help commercialise technology.
Now, translated into government – we have already set up seven of these so-called Catapult Centres.
They cover everything from Cell Therapy to Transport Systems, the Digital Economy to Future Cities, Offshore Renewable Energy, Satellite technology, and High Value Manufacturing.
Two new ones will kick off next year in Energy Systems and Precision Medicine.
Each one is focused on a globally important area where we show real leadership.
Take the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, which I visited in Coventry earlier this year. I saw their cutting edge 3D printing technology – a technology which could revolutionise everything.
And I saw how they were harnessing incredibly powerful lasers to weld and cut mechanical components with a level of precision and efficiency well in advance of current manufacturing standards. I was told that there’s only one laser in the world more powerful – and that’s the one NASA have to shoot down missiles.
And our Research Partnership Investment Fund has proved that if we invest in great science – business will too. So far we have supported 22 projects with just over £300 million, and delivered a total investment of more than £1 billion.
Cambridge has been a notable beneficiary – the new Maxwell centre will be a centrepiece for industrial partnership in the physical sciences.
Our resources aren’t infinite. We’ve got to make choices.
So we have identified eight great technologies where Britain has real distinctive strengths and there is a global market – and we’re backing them with sustained investment.
Some of them are IT data- based technologies – from big data to satellites and robotics. Others are biological based – synthetic biology, regenerative medicine, agri-tech.
We’re getting behind Britain’s success stories.
Backing our successful clusters.
Backing our successful technologies, getting our innovations to the market here in Britain.
And as a result of our plan, we’re starting to get better.
When we came to government the UK was ranked 14th in the Global Innovation Index.
Now we’re third.
Business research contracts are up year on year.
We’re now producing more spin-out companies per dollar spent than the US.
But there is one more thing we have to do, if Britain is to become the best place to do science and apply it: we have to give British science the funding it needs for the long term.
We’ve had to make difficult choices to cut public spending.
The easy route would have been to cut science spending.
But it would have been painful for the economy and the wrong answer for Britain.
It would have completely undermined our long term economic prospects.
So instead I took difficult decisions elsewhere, so that I could protect science funding at £4.6 billion a year – we’ve in fact increased capital investment in science to record levels.
I can confirm today that we will deliver over the next five years the biggest sustained programme of investment in new science capital ever. We are increasing capital investment to £1.1 billion in 2015-16 and then growing this in line with prices each year to 2020-21.
Investment certainty to the end of the decade –never before has a government set such a long term commitment.
I know that certainty is absolutely vital if you want to attract investment from businesses and charities. If you want to attract world-class researchers and research projects – and global businesses – to Britain. And if you want to embark on the most ambitious, long-term projects that might previously have seemed unreachable.
Today I can announce funding for one such project – a project that exemplifies this government’s long-term commitment to British science.
I am today committing over £200 million to build a new polar flagship.
Britain has a great history of polar exploration and science – a history of Scott and Shackleton, and many other explorers, who all had a close link to this city, home of the British Antarctic Survey and the Scott Polar Institute.
In recent years our scientists have made some astounding breakthroughs at sea. We have detected the world’s most extreme deep sea volcanic vents in the Cayman Trough. And made the first ever extensive measurements under a rapidly melting Antarctic shelf.
We understand that what happens in the Arctic and Antarctic have a huge impact on us – and research we do there will have a massive impact on our understanding of changes in our climate, and in our ability to forecast the weather. That’s hugely important.
We have two aging polar exploration ships reaching the end of their life.
The easy choice would have been to not replace them. But that would have been a huge mistake for the long term.
Britain must keep a presence in these parts of the world.
So instead we’re going to replace our aging ships with the best in class.
Our new £200 million polar flagship will be the most advanced oceanographic research vessel in the world. It will be carrying the latest cutting edge technologies.
And will mean scientists can do research for more of the year, can reach areas they’ve never been able to penetrate before, and will be able to bring back huge amounts of data on the ocean and marine biology.
We have a proud history of pushing at the boundaries of scientific discovery.
Today we’re making sure we continue that tradition- at the most extreme ends of the world, where there is still so much discovery to be done.
This is just one of the many projects we can invest in because we’ve taken the difficult decisions necessary to protect the science budget.
It’s just a small part of a huge wave of new investment in science that we are now embarking on.
In total we are talking about £7 billion of capital investment in science over the next parliament. And this Autumn we will set out in detail how it will be allocated.
But rather than us deciding where all that money goes, I’ve come to ask you.
My message here today is that it is over to you.
The government is committing a historic £7 billion to science investment.
Today I’m launching the consultation – asking you, the science community, and business too – how best to invest that funding.
How to maintain excellence – and where are the new opportunities that will put Britain ahead in the global race?
There are many cutting edge projects and facilities that we could invest in.
We could invest in ramping up the power of the Large Hadron Collider.
New investment could enable scientists to search for particles that explain the dark matter that seems to make up the bulk of the material in our universe but still remains a theoretical mystery.
That research could potentially unlock nuclear fussion – with massive economic benefits to this country and the world. And we could invest in bridging the gap between genomics and phenomics.
We were at the head of the genome revolution. Phenomics is the next big challenge.
Research in this area could result in much higher crop yields and better treatments for diseases – with potentially huge benefits to our agricultural and biotech industries.
We could invest in next generation imaging technologies which would step up the speed and scale of biological research. We could see robot scientists sequencing huge numbers of samples automatically. That would be invaluable in designing new drugs and therapies for patients.
The Central Laser facility operates five state of the art lasers for UK researchers and business. But without continued investment these facilities could fall behind.
The Vulcan laser delivers a focused beam which for one tiny fraction of a second is 10,000 times more powerful than the national grid. This puts us at front of the world – but to stay there Vulcan needs to be made twenty times more powerful.
This would give us the highest intensity laser anywhere which could also develop new ways of producing nuclear power.
And we could invest in new research facilities to keep British manufacturing at the sharp edge of innovation.
This might mean new systems for producing materials without interruption 24 hours a day.
And it would complement our hugely successful High Value Manufacturing Catapult and have huge benefit to advanced manufacturing across the UK.
These are just a fraction of the opportunities we have before us.
We have some tough and exciting decisions to make over the coming months – and I’m relying on the help of you in this room and the rest of the scientific community to make sure we get it right.
In this country we really are on our way to be the best place in the world to do science. The best place to innovate.
But the rest of the world won’t just stand still.
That’s why, as part of our long term economic plan, we have to keep working through our long term science plan. That’s why we’re:
– backing successful clusters like Cambridge
– investing in the eight great technologies where Britain has distinctive strengths
– helping innovators as they make the journey from the lab to the market
– taking difficult decisions on other areas of public spending, so we can commit to unprecedented long term investments in science
And – as I’ve announced today – that’s why we are making sure all our decisions to invest will be led by the real experts, in the scientific community.
I’m proud of British science. I’m proud of you in this audience today.
That’s why we will keep taking the difficult decisions, and keep investing in our long term plan for science.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2015-08-02,"Good morning, Chuck.
Well, I think a lot of people did not believe I was going to be running, Chuck.  And they thought it was-- you know, they didn't want to waste poll, though, so to speak, and they really felt that I wouldn't run.  I mean, I have a-- a wonderful life.
I have a wonderful-- I built a tremendous company.  And, you know, a lot of good things going on.  And they said, why would he give that up to go into this fray? And once I announced, as you probably know better than anybody, my poll numbers started to shoot up like a rocket ship and they continue to go up.
And a couple of polls came out recently where I'm number one with Hispanics, as an example in Nevada.
And North Carolina was very strong. Nevada was very strong overall, too. It was number one place in both cases. I mean, it's been-- it's been terrific.
Well, I don't think they understand my message or maybe they haven't heard my message yet. But I noticed that in certain states like North Carolina, we have a very strong favorability rating and others-- and other places, including New Hampshire, including Iowa, there's a very strong favorability rating. And I noticed that as I get to areas-- I've been in Iowa a lot, I've been in New Hampshire a lot, I've been in South Carolina a lot. And where I go and where I speak, they really change those numbers very quickly.
Okay.
Well, I'm not a debater.  I don't-- I've never debated before.  I've never been on a stage debating.
I guess my whole life has been a debate in one way.  But I've never been on a formal stage debating.  So I really don't know.
I understand you have nine other people that are going to be shooting at me, and that may be true or maybe not.  But I-- I really don't know.  I-- I don't have pollsters, I don't want to waste money on pollsters.
Because, you know, they-- I don't want to be unreal.  I want to be me.  I have to be me.
You know? We have enough of that in Washington with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and-- and the lobbyists, et cetera, et cetera.  And the donors.  I see the donors all over the place.
I know them.  And I know they don't give because they happen to be nice people.  So I think that really-- you know, who knows? I-- I certainly-- I think I know most of the subjects very well.
I've been through it. A lot of people have been asking me a lot of questions for three or four months. And-- and we'll what happens. But again, I don't think you can artificially prepare for something like this.
Well, I think I'm a nice person.  I-- I really do.  And I think that's why my numbers always go up as they get to know me better.
I think that, frankly, I'd like to discuss the issues.  I'm not looking to take anybody out or be nasty to anybody.  And as you know, Chuck, you know, when I made-- you know, harsh statements about various people, that was always in response to their criticism of me.
You know, Rick Perry, I always thought he was a nice guy, but he started hitting me hard, so I hit him harder. And I'm not, you know, looking-- I don't know what they're going to be doing. I'm reading so many, you know...
I think it's highly unlikely. I really do.
I-- I've always counterpunched. And you have to--
...counterpunch. But I'm not looking to start anything, that's for sure. I'd rather discuss the issues. Our country is in serious trouble, and we have a lot of problems in every front. And I'd rather discuss that. But, you know, I-- I read people and I listen to you and others, and a lot of people say or they're getting ready and they've got their little lines given to them by the pollsters. You know, everything's perfectly put down by a pollster, what to say and how to attack me. And, you know, if that comes, it comes, and I have to handle it at the time.
Well, it's all true and we do have a lot of different policy programs and I think they're going to be-- I don't know, popular.  But they're going to be something that's going to set the country back right.  I mean one of the big things is we have to take back jobs from China, we have to take back jobs from Japan and Vietnam and Mexico and virtually everybody that's taking our jobs and ruining our manufacturing base.
And we have to put people to work, Chuck, because the real number is probably 21 percent.  The real unemployment number is probably 21 percent.  People give up looking for jobs, and they no longer become a statistic.
And it's very unfair. So we have to put our country back to work. We have to get great jobs for people, and good paying jobs for people. And we're going to be just fine.
Well, I-- I don't have a choice.  I would say this.  I think with what she is doing and how she's coming out, she has, you know, she's got a terrible record.
She's probably the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.  And she's now, you know, the e-mail thing, I mean-- what they did with Petraeus is they destroyed his life.  What she did is far greater and far worse than Petraeus did.
So I would think that she at some point, you're going to get a prosecutor who's going to be an honorable prosecutor, and there's going to be major problems for her. So I would think other people would be looking.
I-- I think he's-- I think he's fine. I mean I think he's fine, if he runs, he runs. I mean you have to worry about-- I like to do things nice and systematically. Right now I have-- I guess you could say 16, because somebody else just joined. So I have 16 opponents and I'd like to focus on them and then I'll focus on Hillary. And I actually think Hillary will be easy if it's her. But I'm not so sure it's going to be her.
It's a massive crisis. It's a double-crisis. So what's happening-- and-- and people, you know, I-- I look at things and I see it on television and some horrible mistakes are made. At the same time, we have to give power back to the police, because crime is rampant. And I'm a big person that believes in very big-- you know, you-- we need police, and we need protection. Look, I look at some of the cities, you look at Baltimore, you look at so many different place in this country, Chicago, certain areas of Chicago...
...they need strong police protection. And those police can do the job, but their jobs are being taken away from them. At the same time, you've got these other problems, and there's no question about it, they are problems. There's turmoil in our country.
Well, I can certainly see it when I see what's going on.  But at the same time, we have to give power back to the police, because we have to have law and order.  Hundreds of-- of killings are in Baltimore, hundreds of killings are in Chicago, and New York is not doing so great in terms of that front and so many other cities.
We have to give strength and power back to the police. And you're always going to have mistakes made and you're always going to have bad apples. But you can't let that stop the fact that police have to regain some control of this tremendous crime wave and killing wave that's happening in this country.
Good. I do, too. Thank you very much, Chuck.

Nigel Adams,United Kingdom,2020-02-07,"My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Baroness Morgan of Cotes, has made the following statement.
On 5 February the Government launched a consultation on decriminalising TV licence evasion. The consultation invites views from both members of the public and organisations on whether the Government should proceed with the decriminalisation of TV licence evasion by replacing the criminal sanction with an alternative civil enforcement scheme.
Decriminalisation of TV licence evasion was previously looked at by David Perry QC, and he concluded that the criminal penalty remained appropriate under the current licence fee model. However, it has now been five years since the Perry review. The broadcasting landscape has changed significantly, not least because five years ago a TV licence was not required to watch or download content on BBC iPlayer. As well as this, the BBC’s decision on the future of the over 75 licence fee concession means those aged over 75 and not in receipt of pension credit may become liable to face TV licensing enforcement procedures.
Given such changes, the Government believe that it is right to look again at decriminalising TV licence evasion in order to ensure a proportionate and fair approach to licence fee penalties and payments is in place, which protects the most vulnerable in our society.
Against this background, the consultation will seek responses on whether to decriminalise evasion and give consideration to how this could happen. The determining factors that the Government will consider include:
Would an alternative, non-criminal enforcement scheme be fairer and more proportionate?
What the cost is and how difficult it would be to implement any alternative scheme?
What is the potential impact on licence fee payers, particularly the most vulnerable and those with protected characteristics?
And what is the overall impact on licence fee collection?
The consultation will remain open for a period of eight weeks, after which the Government will carefully consider the responses. A consultation response will be expected to be published by summer 2020. Any changes will not enter into effect until April 2022.
The closing date and time for responses is 5 pm on 1 April 2020. A copy of the consultation will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

Franklin D. Roosevelt,United States of America,1937-01-20 00:00:00,"When four years ago we met to inaugurate President, the Republic, single-minded in anxiety, stood in spirit here. We dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision -- to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness. We of the Republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it; to end by action, tireless and unafraid, the stagnation and despair of that day. We did those first things first.
Our covenant with ourselves did not stop there. Instinctively we recognized a deeper need -- the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization. Repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered. For, without that aid, we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind. To do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men.
We of the Republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable, to solve problems once considered unsolvable. We would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as, after centuries of fatalistic suffering, we had found a way to master epidemics of disease. We refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster.
In this we Americans were discovering no wholly new truth; we were writing a new chapter in our book of self-government.
This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Constitutional Convention which made us a nation. At that Convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the Revolutionary War; they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution. A century and a half ago they established the Federal Government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the American people.
Today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives.
Four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct. They hold out the clear hope that government within communities, government within the separate States, and government of the United States can do the things the times require, without yielding its democracy. Our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday.
Nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase, so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil; power to do good. The essential democracy of our Nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power, but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections. The Constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent.
In fact, in these last four years, we have made the exercise of all power more democratic; for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public's government. The legend that they were invincible above and beyond the processes of a democracy has been shattered. They have been challenged and beaten.
Our progress out of the depression is obvious. But that is not all that you and I mean by the new order of things. Our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with second-hand materials. By using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations.
In that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit. Old truths have been relearned; untruths have been unlearned. We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics. Out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays. We are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal; and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world.
This new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such. We are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life.
In this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned. Hard-headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness. We are moving toward an era of good feeling. But we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will.
For these reasons I am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of America.
Among men of good will, science and democracy together offer an ever-richer life and ever-larger satisfaction to the individual. With this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order, we have set our feet upon the road of enduring progress.
Shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead? Shall we call this the promised land? Or, shall we continue on our way? For ""each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.""
Many voices are heard as we face a great decision. Comfort says, ""Tarry a while."" Opportunism says, ""This is a good spot."" Timidity asks, ""How difficult is the road ahead?""
True, we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair. Vitality has been preserved. Courage and confidence have been restored. Mental and moral horizons have been extended.
But our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstance. Advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering. The times were on the side of progress.
To hold to progress today, however, is more difficult. Dulled conscience, irresponsibility, and ruthless self-interest already reappear. Such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster! Prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose.
Let us ask again: Have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of March, 1933? Have we found our happy valley?
I see a great nation, upon a great continent, blessed with a great wealth of natural resources. Its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves; they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations. I see a United States which can demonstrate that, under democratic methods of government, national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown, and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence.
But here is the challenge to our democracy: In this nation I see tens of millions of its citizens -- a substantial part of its whole population -- who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life.
I see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day.
I see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so-called polite society half a century ago.
I see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children.
I see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions.
I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.
It is not in despair that I paint you that picture. I paint it for you in hope -- because the Nation, seeing and understanding the injustice in it, proposes to paint it out. We are determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country's interest and concern; and we will never regard any faithful, law-abiding group within our borders as superfluous. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.
If I know aught of the spirit and purpose of our Nation, we will not listen to Comfort, Opportunism, and Timidity. We will carry on.
Overwhelmingly, we of the Republic are men and women of good will; men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication; men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well. They will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will.
Government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people. It can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts. It can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government does.
If I know aught of the will of our people, they will demand that these conditions of effective government shall be created and maintained. They will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and, therefore, strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace.
Today we reconsecrate our country to long-cherished ideals in a suddenly changed civilization. In every land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and forces that draw men together. In our personal ambitions we are individualists. But in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation, we all go up, or else we all go down, as one people.
To maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods, a vast amount of humility. But out of the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need. Then political leadership can voice common ideals, and aid in their realization.
In taking again the oath of office as President of the United States, I assume the solemn obligation of leading the American people forward along the road over which they have chosen to advance.
While this duty rests upon me I shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will, seeking Divine guidance to help us each and every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
",Second Inaugural Address,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-10-14,"Thank you, thank you. Great, wow. Thank you very much. Thank you, wow. Thank you, wow.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice place, plenty of room.
In 25 days we're going to win the state of North Carolina, which I love, and we're going to win the White House.
Early voting starts on October 20th, so you have to get out there. But November 8th, that's our day. November 8th, right? November 8th.
But do the early voting.
I'd also like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone recovering in the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. We know about it very well unfortunately right here. We send our deepest condolences for those who have lost loved ones. We are with you and we will always be with you and help you when needed. So, good luck to everybody.
The incredible spirit of the people of this state will power its recovery, and it's the same spirit that will rebuild our nation. I have property in this state, this is a great state.
You know my property. Beautiful properly, great employees. In the Trump administration we will end decades of policies that enrich special interests and foreign countries at our expense. We're going to take on the big media, big business, and big donors that are bleeding our country dry. We're losing our jobs.
We're going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals and illegal immigration. Stop the massive inflow of refugees. Take care of our vets, our great vets. And we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 100 percent. That is a disaster. Premiums are soaring double digits in North Carolina, beyond anybody's wildest expectations. It's a disaster and you're -- and you know what's going on. Your country will be left with only one insurer. You're going to have nothing, everyone's leaving. And you have one insurer. You're going to have nobody. Obamacare if failing, we're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it.
Your jobs come back under a Trump administration. Your income goes up under a Trump administration.
Your taxes go way down under a Trump administration.
You companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump administration, they'll be staying right here. And believe me, there are plenty of them right now negotiating to leave, I hate to tell you that.
These are the issues that we'll discuss at the next debate, which I look very much forward to.
Crooked Hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate. They say she's doing debate prep but, really she's just resting, she's resting.
For what -- for what she's done, they should lock her up, they should. It's disgraceful. Honestly, it's disgraceful. What's going on in our country right now is a disgrace. The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake on November the 8th. WikiLeaks released new Clinton campaign e-mails revealing how friendly Hillary was with the attorney general, Loretta Lynch.
This was only months prior to Lynch's investigation of Hillary's illegal secret e-mail server that gave foreign governments access to our confidential information.
This comes on the heels of disclosure that Clinton campaign was conspiring and colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the release of her e-mails and the investigation into her server.
Hillary Clinton told the FBI 39 times she couldn't remember anything. I couldn't remember, I couldn't remember. Or recall key events concerning illegal server and related misconduct.
Now, in new written testimony, just out as part Freedom of Information Act request, Hillary Clinton said she couldn't remember, recall, or anything else, key events and key things 21 different times.
It's one more reason that if I win I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor.
And we also have to investigate the investigation itself.
Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after a congressional subpoena. She got a subpoena from Congress and she said, this is no good, this is terrible, because those 33,000 e-mails had bad stuff. And she said get rid of them, delete them, bleach them.
Nobody bleaches because that's an expensive process. She bleached. Get rid of them. And then she made everybody get rid of iPhones, her iPhones, and some of them were hammered. They were hammered to death. All to cover up her crimes. Yesterday new disclosures were made showing again how Hillary Clinton's pay for play works.
Saudi Arabia paid Bill Clinton a lot of money to make a speech and then got an arms deal from Hillary and her State department that they were unable to get. The nation of Qatar also kicked in $1 million for Bill Clinton's birthday party, so nice. But, as WikiLeaks showed the Clinton's ripped off the people of Haiti as they were suffering and dying after the earthquake.
And her brother's on the board of a gold mine, her brother. But, the media's covering up for the Clintons and their many crimes against so many people. The WikiLeaks documents show how the media conspires and collaborates with the Clinton campaign including giving the questions and answers to Hillary Clinton before the debate, OK.
What a rigged system folks. Last night, we had a massive crowd of over 20,000 people in Cincinnati, filled up an arena.
And the media won't even talk about the size of the crowd, the enthusiasm of the crowd. I watched NBC this morning, they said, last night Donald Trump was in Cincinnati.
If Hillary Clinton has 800 people, the crowd is so big.
It is horrible -- it is really horrible. The corrupt media is trying to do everything in their power to stop our movement. Believe me, they don't want this happening. We have one of the great movements -- we have the great movement. We have a movement that's never happened before.
And no paper is more corrupt than the failing New York Times. The good news is it is failing, it won't be around too much longer. But they are really, really bad people. The largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim. Now Carlos Slim, as you know, comes from Mexico. He's given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives. So Carlos Slim, largest owner of the paper, from Mexico.
Reporters at the New York Times, they're not journalists, they're corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton. We're going to let foreign corporations and their CEO's decide the outcomes of the -- you just can't do this.
We can't let this happen. We are not going to let it happen where they decide the outcome of our elections. They can't do it and we're not going to let it happen. This is our last chance to save our country and reclaim it for we the people, and it's going to happen.
Oh, it's going to happen. As you have seen, right now I am being viciously attacked with lies and smears.
It's a phony deal. I have no idea who these women are, have no idea. I have no idea. And I think you all know I have no idea because you understand me for a lot of years, OK.
When you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said I don't think so. I don't think so.
Whoever she is, wherever she comes from, the stories are total fiction. They're 100 percent made up, they never happened, they never would happen. I don't think they'd happen with very many people but they certainly aren't going to happen with me. Folks, you know my people always say, oh don't talk about it, talk about jobs, talk about the economy. Don't worry, your jobs are going to be coming back to North Carolina like you've seen, the economy's going to be good.
But I feel I have to talk about them because you have to dispute when somebody says something. And fortunately we have the microphone, we're able to dispute, some people can't. These are lies being pushed by the media and the Clinton campaign to try and keep their grip on our country. They are all false, they're totally invented, fiction. All 100 percent totally and completely fabricated. Never met this person, these people, I don't know who they are.
I don't know who they -- think of what's happening to our country. Think of what's happening. I don't know who these people are, I look on television, I think it's a disgusting thing and it's being pushed. They have no witnesses, there's nobody around. They just come out. Some are doing it for probably a little fame, they get some free fame. It's a total setup. Now suddenly after many, many years, phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country.
It also comes at a time as WikiLeaks unveils horrible, horrible things about Hillary Clinton.
But they'd rather talk about this. Somebody that you've never seen that said, oh, 1992 he went like this.
One came out recently where I was sitting alone in some club. I really don't sit alone that much. Honestly, folks I don't think I sit alone. I go in with groups of people -- I was sitting alone by myself, like this.
And then I went whaw.
To somebody. I just heard this one. It's like, it's like unbelievable. Even a simple investigation would've shown these allegations against me, in just about all cases, it's nonsense, it's false. And eyewitnesses already debunked to a People Magazine story.
Here's my question about the dishonest writer from People Magazine. Why didn't she write what she said happened before we wrote the story, why didn't she put it in the story? The story would've been one of the big stories.
I was the big star of the Apprentice, why didn't she go it 12 years ago? Twelve years ago. She's writing a story -- no think of this. Think of this. She's right, she's a liar. She is a liar. She's writing a story -- check our her Facebook page, you'll understand. Hey, she's writing a story about a beautiful love story, Melania, Donald, and she said I made inappropriate move.
Now, just so you understand. That's a big story. If I did. She wrote the most beautiful story, honestly the most beautiful story, 100 percent story, like beautiful. Why wouldn't she have put this into the story?
Now, two nights ago I get a call. Oh, People Magazine's doing a story. It's OK. No, no, it's not OK, it's about a story that was written 12 years ago. She was on last night, or one of the top people that People was on, and he said, no, we were just informed of it.
Well, did you hear about it 12 years ago? Did you hear about five years? No, no, we never -- we just heard about it recently. These people are sick. These people are sick. And the reason she didn't write it 12 years ago is very simple. It never happened, it never happened. It's a lie.
It's a lie. And let me tell you, if it did happen, if it did happen, it -- 100 percent she would have written it, it would have been the biggest story of the year, OK? These are all horrible lies, all fabrications and we can't let them change the most important election in our lifetimes. If five percent of the people think it's true and maybe 10 percent think -- we don't win. In other words, they make lies. They have people come around, oh Donald Trump did this or that. I never saw these people before, I don't know who they are.
And then you watch these phony networks, and dishonest networks, who are 100 percent -- let me tell you something about Hillary Clinton. She's got nothing going, she's got nothing. The only thing she's got going is the media. She's got nothing going. She's got nothing. The other day at the debate, where by the way, I absolutely destroyed her, OK.
Every online poll, even Time Magazine, Time Magazine is not exactly in love with me but every online poll had us skill -- she said, the other day I'm standing, I told you this. But I'm standing at my podium and she walks in front of me, right? She walks in front of me, you know?
And when she walked in front of me, believe me I wasn't impressed. But she walks in front of me and she takes a question, then she walked back, and that was the end of that, no problem.
Then she said the next day, I invaded her space. Give me a break. And I was waiting for that because she had that incident once before where they made up something. Some guy invaded her space, the poor guy lost the election because of it. But I was very conscious of this so I purposely, I purposely didn't do anything. So -- get this guy out of here. Get him out of here, out.
Get out of here.
It's really total disrespect for the American flag. There he is. Look, good. Great. Folks -- folks, that's what's happening to our country, that's what's happening. That is total disrespect for our flag, that's what's happening to our country. We're going to turn it around, folks -- we're going to turn it around.
So -- so, just to finish up -- so just to finish up, you see what's happening. The process is rigged. This whole election is being rigged.
It's a lie, total lie, it's fabrication. Sometimes they do it for fame, maybe they get money, who knows? The Clinton campaign is pushing it.
The New York Times did a story on somebody where it was totally false. They knew it was totally false. We gave them the information, they wrote a whole big page about somebody where they were sending me e-mails, and letters, and everything, and then you realize -- it was a one-way send, by the way, there was nothing sent back -- and you realize it was a totally phony deal. They did a whole big story on it.
They didn't mention all of the e-mails, they didn't mention everything coming my way. And others looked at it and, as bad as it was, soon as they saw this stuff that was said, they immediately -- immediately decided not to do this. The New York Times did a story on it.
They read these stories and people might not know how untrue they are. It's really a disgrace. I've been saying this for a long time. The whole thing we've been going through, and I hate to say it but, the whole thing we're going through -- Bernie Sanders was a rigged deal -- the whole thing is one big fix, it's one big fix.
It's one big ugly lie, it's one big fix. The press can't write the kind of things they write, which are lies, lies, lies. The stories are fabrications and false. And the only thing I say is hopefully, hopefully, our patriotic movement will overcome this terrible deception.
Hopefully, our great movement -- and there's never been anything like this in the United States. And the only way they figure they can throw it down is to come up with people that are willing to say, I was with Donald Trump in 1980. I was sitting with him on an airplane, and he went after me on the plane. Yeah, I'm going to go after.
Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you. Man.
You don't know, that would not be my first choice. Hopefully our great movement powered by everyday citizens will overcome the sickness that is plaguing our politics and our media. And I'll tell you what, our media is indeed sick and its making our country sick, and we're going to stop it.
We're going to stop it folks. All right, let's get on now, let's get onto another subject. But isn't it good that we talk about this? Right? Who thinks I shouldn't talk, we're talk jocks, right? Who thinks that I shouldn't talk about it? Does anybody think that? OK, I agree.
When somebody, you know, a long time ago - when you get hit, you hit back, you've got to do it. You don't just say I didn't get hit
I ran because I knew what trouble our country was in. The country is in tremendous trouble, you know this. You know this in North Carolina, because you see what's happening to your jobs, they're disappearing.
I know it's not about me, it's about you, and that's why I'm doing this. I didn't need to do this, but it's about you. It's about bringing our country, making our country great again. I'm taking these slings and arrows for you, so we can have our borders, so we can get back our jobs...
...so we can be a safe nation again. You know, the murder - the number of murders in our country this year, went up more than they have in 45 years.
It's true. Look, Obama is an incompetent. He is an incompetent president.
He doesn't know what he's doing, he's out campaigning all day long, he talking about me like he knows me. I don't know him, he doesn't know me.
And why doesn't some woman maybe come up and say what they say falsely about me, they could say about him. They could say it about anybody, they could say it about anybody. I'll tell you what, he better be careful, because they could say it about anybody, anybody at all.
But Obama is in incompetent, as a president, he's about as bad as it gets. Look at what's happening, how Iran is taunting us. Look at what's going on, look at the world.
He gives away $400 million in cash, but it turns out to $1.7 billion in cash. Gives them $150 billion...
This guys doesn't know what he's doing, it's an embarrassment. If you look at the Middle East, it's a blow up, it's a total disaster. We have an incompetent president. I hate to say it, but it 100 percent true.
And all he's doing, instead of working on your jobs and your companies leaving for Mexico and other places, he's campaigning for crooked Hillary. That's all he does.
Either we win this election or we're going to lose our country, because 4 more years of Obama, you can't take it.
WikiLeaks documents, Hillary Clinton speaking in secret - oh man, you saw those too, a secret Brazilian bank. Hillary Clinton said my dream is a hemisphere common market with open trade and open borders.
There go - even though she doesn't say that, but that's what she said in a very, very secret meeting. The e-mails show that behind closed doors speaking to these international bankers, Hillary Clinton's pledged to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.
And yes, we will build a wall.
Crooked Hillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees to pour into our country.
. This - even though she admitted it private, according to WikiLeaks, again, nobody is covering WikiLeaks.
They're covering somebody that I never saw before, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate the refugee program. So you have terrorists coming in, she knows they're coming in, and yet she wants to increase it.
And our country will never be the same. So let me state this as clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
At the same time, we're going to take care of our military and we're going to take care of our great, great, great veterans.
They've been treated very badly.
That includes - veterans' choice so veterans can either attend a public V.A. facility or if they have to wait online like they've been doing, sometimes for as much as seven days and then still not get proper care, they'll go to a private medical center or they'll go to a private or public or something, they will go outside...
...they'll go to a private doctor, they'll go to a private hospital, they'll go to a public hospital. We're going to get them care and we're going to pay for their - that care.
They're not going to wait online. For seven days and die sometimes waiting online for a simple, simple procedure or prescription. It's not going to happen like that any longer for our veterans, OK? Not going to happen.
And Hillary Clinton said, no, no, the V.A. is doing a good job, OK.
North Carolina is home to more than 100,000 active-duty military personnel and almost 800,00 veterans.
The military supports over half a million jobs in this state. We are going to repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and we are going to rebuild the military of the United States which is very, sadly, depleted.
When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in a three and - I think you believe in these words, I think - three very important words, peace through strength, right. Peace through strength.
And we don't want to use our strength, but you have to have our strength. And the world is laughing at us. They're laughing at the stupidity of our President. Remember he drew the line in the sand -- the line is in the sand. Remember Hillary the last debate? I wasn't Secretary of State then.
She doesn't even know. It turned out she lied. Remember she said TPP was gold standard, she said she never said that during the debate. She lied about that. She's a liar.
But to be a strong country, we must also be a very rich country. At the center of our economic revival we'll be fixing our really horrendous, one-way street, horrible trade deals.
We're going to fix them folks. You know, last year we lost almost $800 billion in trade deficits. We have trade deficit with other nations of almost $800 billion. And I have some friends in the audience, I guarantee I can take any one of those friends - one in particular who happens to be brutal but that's OK, lives in North Carolina, so you know, one of those things, right, but a great business person.
I put him in charge - this case him - we would have such a good thing. And there are people like that. We have the greatest negotiators in the world, we have the greatest business people in the world, we don't use them. We use political hacks. So we have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion.
Sad, isn't it? Isn't it pathetic? North Carolina's industrial workers have been crushed by Bill Clinton's signing of NAFTA supported by crooked Hillary. Don't forget, a lot of people want that to happen because they make a lot of money by taking money out of this country. Those deals are very good for a lot of people.
A lot of people know - everybody knows that NAFTA is no good for the United States, but it's good for their wallets in some cases. You've lost nearly half of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, did you know that? You've lost almost half of your manufacturing jobs.
This region used to be the furniture manufacturing hub of the world. I know because I bought plenty. But the NAFTA deal and then China's entry into the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary backed disaster, have sent those jobs to other countries. You know better than anybody.
I used to be here a lot for furniture, gets smaller and smaller every year. Not going to have anything left pretty soon. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our jobs have been stolen from us and we have people that don't know what they are doing, in particular our leadership.
If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA.
If we don't get the deal we want, we leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better, a much more fair deal because right now, we're a one-way highway into Mexico, a one-way highway.
I mean, you take a look at this, it's one way. They get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the cash, and all we get - we get illegal immigration and we get drugs. And the drugs are poisoning our youth, the drugs are poisoning our youth and others. But we're getting the drugs and we're getting lots of problems. And I'll tell you, I was endorsed by the, as you know, by ICE just last week, and by the border patrol agents.
Sixteen thousand five hundred Border Patrol. They've never -- they've never done this before. They've never done -- they've never endorsed a presidential candidate. Both groups endorsed me. Because we're going to have strong borders. And we're going to have people come into our country, but they're going to come in legally, legally.
And we're going to stand up to China, we're going to stop their currency manipulation and product dumping, which is killing us. And they don't follow the rules and, if they don't, we're going to institute tariffs. When they send something into our country -- and, believe me, they're going to obey our rules so quickly, you have no idea. And we'll end up with a better relationship with China than we do now.
Look what they're doing, they're building a massive fortress against everything. A massive fortress in the South China Sea. And yet they're ripping us off. Now, if they're going to rip us off, you wouldn't think they'd be building fortresses. They have no respect for our President -- which I can understand that -- they have no respect for Obama, they have no respect for our country, and they're getting away with murder.
And we have the cards, we have the cards. We have all the cards. Because we're like the piggy bank that everybody keeps stealing from. But pretty soon we're not going to be piggy bank anymore. We're going to be the opposite of the piggy bank.
We don't have -- we are $20 trillion, half of which came during the Obama years. And yet we didn't fix anything. Our roads are bad, our bridges are bad, our tunnels are bad, our schools are bad, our hospitals are bad. We're going to start making things again in America. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 tax, the biggest since Ronald Reagan.
Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing, rushing back in to our country.
We're also going to fix our inner cities. Forty-five percent of African-American children are -- under the age six -- are living in poverty. Think of it, 45 percent. Fifty-eight percent of African- American youth don't have jobs.
More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Three thousand people since January, three thousand. It's like a war zone. Violent crime in Greensboro increased by 25 percent last year. Did you know that? Twenty-five percent.
To those African-Americans suffering in our country, I say, what do you have to lose? Vote for Trump, I'm going to fix it. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose.
I will fight harder for you than anyone has fought for you before. Here are some of the more amazing things we're going to do when we take over, hopefully, this incredible country and run it properly in 2017.
We going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, we're going to eliminate job-killing regulations which are a disaster, we are going to defend religious liberty.
We're going to end Common Core. Going to bring our education local.
We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement, repeal and replace Obamacare.
We are going to save our Second Amendment.
We're going to appoint great justices to the United States Supreme Court to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
So you have 25 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true. But to beat the system, you have to pound the pavement, get your friends and co-workers out, organize your neighbors and fight for the country you want.
On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, it's time, all right.
I am asking all Americans, Republicans, Independents and Democrats, to join us in our campaign to defeat the corrupt establishment and give our government back to the people. It's going to happen.
I'm going to fight for every citizen of every background. Thank you.
Thank you. So we're going to fight and we're going to fight for every stretch of this nation. And I'm going to fight to bring us all together, we're a divided nation. Very divided nation right now. We're going to be unified nation, a nation of love.
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one American flag.
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, and we're having a good time. We're having a good time.
You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like nobody's ever seen in this country before. Even our enemies admit that. We're going to make history together, you're going to look back at the election, on November 8th, and you're going to say it is the most important vote you've ever cast because that's when our country started working again.
'-- became safe again. That's when our country became strong again and rich again. And we will make America, just like your beautiful hat, we will make America great again. Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you everybody. God bless you, go out and vote November 8th.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Greensboro, NC",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-greensboro-nc-october-14-2016
Ian Percival,United Kingdom,2019-08-21,"I hope to respond immediately to that plea. The House owes an enormous debt to Lord Roskill and his colleagues for the time and expertise put into producing the report. We also owe a considerable debt to Mr. Walter Merricks. I say that not merely because he is my wife’s nephew, but for two other reasons. I once made a dissenting report and I know what ​ it means to do that. The second and the main reason is that I agree with so much of what he says. He will know that that has not always been the case.
I want to concentrate on making one point arising from the report. The two principal features in the report are pretrial preparation and whether we should do away with juries in fraud cases. They are intimately bound up with one another. I think that there are constitutional and philosophical reasons for keeping jury trials in cases where the consequences may be serious for the accused. I also think that there are both emotional and logical reasons for keeping juries in such cases.
However, there is an even better, and practical, reason why we should not try to implement that recommendation at the moment. That is the fundamental reason put forward by the Roskill committee for abolishing juries, namely the complexity of certain fraud trials. Looking at it practically, one of the major reasons why cases are so complicated when they get to trial is that they have not been properly prepared. I do not say that as a criticism of anybody involved. At every stage, those who have to prepare the trials are having to overcome practical obstacles that would defeat most people. It is a miracle that some of the cases come to trial in as orderly fashion as they do.
I want to support with all the emphasis that I can the recommendation that we should look urgently at preparations for trial—all pre-trial stages—and here we have a large number of positive recommendations. I doubt whether everybody would agree with every one of them but I am sure that everybody would agree that that is what we have to look at first. I believe that the Criminal Bar Association also has some further proposals in that area.
My plea to my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench is to concentrate on that part of the report and get on with it, with all the assistance possible. I am sure that both sides of the profession will give their help. A lot of advice might also be obtained from the accountants, many of whom are now specialising in doing the groundwork in preparing cases for a fraud trial. Let us see how far we can get in simplifying the trial itself before we contemplate doing away with what, after all, has been regarded in this country for a very long time, as one of the principal safeguards of the liberty of the subject. I do not say that that tradition can justify sticking with one system for ever in all cases, but it should make us slow in abolishing it and especially abolishing it in any trial where the consequences for the accused of being found guilty may be very serious.
My plea to my right hon. and hon. Friends is get on with it. I am not just supporting the recommendations concerning pre-trial matters. My plea is, let us get on with them, with considering and implementing the improvements we can make in pre-trial preparation just as quickly as possible. The beauty of it is that hardly any of that needs legislation. All that it needs is the will to get on with it. Let us leave other considerations about juries until we have tackled this first and done something about it.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-04-26,"I'm very good. Thank you very much, Mark.
Well, you know the country is doing fantastically well and they can't get over it. The economy is as good as it can be. Numbers have been fantastic. We're -- we're just doing great. The -- you look at the unemployment numbers, the best in 51 years, for individual groups like African-American, Asians, Hispanics the best they've ever been historic numbers.
And I don't know they're having a hard time with it. Regulation cuts, tax cuts, tremendous tax cuts, biggest that we've ever had bigger than a man did you admire, Ronald Reagan, bigger than his cuts. ANWR was approved in that one. Individual mandate, we got rid of it, the Obamacare disaster, and there's a lot of things and they're having a hard time with it. It's -- when the Mueller -- when the Mueller witch hunt ended and the report came out, I thought people would say, well that's the end of that.
And instead, they say, ""Well, let me see."" They analyzed 400, now when it came to analyzing the Russian stuff, there was nothing they could even analyze. There was nothing, that's put away, I mean to even think about, so ridiculous. But then they talk about obstruction, and I have a clean bill of health for obstruction, absolutely nothing done, but they -- they'll do whatever they can to try and sully a reputation so they can win an election in 17, 18 months, hard to believe it's coming up again, Mark.
Well, to the best of my knowledge is not a word in there about the call-me leaks and they call-me lies and there's not a word in there about McCabe and Strzok and his lover Lisa Page. There's not a word in there about all of the dishonesty, the $33,000, 33,000 e-mails from Hillary Clinton. And don't forget the 600,000 text messages from -- that went through the server of Wiener -- of Wiener, that's a beauty, not a word in there about any of this -- this corruption, now that's pure corruption, but not a word in there of the other side, but it's -- it's rather incredible, rather incredible, very disappointing.
But we have a great Attorney General and we'll see how that all comes out in the end. But it is really incredible that you can do a report and not even mentioned the other side. You look at the fake dossier, turned out to be a total fake. Even the New York Times, I couldn't believe it, Mark, The New York Times the other day talked about the -- the fake dossier and very unglowing terms, I couldn't believe it actually.
But they do something like that, no mention of it. They do all of this dishonest stuff, the FISA reports, no mention of it. It's a disgrace.
Well, you know, I could have not let anyone speak during the Mueller report including lawyers and everybody that works at the White House, and executive privilege, they call it, some people say Presidential privilege, which is at a very high level. I could have said, ""Nope, Presidential privilege."" But I said, ""I have nothing to hide."" You know that, you know me well and I'm not into the world of ""Gee, I'm going to Georgia, let me call Russia for some help.
OK."" So ridiculous, the whole thing, although if you look, Hillary Clinton and the DNC and the Democrats, we're dealing with Russia, which is very interesting. And President Obama knew all about Russia in September just before the election and didn't do a thing about it because he thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.
So he didn't do a thing about it. He only got upset about it after the results were very conclusive, 306 to 223. So you know, you look at what's going on, but I could have exerted, I could have taken Presidential privilege for the -- for everybody, but didn't I read where they had 500 witnesses, 500. Spent $35 million had angry Democrats, angry, these were angry people.
These were really people that did not like Donald Trump. And you know, Mueller didn't like Donald Trump and he had conflicts all over the place. And with all of that, no collusion and obstruction was also a big win. If you look -- I mean he didn't charge for now, I always hear if you don't get charge, you're not supposed to be writing, you're virtually not allowed to be writing.
If you don't get charged, you don't write. I wasn't charged and they write whatever they want to write. But it was an incredible success and I -- meaning it was an incredible -- in a way it was an achievement because when you have haters and people that were angry, if you look at Weisman, he was at Hillary Clinton's, what was going to be a celebration in their opinion.
And it turned out to be a funeral after the election, right after the election at the big convention center, which was so beautifully done, right after the election, the night of the election, and he was a very angry man. And then all of a sudden he's investigating you and they come up with no collusion.
It's pretty amazing. I think he found it amazing too.
Right.
Well to think that these guys were so wrong and they got Pulitzer Prizes, and they're all wrong and that Sean Hannity and you, and I could go through a whole list, Laura and Tucker, and I mean, Jesse, everybody, there's so many at Fox, there's so many all over the place. You look at Steve Doocy in the morning and Ainsley, and Brian has been become great on this subject.
I mean, nobody is mentioned for these awards and they were all right. And yet you have people that were the biggest haters of all that were so wrong. I mean, if you went back to their original reporting, it's embarrassing to read it for them and they win Pulitzer Prizes. It's a rigged system and it's a shame.
No, they don't and you know, I must say many Democrats are talking a lot differently now than they were even three or four weeks ago. And on that one, you know, I've had to fight a lot of people in politics. I've had to fight a lot of people and we've taken the bull by the horn. And don't forget we have, you know, if you look at what's -- these people have been, we've used the word ""capture"", use whatever word you want.
The Border Patrol has been incredible, but we're talking about 100,000 people a month. And I told about two weeks ago, I made a very strong statement. And I mean it -- to this day, I said, if this -- if these people flow through Mexico, I'm closing the border, that's a very big move because you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.
I'm closing the border, that's more important than hundreds of billions. But I said it and all of a sudden as you see Mexico is -- is taking people, bringing them back to their country. They're grabbing them and they're bringing it back to their country and I just see an account that just came out that they just sent 15,000 back to their country, 15,000. Now they weren't doing that for any President.
You know this has been going on for years, Mark. This isn't just now and I've been talking about it. If you remember in Trump Tower, when I came down the escalator with a very wonderful woman in a white dress, you remember that?
Our now First Lady and I announced -- and I talked about -- I gave a rough speech on the border. Well, that speech is peanuts compared to what reality is OK, it's far rougher that was a mild -- Remember how I was just lambasted, I've mentioned the word rape, I mentioned other words that are not politically correct.
It turns out that they we're all very mild compared to the actuality. It's a -- this I mean it's brutal. Even that trip up, you know the trip up, it's 2,000 miles and what goes on in those caravans, what's going on is incredible, nobody could even believe it. But we've been very, very strong. We're making a lot of progress.
You're going to start seeing some pretty good numbers coming out in a month. Mexico now is, you know, it's a tough situation, but Mexico now is bringing a lot of people on that walk, they're bringing it back to their countries. They're bringing them right back. And today it was over 15,000 people. So we're making a lot of progress, but I'm willing to close that border.
Now it could all be solved very easily if Congress would sit down with, I say 45 minutes, but it's really 15 minutes. In 15 minutes I could have the whole problem solved. You get rid of Catch and Release you work on the asylum laws, which are very simple to work on. Mark, people come up that are the roughest looking people you've ever seen, they read a statement given them -- given to them by one of our lawyers, living in California.
They read the statement that I am afraid for my life, I am afraid -- in some cases these are MS-13 gang members, OK. They make other people afraid. They come in waving the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador, waving the flag and then they're saying -- they're swearing that they're afraid to be in their country.
Well, what are they waving the flag for? It's a -- it's a con game. And you know, we're totally wise to it if we had some simple changes in the law to make common sense, it would be done. But I'm doing it anyway. We're now detaining them before they get here. You know, once they -- once they step, once they have one foot, it's like a football game.
Once they have one foot on our soil, Mark, they are -- it's almost called ""Welcome to the United States. I hope you enjoy your stay."" It is a disgrace, but we're being very, very vigilant. The border patrol's been great. ICE has been incredible. When the Democrats want to get rid of ICE. You know we're -- we're taking out thousands of MS-13 gang members.
These are people that even top law enforcement people don't want to get involved. This is a rough group of people. They should never have been in here in the first place. They've come in here over years, they're rough and these people go right into a nest of MS-13 and in many cases they're swinging. They -- I don't know.
They love their job, but I don't know if you'd like, Mark.I don't know what you think of that. I don't know if I'd like it too much, but they are incredible. And can you imagine the Democrats want to, you know, end ICE. You and I should -- this country would be crime infested and with all of that we're talking about the crime numbers have gone way down since I've become President.
You see that. So you know, we're very proud of a lot of achievements and maybe especially the economy, the economy has been incredible.
Right.
That's a terrible thing that they keep bringing it up and I actually said two different ways and I said it every way, you can say it, but I said you have bad people in both groups, you have good people in both groups. Don't forget --
Oh, absolutely. Oh, no, I only met the protesters, but if you remember that started over the statue of perhaps the greatest general in the history of our country in terms of strategic brilliance. If you go to generals, a lot of generals I work with, many of them, think that strategically and in many ways Robert E. Lee was the greatest general they have in Charlottesville, where I have a big property.
I have a big house in Charlottesville, believe it or not, the John Kluge estate and you know, you go and you look at this incredible, what was, incredible statue of Robert E. Lee on a horse, and many of those people were from University of Virginia, they were from all around the neighborhood, the area, they just wanted to protest the fact that they want to take down the statue of Robert E. Lee.
Now there were a lot of good people in that group and they were protesting the taking down of statues. Now some people are for that and some people are not for --
No, no, I'm talking about people that were there. You -- and you had some very bad people in each group too. You had some very -- don't forget that was the beginning of Antifa. That's when you first started hearing the word Antifa. I'm not sure I heard the name Antifa before Charlottesville.
And they were hitting people with clubs and sticks. I don't know saw that --
You had bad people in both -- on both sides also and I said that.
Well, I have to say that you know, look the standard answer, I'll run against any of them. Do I have a pick? Maybe, I'll tell you when I'm with you. First off, I want to thank you. You have been so brilliant and so good and it's -- it's been incredible. The show you did on television the other night, I tell people was like total genius.
It was like you built a building like you were building from the foundation all the way up and exposing the witch hunters and exposing the -- the whole really horrible thing that they created out of absolutely nothing. That was the only thing they did well. She didn't run a good race, but she sure as hell built a good thing after the race and actually during the race because you know that didn't start with Mueller that started long before Mueller, that was a coup.
They were really -- there was a coup that started long before Mueller. And that was the whole thing with dirty cops and FBI and all of the things that you know about better than anybody else. I mean, if you look at the -- the people involved in that horrible situation --
And that was a very dangerous thing for our country and -- and now people understand that, really they understand it, but you know they'll go on. But I think -- I think it's embers now. I just think it's a little embers I hope so anyway, because it's so bad for our country puts us in such a bad light. It really -- it really hurts us as a country.
But I think -- I think we've done a good job.
They have lurched left and I watched Bernie the other day talking about, you know, prisoners can vote and --
I said Well, I actually said because then they went into that at first. They said prisoners and they said, well, that means the Boston bomber, you know, they used a couple of beautiful examples like the Boston bomber and he said that includes the Boston bomber. And I said, Whoa, that's heavy stuff. And then you hear other people more or less agreeing with him that you know are running and I think it's amazing, but I don't mind, I don't mind campaigning on the fact that I will not allow ever to have the Boston bomber be voting OK. I don't mind that -- I think that's not -- I don't lose any points with the -- with the world of politics with that, it's ridiculous.
But that's what I'm running against and it is amazing to me and to you how far left these people have gone. But yes, we'll expose it for what it is.
Thank you.
Right.
Well, I -- hey, Mark, if I could, I'd just like to thank the farmers because you know, we're doing great trade deals and they're going to be among the biggest beneficiaries they've been so patriotic so loyal and they're starting to do really well. And you know they've been going down for 15, 20 years a long time, but the farmers, and we rebuilt the military and we will -- you mentioned the courts, we'll have very shortly within another couple of months, I'll have 145 federal judges including two on the Supreme Court, 145, nobody would have thought that's possible, and 145 --
It's a big percentage of -- all top notch. So we're very happy with that.
Well, I really appreciate it. I love your show and I -- you're a very special man and I appreciate it very much, and you've been with me from early on and very early -- almost at the beginning. You take little -- you took a little side path for a few months there, but that was OK and he happens to be a good man.
He -- he ended up doing a good job. Ted, I understand I can understand that too, but I really do appreciate it, Mark, very much.
Thank you very much. I'll see you soon. Thank you, Mark.
",Interview: Mark Levin Interviews Donald Trump on The Mark Levin Show,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-the-mark-levin-show-april-26-2019
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-10-04,"Boy, oh boy. This is a group. So -- . So, I've been doing this for a long time. That is the loudest I've ever heard anything in this room. You just broke the record. Unbelievable. Well, I want to thank you all. And I have a lot of friends, but -- and this is a place.
1799 it was built. 1799. Started off with number six -- John Adams, President. And so, it's a long time. It's the White House, and we love it, and it's an honor to have you. But you really did -- you broke the sound barrier. I've never heard that. I've never heard it quite like that, and I appreciate it. We love you. We love you.
Thank you. Thank you. And I'm honored to welcome everybody and these incredibly talented and unbelievable, patriotic, young American leaders. You're going to be the leaders. Somebody -- I would be almost willing to bet, maybe even willing to bet -- somebody in that audience, right here, right in front of me, is going to be standing here someday.
I think so. You're going to have a good shot. You've done incredible work to get to this position, and I have tremendous respect for it. We're glad to be joined by our terrific Vice President, Mike Pence. And many of our Cabinet members are here.
They wanted to be here. I told a couple of them, ""Don't have to. Don't worry about it. What the heck. These are my friends."" They said, ""No, we want to be here."" So we have a lot of our Cabinet members here. And to every young person: You represent America's future. You are the best and the brightest, the bravest and boldest, and someday you are going to be setting records like nobody before.
I'm telling you, I know it. I know where's it's at. I know where energy is, and you have the energy like very few people have the energy. So I just want to tell you: Get out there. Prove me right, please. Okay? Prove me right. I have no doubt you will. Each of you has come to Washington for the Black Leadership Summit because you have -- what it takes to achieve real change on your campuses and in your communities, and that's what you've been doing, and that's actually why you're here.
You speak out for the values and principles that have made America the most exceptional nation anywhere on Earth. And I will say this today: It's greater than it ever was before -- our military, our economy. We have the greatest economy in the world. We have the greatest economy we've ever had.
Tremendous numbers just came out today. You heard that. But you stand up for the oppressive forces -- and you do. You stand right up to those forces in our country that demand conformity and control. You refuse to be censored, you refuse to be silenced, and you will never back down. And don't. Don't ever back down.
You're the champions for free thought and free speech. And I especially want to thank a friend of mine who is -- I mean, first of all, you think he's like 50, but he's about 25 or something like that. He's a young guy. I can't -- I can't even imagine being so successful at such a young age.
What he's done in so many ways -- and, really, more importantly, letting young people know that they have a voice. Charlie Kirk, from Turning Point U.S.A. Charlie, you've done a fantastic job. Fastest-growing organization of thought -- of thought -- in the country. He is something. Thank you very much, Charlie.
I appreciate your being here. And we're also joined by a friend of mine -- just got married -- just got married. And Candace Owens -- I watched her, and I saw her coming. I said -- you know, I'm pretty good at star power. I look, and I say, ""That's a star."" Every once in a while, I'll see somebody.
You know, it happens about once every five years. That's all it is. But I'll be watching. I saw Candace probably three, four years ago. How long would it be, Charlie? Four? Maybe four. I saw this woman on television. I said, ""Man, I don't want to mess with her. She's tough. She's tough."" Now, I'm not allowed to say it -- you know that.
I'm not allowed to say it anymore, but she's also beautiful. So, I'll say that, too. Okay? It's true. Under the #MeToo generation, we're not allowed to say it. So, all of you young, brilliant guys: Never ever call a woman beautiful, please. You're not allowed to do it. And I've kept doing it, and I've never been told by that woman never to do it. Just say, ""Thank you, sir."" Candace, would you come up here, and say a few words?
Do you mind? Come. Thank you, Candace. Thank you.
We have no choice.
Thank you, Candace. Thank you. That's so nice. Outstanding person. She's another one. You're going to have to compete with her, too, for this position, I suspect. Thank you very much. You know, it's sort of interesting. It's like: Do we have a choice? We have to fight, right? We have to fight.
We have to fight for everything, whether we like it or not. Another man who has been so incredible -- Ja'Ron Smith. Where is Ja'Ron? Is he around here? Ja'Ron Smith. Man, have you done a job. You've done such a great job, Ja'Ron. At least come up and shake my hand, will you, please? Come here, Ja'Ron. You know, he works with us, and he's actually not -- I always say he's so elegant and so quiet and so nice.
They say, ""You don't know the real Ja'Ron."" So I want to see that. But what he does and the job he's done on outreach and so many other aspects of our lives is incredible. I want to thank you, Ja'Ron. Thank you very much. I want to thank you for that. I appreciate it. Thank you. And Ja'Ron knows what I'm about to do because -- a man who I met on Twitter, or, as we would say, ""social media""; he is some piece of work, this guy -- he was hitting Debra Messing like she never got hit before.
This crazy Debra Messing started messing with us. And all of a sudden, I see this man on Twitter, and I see him all over. And he was hitting her and I never saw anything like it. I felt so sorry for her. And then, I look and I say, ""Who is this guy?"" His name is Terrence Williams. I look -- and I look and I said, ""Well, you know, the way you look…"" And the first thing I look is, how many followers does he have?
And he had like 700,000 followers. I said, ""Whoa."" You know, oftentimes I'll be impressed by somebody. I'll look and they have three followers, they say. I say, ""We have to wait for him or her."" But this guy has a following like very few people. And I want to just thank you because I'm a fan of yours, also. You're a very successful guy. Say a few words. Please.
Thank you. He is something. And he's a talented, talented guy. And when he started talking, I wasn't -- man, I watched it once. I watched it twice. And then I called the First Lady over. I say, ""What do you think of this guy?"" Thank you very much, Terrence. We appreciate it a lot. We come together at a time of extraordinary opportunity for our nation.
Thanks to our pro-American agenda, the economy is booming, wages are rising, and poverty is plummeting. We have the best economy we've ever had, and believe me, we're just getting started. We have such potential. Such potential. Last month, the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in over 51 years -- 3.5 percent.
People didn't think they were going to see that a couple of years ago. If I would've said that, the fake news would've said, ""This guy is exaggerating."" Wages are up by almost 3 percent in the last three years. When I was campaigning three years ago, and people were making less and less and less -- they were making less three years ago.
You go back 20 years from then, they used to make more money with one job than they made with two or three jobs. And now, for the first time in many, many years, wages are rising again. The unemployment rate for African Americans is at the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country. And African American youth unemployment -- young, African American talented people recently reached the lowest rate ever recorded.
So how do we lose that debate? We'll be up and somebody will say, ""I'm going to do this."" I say, ""Folks, how old is your country?"" African American -- the best numbers you've ever, ever had. And I could go into plenty of other numbers. For the first time ever, as an example, the most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women.
The African American poverty rate has reached its lowest level in the history of our country, so that's good. And they're working hard, they're finding jobs and they're getting good jobs. And if you don't like that job, you can get another one because you have a lot of choice.
It's like the military; we got them Choice in the VA. They can go find another doctor. They can go out -- you know, by the way, just because a lot of people are vets -- the vets were treated horribly. You don't hear that anymore. You don't hear it. Now, they'll go out and find some vet somewhere in this country that isn't happy.
And that person will become a star overnight, right? But you don't hear it anymore. But we did a thing called Choice. And that's where people were waiting -- our great veterans were waiting for two days, five days, five weeks, months to get a doctor. Now they don't have to wait at all. They go outside, they get a good doctor of their choice, and the doctor gives us a bill, we pay the bill.
And you know, the least important thing is it actually costs us less. That's the least important. The most important thing is we take care of our vets. Our vets were dying waiting to see a doctor. They'd go in -- think of this. I mean, many of you, you go see a doctor. It's not that big a deal. They would go see a doctor and they'd be waiting on line for weeks.
And they'd be sick, but not bad. By the time they saw the doctor, they'd be terminally ill. And we don't do that anymore. So it's a big thing. They've been trying to get this approved by -- for over, I guess, Mike, over 45 years, and we got it done. We're good at getting things done. And how much sense does it make?
So, it's good. So you have Choice, also. You have choice in your jobs. You don't like your job, you go out. We have a great economy. You go out, get another one. And it's incredible how well you're doing. Our agenda is lifting up citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed.
But while we are fighting every day to build up our nation, the far-left only wants to wreck, ruin, and destroy our nation.
And you know better than anybody: For the last three years, Democrat lawmakers, their deep-state cronies, the fake news media, they've been colluding in their effort to overturn the presidential election -- 63 million people voted -- and to nullify the votes of the American people. And many African American people voted for Trump even then.
Now they like me more, because I said I was going to do it and now I did it. So you better vote. I said I was going to do it. I said, ""I'm going to do it.
But you remember, I'd make speeches and I'd go through a list. I'd be talking about the African American community and I'd go through a list of worst poverty levels ever, worst crime ever, worst schools ever, worst this. I'd go through 10 things. I'd read off from a list. And at one big rally -- I had 25,000 people -- I said, ""Go with me. What the hell do you have to lose?"" Remember that, Candace?
I said, ""What do you have to lose? You're doing the worst in every category. You're getting just -- it's terrible. What the hell do you have to lose?"" And I'll never forget, I got off stage and my people came: ""Sir, that wasn't very nice."" I said, ""No, it's true."" What do they have to lose? And you went with me, and I did get a good vote, I have to say.
You went with me, and now you have the best employment numbers you've ever had, the best numbers, the best poverty numbers. So, it's good. But the radical Democrats are willing to do anything to smear anyone and to lie about everything in their craven quest for power and money and other things, I guess.
I don't want to tell you what those other things are, but they're not good. Although, maybe when the cameras shut off, we'll talk. They're trying to steal your vote. They're trying to steal your voice and steal your country. They're trying to steal your country. And they don't have what it takes.
Shifty Schiff. How about ""Shifty Schiff"".
He got four Pinnochios today in the Washington Post. He lies like a son of a gun. He's been lying for three years. But we will never let that happen, where they take away your country. We will uphold the sacred principle of government by and for the people. That's you. The corrupt forces in Washington -- and they are corrupt -- and that includes the media, because large parts of the media -- not all of it. You have some great journalists, reporters.
But large portions of the media are corrupt, perpetrating these hoaxes like never before. The very same people who have made a living selling out American workers to foreign countries. They were closing the factories. You're losing your jobs. They leave our country, they make the product, they sell the product in. No tax, no nothing.
So we ended up with empty factories and no jobs, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, and jobs by the millions. These are the same bought and paid-for politicians who let special interests write the laws, who push trade policies to enrich foreign nations, and who beg far-left judges to rewrite the Constitution of the United States to impose their their own extreme ideology.
No one in America has been hurt more as a result of the Democrats' corrupt leadership and socialist policies than our nation's African American communities. It's true. That's true. It's true. For a hundred years -- for a hundred years, African Americans have gone with the Democrats. Has it worked.
Has it worked? For -- actually, I guess, Candace, it's even more -- but a hundred years. And you look at what's going on in the cities run by these crazy left Democrats, and what's going on is not good. My administration is fighting with everyone, and all our heart -- to reverse the pain inflicted by Democrat leaders and to deliver hope and opportunity and prosperity for all Americans, but for African American communities all throughout our land.
Together, we will express the corruption, we will defeat the socialists, we will defraud. And I tell you what: We will do what we have to do, but we will stop defrauding all of the people in our country, because they've defrauded the people in our country. We'll defend democracy. And, yes, we will drain the swap.
But that's what we're doing. African Americans built this nation -- you built this nation. You know, you're just starting to get real credit for that, okay? I don't know if you know that. You're just starting to get -- you built the nation. We all built it. But you were such a massive part of it -- bigger than you were given credit for.
Does that make sense? Right? But with Candace around and Terrence, that's not going to happen for long. You know, at the border, where they want the open policies -- they want open borders.
They don't want walls. They actually do want walls, but because I want it -- you know, I know how I can get the wall. If I announce tomorrow, ""I don't want a wall,"" the Democrats would come out in favor of the wall. I should've thought of that two years ago. But the wall is being built. It would've been a lot easier.
We don't want the wall. ""We want the wall."" I say, ""All right, go ahead and build."" Our philosophy is grounded in the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. And we really have been united. It's been an incredible thing. A lot of great things have been happening. You don't necessarily see it at the top of government, where the hatred is tremendous -- the hatred toward us. And a lot of it is because of the success.
We're having such success. We're showing them what's going on -- when you look at your unemployment numbers, how great they are. The best in history. You look at your employment numbers. You look at the poverty numbers. You look at all of the things that have been so beneficial, it's driving them crazy, because they never produced numbers like that.
And they're losing African American votes, and they can't do that. They just can't do that. They haven't done anything for you. They haven't done anything. A hundred years -- they haven't done anything. At long last, you have a government that puts Americans first, puts you first, puts your families and your communities first.
We're adopting ""Buy American"" trade policies to stand up for our workers. Our tax and regulatory reforms are stopping the outsourcing of jobs, where they outsource all your jobs to other countries, and keeping businesses in America where they belong. And keep your jobs where your jobs belong. We're fighting every day to secure our nation's borders and to achieve an immigration system that prioritizes American families, wage-earners, taxpayers, and people that can help you and can help our country.
To keep our cities safe, we're supporting the brave men and women of ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement. And you'd be amazed at how many African American people come up, and they have people living near them that are brutal killers. They're killers. But you're tough; you fight back. But sometimes you don't win those fights, because these guys are tough, too.
They shouldn't be in our country. And it's really amazing to see what some of our law enforcement does and how much they love you. And that's the fact. That's the fact. And we're lucky to have them. To revitalize distressed neighborhoods, we created something that I'm very proud of. Tim Scott, South Carolina.
You know Tim? Tim Scott has to get a lot of credit. He came to me with Jared, and he said, ""So, we'd like to do Opportunity Zones."" I said, ""What's that?"" But once he told me, I said, ""Maybe that would work."" And I think, Jared, it's one of the great -- it's one of the great unknowns of the successes that we have.
Thousands and thousands of zones in inner cities and poor neighborhoods. Tremendous investments going in. Tremendous jobs are happening. Revitalization is happening. It's been incredible for the African American community. I don't think there's ever been anything. It's early yet. It's a year and a half.
But, Ja'Ron, I don't think we've ever had anything quite like it. And people don't like writing about it because they don't want to give the Trump administration credit. But I'm used to that. I'm used to it. You got to get used to it. You know who knows, though? The people know. The people know.
Thank you. Because, really, no American community is going to be left behind. Any community. To help former prisoners get a second chance at life -- we passed groundbreaking -- and this is with liberals and conservatives -- some of the most conservative people in the Republican Party were so in favor of it. Senator Lee -- Mike Lee, of Utah, great guy.
Senator Grassley, great guy -- Iowa. So many people. Criminal justice reform. Everybody said it couldn't be done. And a group came to my office, ""Sir, please. Please, would you help us?"" These were liberal people. And I said, ""I will."" Van Jones was one. Nice guy. I wouldn't say treats me too good, but that's okay.
Van Jones. And he said, ""Sir, we need your help. We can't get five senators. We can't get this, we can't get that. We need your help. We need your help. Please, sir, help me! Please, help me!"" I said, ""I can get you those five senators."" And I called five or six or seven, to get the five.
Sometimes you have to call a little more than the five if you want to get the five, right? You'll learn. A couple said, ""Could I take a pass on this, sir?"" But I got five people. Right, Jared? And we got the vote, and people were shocked. And nobody else could've done it. And they've been trying to change this for the African American community, for the Hispanic community, for other communities, but, really, the African American and Hispanic communities, by far, benefitted the most.
And they've been trying to do this for decades. It started with the Clintons. It was not good. Right.
No, remember when she ran and she had that young African American woman who was tough? Maybe it was Candace. Could that have been you, Candace? But -- no, I don't think so. But I remember how she was so angry at Hillary Clinton. But they passed that. And it was horrible for the black community, for a lot of communities, but in particular black and Hispanic and some others.
And I said to a senator, ""It's a great thing. We got to do it."" People are in jail for 40, 50, 60 years for a crime that isn't even a crime today.
Right? Isn't that right.
Our friend, Jared -- we have number of them, but we helped a couple of our friends -- a lot of our friends now. We pardoned certain people. Who you would say, Ja'Ron? Who would you say in particular? Go ahead. Give me a couple of names, because we had -- you know, who I'm talking about? Alice. Right?
We had a woman -- Alice Johnson. We had a woman, Alice Johnson, who was this lovely woman, and she was in for about 22 years already. I mean, she's served 22 years, and I think she had another 25 or 26 to go for making a phone call. And, look, she admits she did wrong. But, today, it would be a slightly different -- like, maybe not enough, to be honest with you.
But it would be very different. So she was in and she was a wonderful woman, and Kanye West came and Kim came, and they said, ""President, could you do this?"" I said, ""Do what?"" ""Do what? What are you talking?"" ""A woman has been in jail for 22 years. She's got another 28 to serve, I think.
Something like that."" Think of that. And she's got another 28 to serve and she's a great woman and she's a wonderful woman. And I -- I get along with Kanye for a long time. You saw the way he -- when he was with the White House; he puts the hat on. I think for one day I went up through the polls like through the roof.
I'll tell you. He is -- with the African American community, they like Kanye and they like Kim Kardashian. And we pardoned her and we worked it so that she was going to be able to get out -- a form of a pardon, where she could get out. And she came out. And I'll never forget the scene: She comes out of this big prison -- mean, mean prison.
Not too many of them are nice, right? But she comes out through the doors, and there are her children, but her children are now very grown. Big strong guys, beautiful women, beautiful -- just a big family. And they just embraced. They just embraced. And it was on television all over. And the love, it was just incredible to see.
And the tears -- and they were just like one. It was incredible to watch. And I said, ""We have to do it with others."" And you called Alice, I know that, Ja'Ron and Jared.
Come on. Give -- give those names. They're great --
Right.
Right, Brenda.
Right.
Right.
That's right. The prosecutors are doing things that they weren't doing before, right? That's right. Thank you very much. That's great. Boy, that was a -- you have a good memory. That's very good. Huh, because you work with it, right? It's from the heart. When it's from the heart you always remember.
That's great. And we have many others. And we're going -- like we'll going to Alice, and we'll say, ""Alice, who knows better…"" because you can't let everybody out because, frankly, some are going to be there and they deserve to be there. But we say, ""Alice, who else do you think in that prison -- you grew up, you were there for so long -- 22 years -- who else do you know that should be let out?"" And she gave us some names.
And not even that many names, but she gave us four, five names. And I guarantee you those are great people. They've been in there also for many, many years. And they got to be friendly. And afterwards -- she's smart. After all those years, she knows the good. And I have no doubt that it will work out.
And we're getting them out now. We're in the process of getting them out to be with their families. So it's great. It's great. It's been a great thing. But I did want to say -- so Van Jones was on about two weeks ago and he came to me and -- I'm telling you, he was so nice. He was sitting right there when I was doing it. And I said, ""Thank you, Van Jones.
Thank you."" This one, this one, that one, that one. And that was it. And he came up to me, thanked me. And that was it. Then, about three weeks ago, I saw him on television. I don't watch his show too much, neither do too many. But I'm watching him and he gets up and he goes, ""I want to thank a number of people, because we did something this year that was undoable.
They said it couldn't be done. We passed criminal justice reform."" Okay? Van Jones said it. ""And I want to thank Reverend Al Sharpton."" Well, he wasn't nowhere. He was nowhere to be found.
Just so we know, I've known him for a long time. He used to love me. We used to go to fights together with Don King. Don King is a friend of mine. Don King endorsed me. And Don Kin and Al Sharpton get along. We used to go to fights together, and he liked me until I ran and succeeded in politics. Then it wasn't to his benefit.
But, look, Al is a con man. We all know that. Just a con man. He's a con man. And he scared NBC into giving him a show. You know, they don't want to have any trouble. But he's a -- just a, sort of a third-rate con guy. But here's Van Jones. Here's Van Jones. Van Jones: ""I want to thank Al Sharpton.
I want to thank all of these people."" He's naming people I never heard of. The only one he didn't mention was me. And then it got worse. You ready? Candace, listen to this. Terrence, are you listening? So he named these people -- a lot of people -- standing at the end of a show.
I want to thank -- because this was the greatest year we've ever had. We got criminal justice reform. I want to thank this one and that one and that one and that one. I never heard of any of them. And I kept waiting for my name. I said, ""Darling, come over here. I'm going to have a great, really, little name mention."" ""Yes, darling."" The First Lady -- how good is the First Lady?
So she came over. And I kept waiting, and I kept waiting, and then he named a lot of people. That was the end. I said -- I was a little embarrassed in front of my wife. I said, ""He didn't name me. I'm the one that did it."" I called up Jared. Right, Jared? I said, ""What the hell is this?"" But before that -- he did have one other thing to say.
This was three weeks ago. He said, ""And I have one thing to say that we have to do. We must defeat this President.
We have to defeat President Trump. And we have to work 24 hours a day to defeat President Donald Trump. And I called Jared, and I said, ""That's terrible."" Right? Is that a true story? And then he spoke to Jared and he apologized, didn't he? He apologized. But I don't accept those apologies, you know?
All right. Should we get back onto script, okay.
No. They say, ""No."" This is more inter- -- they don't want to go back onto -- this is much more interesting. We love you folks, okay? We love you. Van Jones. Van Jones, he's another beauty. Thank you very much, Van, for the wonderful acknowledgment. I appreciate it. To give every American child the best chance to reach the American Dream, we are fighting for school choice.
Very important. Sadly, Democrat lawmakers care more about catering to lobbyists and powerful teachers' unions than they do about improving our schools for our children. And Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than about their own African American constituents. It's true. They want to give healthcare to people that just walked into the country.
And for you, they don't care. The whole thing is crazy. These people have gone absolutely nuts. While we're fighting for the American way of life, the hard left and the radical left is working to trample the rule of law, erode individual liberty, and exert a far-reaching control over our lives. Left-wing censors have launched an all-out campaign against free speech.
That is why they are trying to silence, de-platform, cancel, punish all of the proud conservative voters, all of the proud African American voices that know what's happening and know how to become big, big, successful people, help other people. They want to silence you. But we know the patriots in this room will never be intimidated.
I know that. I know that. So here, with us today, is Kearyn Bolin, President of the Texas State University -- that's a big deal -- Turning Point USA Chapter, who has bravely defended the right to free speech. And, Kearyn, would you please come up and say a few words? Please. Thank you. I thought so. I love her hair.
You look great. That's beautiful.
Thank you. Thank you, Kearyn.
Thank you very much, Kearyn. I got to get the other cheek. You've done a fantastic job. I appreciate it. In order to protect the rights of our students, I signed an executive order making clear that public colleges and universities shutting down free speech will risk losing all of the billions and billions of dollars that we give them.
So we'll shut down their federal taxpayer dollars that go to them. And then they shut down speech. And they just choose whoever it is. They'll let somebody speak, they'll tell other people you can't speak, and then we're supposed to give them, individually, hundreds of millions of dollars. It doesn't work that way anymore.
I've also tasked my administration to explore every possible solution to stop social media giants from restricting your rights to speak your mind. And, Candace, you had a problem with that, I know. And other people have had a problem. Some people in this room have had a problem. Terrence, have you had a problem with it? Huh? Terrence has had a problem.
It's incredible. It's incredible. Yeah, no, a lot of people have. But not the other side of the world. The other side doesn't have that problem. Very rarely do they have it. We must preserve the fundamental American rights that generations of Americans have sacrificed everything to secure. With us this afternoon is Ben Okereke.
That's a great name. I love that name. When Ben was 14 years old, he legally immigrated to the United States after suffering many hardships in Cameroon, which I hear is a beautiful, beautiful place. Cameroon. Wow. One person from Cameroon. To give back to our country, he joined the United States Army and honorably served for four years -- as a very talented field artillery specialist.
A lot of talent, they say. Ben, we salute your noble service. And please say a few words. Ben. Please. All yours.
Thank you, Ben.
Thank you, Ben. And that's from the heart. That's from the heart. That's what it's all about. The young leaders in this room remind us that true power in our nation is not found in government or hallways or anywhere; it's found not in the media boardrooms. It really is where the strength is. It's in our people.
It's in your hearts. It's in your courage, your spirit, your faith, and your pride. Together, we will defend the benefits and the beliefs that you want, and you have, and you're entitled to; the traditions and God-given freedoms that make our country the greatest in the world -- and even, I think we can say, right now, the greatest in the history of the world.
Just like your unemployment numbers -- greatest in history. That's the greatest in history, also. You are my friends. I'm never going to forget you. You've been incredible. You've been incredible. Whether it's Ja'Ron -- the job you do; or Charlie, I appreciate it; or Terrence; or Candace, you're all special people.
Very, very special people. And you're doing something very important. I don't even know if you know -- maybe you don't know. And, you know, sometimes you're so into something, and you just don't really feel how important it all is. What you are doing is so important for your community and for this country.
We will renew the values that unite our people as one America. As one team, we will build up our nation, we will lift up our forgotten communities, and we will defeat any threat. We will beat any challenge, we will overcome every obstacle, and we will achieve a glorious future of American greatness beyond our wildest dreams.
And that's what you're doing. To everyone here today: Keep up the great work. And I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart: God bless you. God bless your families. And God bless America. Thank you.
",Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the 2020 Young Black Leadership Summit,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-young-black-leadership-october-4-2019
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-04-04,"What a group. Thank you.
Thank you. This is so great. Nice place. Beautiful theater.
Yes, a very good poll, a good company. Let's see what happens. And then the only poll that matters is tomorrow, right?
She does say that.
Well, I think I really said, Hey, I could've done without it. And it's true. And I wish I didn't send it out. It would have been simpler. It was done as a little bit of retaliation. But in the end, it's so -- you know, it's just something -- if I had it to do again, I would not have done it.
Right.
Lyin' Ted. We don't know what, but he lies. Lyin' Ted, L-Y-I-N apostrophe, right? Lyin' Ted.
So look, I will say this. You know I'm pro-life, OK, and with the exceptions. But -- but I am pro-life. I did the show because it's not a high-rated show. He's always been -- I mean, he has never treated me very badly, and frankly, he...
Well, perhaps, I mean, but he's always been, you know, fine.
And I -- I didn't think it was a big thing to do the show, and it was a hypothetical question. And as a hypothetical question, you give a hypothetical answer, and I didn't see the big, big huge deal. And I will tell you this, Sean, and I'll say it, and we can, you know, have this out. But so many people called me up and they thought that was a very strong answer and a very good -- Pastor Jeffress, who's a fantastic guy who's been on your show...
... a great man...
And -- well, he said -- but as a hypothetical question, that was a hypothetical answer that was not a wrong answer. And there were other people that wrote me letters, and I mean, by the hundreds, saying, that was a great answer to that question the way it was phrased.
Right.
Well, I do. I mean, I come with the three exceptions, and it's -- I think it's very important. But I will say that -- I mean, to me it's very important. I will say I watched Kasich being interviewed on a channel. I won't even say it. It didn't happen to be yours. He gave -- they were talking about abortion, and he gave such a bad answer -- it was so bad that at the end, he said, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I don't want to talk about it. If I ever did that, if I ever gave that answer, it would have been 10 times bigger headlines. And I said, I wonder -- oh, he's going to get killed. And I'm saying to myself, He's going to get killed for that answer. Nobody ever said anything. Nobody ever talks about it.
Well, whatever. Nobody -- nobody cares. I mean...
Crazy.
Amazing the way he shifted to that topic. I mean, he went from it to assault. And I said, Wait a minute. He's talking about -- look, I have a campaign manager who's a very -- he's a very good campaign manager. He's doing a great job, and all of this stuff. I mean...
Look, hopefully, I can say he has an OK candidate, right? He has an OK candidate, but he is -- I mean, we're number one by a lot. We're leading by millions of votes. Nobody ever talks about the votes. They -- you know -- by millions and millions of votes over Cruz and over Kasich.
Nobody ever talks about that. And we're also leading by -- you know, we just won Missouri. We -- Missouri just came in. But we're leading by close to 300 delegates. So we're leading by a lot. Corey is -- forget about campaign managers. He's doing great. But Corey's a fine person. He's a good person. He's got four beautiful children.
He's got a wife who's a terrific woman. He lives in New Hampshire, where I have a warm spot because that was my first victory. I mean, I love New Hampshire, right?
So -- so I read the statement made by this person, who I didn't know -- Michelle Fields. She's a reporter. And you have to find out, did she quit or did she get fired? Because, you know, I heard a story about what happened, that they -- they were pretty tough on her because of -- they didn't necessarily believe it. I'm not saying -- you're going to have to ask them.
I'm sure they'll eventually have to talk about it. But when I saw the tape -- I saw her -- first I saw her statement that she was practically thrown to the ground. I said, That's terrible! And I would have fired him on the spot if that actually took place. Then I have very good security in my place. I have beautiful security cameras all over for -- not for this.
By the way, not for this, but, you know...
So I have these great security cameras. I said, Do me a favor. Check those cameras. Maybe there's something. So I read her statement that she was thrown to the ground or almost thrown to the ground and gripped. Now I see her in the tape, right? First of all, she grabbed me or touched me or whatever, but she grabbed.
And you see me looking and -- and -- like this, right? Number one, she wasn't supposed to be there because we had just finished a -- a press conference. But here's the thing. I saw Corey -- and on your show, on various shows, they've had criminal defense lawyers there. Everybody says, What did he do? He didn't do anything.
How can I fire a man and ruin a man's life -- and most of you have seen the tape -- I mean, if anything...
I'll tell you, if anything -- and -- and I say this -- and you know, the easiest thing would have been -- it's so sad -- if I would have fired him, it would have been so much easier. This would be -- I can't do that. I'm loyal to people. I'm loyal to the country. I'll be loyal to the people of the country!
I mean, when I -- when I saw -- and you know what I'm talking about because I've seen a lot of different shows. Not even yours. Yours too. But I've seen a lot of different shows where they have lawyers on, and they're showing the tape. And virtually every single one of them said, What did he do? It was almost that he was running interference.
Number one, she wasn't supposed to be there. She cut in front of Secret Service.
It was over. And it was a long press conference.
And she wasn't supposed to be asking me -- so that's not a big deal. That's a certain space that you have with Secret Service, not supposed to be there. And if you look at him, he basically ran interference. I mean, it's not like -- now, do I destroy a man's life?
Because you know, if I fired him, that would be the destruction of his life professionally, in my opinion. Do I do that? Then I guess she reported him to the police department. And I mean, he's got charges, and for what? And people are looking -- she grabbed me. She touched me. I looked down. You can see I'm pulling my arm, you know, as they run it slowly.
She's not supposed to be there. Now, maybe I should file charges against her for grabbing me or touching me.
You know, maybe I should file.
By the way, Jupiter, Florida, is a great place. I, I respect it so much.
But I want to tell you -- I want to tell you, I think it's a real black eye to justice and to criminal justice when somebody gets in trouble...
And I always say thank goodness we had that tape because I can imagine -- you know, when she saw that tape, all of a sudden, the story sort of changed a little bit. It wasn't -- remember, you have to look at her first statement -- pulled to the ground or almost pulled to the ground. And it was, like, pretty vicious-sounding.
And then I saw the tape. So I think people should look at that. I think it's a great injustice.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
From June 16th.
Well -- what? What? You wait. What was that.
. No, I've learned there's great -- and I have to say this, and you're a total professional and there are others -- but I've learned there's tremendous dishonesty in the media.
Tremendous dishonesty.
Beyond anything -- beyond anything I've ever witnessed. Beyond anything I've ever witnessed. For instance, I talk about NATO, and I give this long -- I understand. You know, I get it. I get how it is. I said it's obsolete, and two, three days later, people say, Wow, that was really something. I said that we're spending too much money.
We're taking care of all the freeloaders. You know, we have 28 countries in there. We're taking care of a vast preponderance. But they're not paying. And they're really not paying because nobody's asking them to pay, in my opinion. You know I have an instinct for this stuff. They should pay. But it's really -- you know, we need something for terrorism.
That was set up I think 68 years ago or so for the Soviet Union. Well, the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. Russia's plenty tough. But here's the one thing. They cover my answer so inaccurately. And it's unbelievable. And every time I give a speech, I get a standing ovation on NATO and many other things.
But the press takes about 3 percent of what I say, and they disguise it to make it look as bad as possible. So you know, I -- very, very dishonest.
Well, the meeting was fine. We had a short meeting, probably half an hour. And he was there with his staff. And he's a really nice guy. I've always gotten along. But I just said I wanted to be treated fairly. I mean, I'm getting far more votes than anybody. In Louisiana, I won the state, and I find out I have less delegates than a guy that I beat quite easily.
And it doesn't -- and you say, What's going on? Now, in all fairness, we're way ahead in delegates, but why would somebody that loses have more delegates? They say, Well, there's this way, and -- I say, Wait a minute. I don't care about ways. I won the state. I'm not supposed to have less delegates than a guy I beat.
It doesn't work that way!
Yes.
Stop with the news. We'll go over.
First of all, Romney is -- lost so badly. He was -- it was one of the great defeats in the history of presidential politics. And for this guy to be talking -- and he knows how I felt. And I said, Hey, look, he's a choke artist. He choked with President Obama. And that's not presidential to say, but I'll say it anyway.
I have to say -- I always say -- I want to say it until I win. Then I promise I'll get presidential, OK.
But Romney is nothing but a choke artist. And I don't want his endorsement. You know, if I win this, I don't want -- I need his endorsement because...
Yes.
Millions and millions of people that are out there voting, and I have people -- it's the biggest story in politics today. The Republican Party, I hate to say it because it's, you know, whatever -- because I'm running, because they want to see America be great again, et cetera, et cetera, all the things we're going to do. The Republican Party is getting millions of votes more than it did four years ago.
Now, it's getting millions of votes more than it ever has!
And in all fairness, the Republican Party never had that image. It was like sort of tired, tired, exhausted, tired. And now, all of a sudden, you go to South Carolina, you go to New Hampshire, you go to different -- Nevada -- and a woman working in Nevada said, You know what? And she said this on television.
I'm watching television. She said, I've been in here for 25 years. They'd have, like, three people in this room. Now they had a line that was going back six blocks, five deep. And she said, I've never seen anything like this.
And that's every single thing. So -- so...
... the Republican should...
But you -- look at you. I mean, you were supposed to have just a little audience, and now they have to open up all the decks.
There's something amazing happening.
There's something...
Well, let me tell you what's unfair. I was always very good...
We won't let them, right.
Let me tell you, I was always very good...
Thank you. Wow, that's very nice.
Well, we have -- we have millions...
Thank you. We have millions -- we have millions of people. We're not talking about small. You know, like, as an example, above Cruz. And in all fairness to Cruz, at least he's going through with this process, and it's not an easy process.
But over -- over Ted Cruz, I have millions of additional votes, not only delegates, but millions of additional votes. I think it's really hard to do it. But I was always very good with mathematics, OK? So here's the problem we have, and that anybody in my position would have. I won, as you saw, many states.
I think I have what, 22, 23 states? We won a lot of states, all right, more -- by far much more...
... much more than anybody else. OK, so -- but the problem is those first states, we had 17 people running. So you could win a state -- you get 24, 25 percent, you'd win a state. But with all of those people -- you had governors -- you had people of great achievement. I mean, you had Ben Carson, who's a fantastic guy, but -- great achievement.
He endorsed me. Ben endorsed me. And you had Chris Christie, who endorsed me. But you had people of great achievement. You had governors, senators, et cetera, OK? And they all had 2 percent, 3 percent, 5 percent. We had 17 people! So it's impossible to get to that threshold in those early states. Even now, we still have Kasich.
Now, here's the problem with Kasich. First of all, I happen to think he takes votes away from me, moreso than Cruz. But...
But Sean -- Sean, he's 1 for 31, OK? Thank you. He's won -- it's not fair.
No, I think it's more. It's probably 33, if you add on the islands and everything else. But he's one for 31, probably 33. And if I spent two days more in Ohio, I would have won that, too. We did great in Ohio. I would have won Ohio.
And you know why I didn't do it? Because I wanted to be sure that I won Florida. We won Florida big. But I would have won Ohio. But the point is this. So we have all these people -- we have all these people, and it's very hard therefore to get the 50 percent plus one when you go -- despite that, I think we're going to do it. I'll tell you what, if we can win Wisconsin, and we are doing great, we're going to do it pretty easily.
Very boring. I'll be very boring.
No, he'll be so -- he'll have Trump on, and he'll say, That was the most boring interview I've ever done. No more Trump. No, I understand. You know what Melania says, what Ivanka -- Ivanka's the same...
I do, but I want to finish the job. You know, look...
I do. You know, in the last debate -- the last debate -- and Drudge is an amazing guy, by the way. But Drudge has a poll -- right? He really is. People don't know what an amazing guy. But Drudge has a poll, and Time magazine and all these -- you know there's, like, seven or eight of them, on-line polls after the debates.
I've won every single poll of every single debate. In other words, who won the debates. You know that.
Now, so they told me on the final debate, Be presidential. Don't hit back. Don't -- and I tried it. And I succeeded. I was so proud of myself.
But it was also -- by the way, I did good in the poll, but it was also the most boring debate of all, you have to say.
Right.
OK, we can do it fast. We have to bring our jobs back and we have to stop jobs from leaving. Every day, you read about companies...
Sean, right, every day, we're reading about companies, great companies -- Pfizer, great pharmaceutical companies -- moving to Ireland. A lot of companies are moving to Mexico. I mean, Mexico's like a China, a little smaller version. We're losing so many -- but we're going to build a wall. Who's going to pay for the wall?
We're going to build a wall, believe me. We're building the wall. You know, with Mexico, we have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year.
Oh, China, $505 billion. And we're going to stop all that. And we have the greatest -- you know many of them, and you know they're friends of mine, and have endorsed me. Carl Icahn...
We're going to get the greatest negotiators and...
Oh, it's going to be so good. It's -- we're losing, we're losing all of our jobs, folks. We're losing so much. And what they do is the monetary manipulation. They devalue their currencies to such an extent. And they're grand masters. And we have people in Washington, they don't even know what's happening to us. You take a look at Komatsu in Japan, they make tractors.
Look what they're doing to Caterpillar. So many companies are just absolutely --
If I'm not elected. If I'm not elected.
No, no, no. No, I, I did make the statement, I did make the statement, because we're in a massive bubble. We have money that's the cheapest money we've ever had yet. Nobody can borrow it unless you're very rich. I mean, if I want to borrow money, I can borrow all the money I want to borrow. But if you aren't really rich, you can't borrow money.
So did you ever hear of cheap money that nobody can get? We're sitting on a bubble. The stock market is very inflated and very -- now, we have to straighten out our country. We are $19 trillion in debt. The budget -- -- you know they talk about Paul Ryan. Well, I like Paul Ryan personally. No, but this omnibus budget from three months ago that they passed is a disaster.
It gives Obama the money to bring people in from Syria. It gives him the money to bring the illegal immigrants in. It gives him money for Obamacare, which has to be repealed and replaced.
No, no, but it will take fairly quickly, and it can be done.
You know, he likes the penny plan. And you know, the penny plan, you know it sounds simple. It's actually very good. And you can do more than a penny, by the way. But it will take place and it will go relatively quickly. But what we have to start doing again, immediately, we have to make better trade deals.
I'll be able to that very -- that's what I do, make better trade deals. We have to make sure that these countries -- you know, we protect Japan, we protect Saudi Arabia, we protect Germany, we protect -- we're like the policemen to the world. We protect everybody. When they say that our military budget is many times that of any other country, of course it is. We're protecting everybody.
So we have to renegotiate deals. I don't mind protecting countries, but we have to get paid a fair amount of money for it.
Well, it has got to be loosened up. It has got to be loosened up. You know, we take our coal, because I'm somebody that believes in clean coal. I believe in all forms of energy. I think it's fine.
Including --
Including the newer stuff that I use, solar, et cetera, et cetera. But it's not working. It's so expensive. It's just not working. And it will get better and better with time. But we can't rely on that. I mean, solar is wonderful and great, but, you know, there's a 32 -- year payback. Who wants a 32 -- year payback?
Same thing with wind. Wind is a horrible thing in terms of vision, what it looks like. And it has a place in certain areas, it has a place. As you know, in California, it's killing all the eagles.
Well, no -- yes, but they don't want it.
It's amazing. They all want wind until you're going to put it next to their house, and then all of a sudden it's like, we don't want the wind.
But look, it all has a place. We -- coal, we have in West Virginia, in Ohio, I mean, look at what has happened to Ohio. They have clean coal now. We send our coal -- you know what, we send our coal. We don't do much coal anymore. The miners are devastated. That industry is -- we send it --
Well, we don't have too much of a budget, right.
By the way -- just a thought though. We send our coal to China. We send our coal to China. We can't use it. We're not allowed to use it practically, it's so restrictive. But we send our coal to China. It's so sad.
I am totally in favor. You know, nuclear had a big setback when they had the problem in Japan. They were all set to go. But new nuclear is really -- and very, very inexpensive. You look at certain countries like France, not that I want to copy France --
But they've got a vast majority of their energy is from nuclear.
Oh absolutely. First of all --
First of all, first of all, we want to bring education back to Wisconsin, right? Right?
So we end Common Core, and Department of Education can -- I mean, the Department of Education is massive and it can be largely eliminated. Now you maybe want to have a little bit of, you know, tentacles out there, make sure everything -- but largely we can eliminate the Department of Education. Department of environmental, I mean, the DEP is killing us environmentally.
It's just killing our businesses. That can be state.
Well, you know, by the way, speaking of Cuba, and I'm not saying we shouldn't do something eventually, but we have to do a great deal as opposed to the deal we're doing. But worst, when he landed in Air Force One and there was nobody to greet him. To me, can you imagine.
And I said, you know, Air Force One has been around for a while. I said, that may be the first time in the history of Air Force One that the president of the United States lands in a country and there's nobody to great him. So it's a total lack of respect. He should have left immediately. He should have left, should have left the baseball game.
The wave was not a good thing, especially in light of what we're going through.
But he should have left immediately and come back home to Washington where the president belongs at a time like that.
Who, by the way, and this is interesting, yesterday for the first time he is now saying Iran, not so happy with Iran. He's not so happy with the deal. I've been telling him that for two years it's not going to work out. And, you know, it's interesting. Hey, I wrote a book in 2000, I talked about Osama bin Laden in the book, two years before the World Trade Center got knocked down.
And then I talked about Brussels recently. And ""The New York Times"" put this big story in that Donald Trump -- I said Brussels is a hellhole. Now, I know that because it's a big financial capital and friends of mine are very much involved with Brussels, and they tell me what's going on. And ""The New York Times"" came up and they wrote a vicious story about me talking so badly about Brussels.
And then you had this horrible attack. And now everybody is saying he was right. I know what I'm doing. I mean, I know what I'm doing.
Well, you know, I haven't really. I just haven't wanted to give it yet. I sort of do but I want to knock off the next two people, and then I can focus on Hillary.
Oh, it's going to be great.
But I will say this, and I think -- I think a lot of people will confirm it. Nobody has more respect for women than I do, that I can tell you. Nobody.
Well, it seems unfair to have to do so, probably there will be some of that. It seems unfair. She's playing that card very heavily. Now she played the card two months ago, and the only time I really hit her was two months ago. And Bernie got all the credit, because she went down and all of a sudden he started doing well.
You know, when I did that two months she went right down. I think I'm going to have to take a little credit for what's happening with Bernie because he has won, what, the last six in a row.
And I'll tell you, Wisconsin is going to be very interesting. I understand he's leading in Wisconsin. It's going to be an interesting -- so I don't know what's going to happen. I mean, I can't say. But I look at what's happening. You take a look at Libya. That was her baby. And a friend of mine who's very well-versed in what's going on, Libya had great oil, very, very pure, very beautiful oil.
You know who has got that oil now? ISIS. ISIS has that oil. They've taken that oil. So you had Benghazi. You had the ambassador and the others, wonderful people, being absolutely and brutally killed, nobody talks about the viciousness of those killings. They were vicious. And remember the famous phone call, when you get the --
Well, she wasn't there to answer the call. I mean, she wasn't there.
I do. I have a strategy but --
It's too early. I don't even know if she's going to be the nominee. It's too early to even --
It says better than anything when he won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism.""
And with -- you saw what happened yesterday with the French where he had the word --
It had to happen. He said it was a technical mistake. This is what I mean. Those two words or three words were edited out. It was a technical mistake. To think, I mean --
No, well, it's a lie.
OK. Well, we just lost a great one. And who would have thought this could have happened. And I think it's one of the probably, maybe -- well, look, defense is always most important. But one of the most important things going on right now is who are the justices going to be, because there could be as many -- could actually be as many as five.
So it's going to change. I would go with a very conservative person. I would go --
I would go prolife. I would go with great intellect and somebody that would be like Scalia, worthy of tremendous admiration and respect. It's so important.
I think it's fine. You know, I took heat from these people that don't get it. When Russia started bombing ISIS and then said, we should be doing that, you know, these Lindsey Grahams or these characters that don't know what they're doing.
They've been fighting -- you know, he said, I've been doing this for many years. That's why we keep fighting. We should knock them out quickly.
But that's why we're losing, exactly. Said very well. The fact is, we have to knock ISIS out so fast. And if Russia, you know, Putin has said very nice things about me. So people said -- actually during one of the debates, one of the people said, you should tell him to take that away. I said, I'm not going to take it away.
He called me a genius, actually, thought that was very nice. But you know what, you know what --
-- if Russia wants to help us, if Russia wants to drop bombs all the hell over ISIS, who are cutting people's heads off and drowning people, that's OK with me.
",Interview: Sean Hannity Interviews Donald Trump on Fox News' Hannity,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-hannity-fox-april-4-2016
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-10-17,"Thank you very much. I just want to make an initial comment that the stock market just hit an all-time record high. It broke, for the first time ever, 23,000. So we're very happy about that. I hope that Greece is going to be doing the same thing very soon.
But I'm honored to welcome Prime Minister Tsipras of Greece, and he's a special man who's done a very special job. We're grateful to the Prime Minister and to his entire delegation for visiting us today at the White House.
Greece is a cradle of Western civilization -- so true -- of democracy, literature, philosophy, science, and so much else. America looks on that glorious heritage with wonder and with awe. You do indeed have a tremendous heritage, Mr. Prime Minister.
Perhaps for this reason, America's friendship with the Greek people has been long and enduring. Thomas Jefferson wrote at the dawn of the modern Greek state that ""no people sympathize more"""" with Greek patriots and """"none offer more sincere and ardent prayers to heaven for their success"""" than the American people.""
Jefferson's words are true to this day. Mr. Prime Minister, I'm proud to report that this past March, we celebrated Greek Independence Day right here at the White House. And that was great.
America and Greece draw on this common history and heritage and on our peoples' abiding commitment to freedom and sovereignty in working together on great challenges and opportunities now before us. There are tremendous opportunities before us in so many different ways.
The Prime Minister and I have just concluded a very productive discussion on the cooperation between our two countries, including on matters of defense, energy, commerce, and trade.
I want to thank the Prime Minister and the Greek people for serving as gracious hosts to our U.S. naval forces at Souda Bay. I also commend Greece for being one of the few NATO countries currently spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.
My administration has also informed Congress of a potential sale to Greece to upgrade its F-16 aircraft. This agreement to strengthen the Hellenic Air Force is worth up to $2.4 billion and would generate thousands of American jobs.
We also are making great strides in our economic cooperation. The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation. I have encouraged the Prime Minister in his continued implementation of reform and reform programs, and I have totally reaffirmed our support for a responsible debt-relief plan.
A strong and flourishing Greece provides immense opportunity for American trade, investment, and job creation. I thank the Prime Minister, his predecessors, and the Greek people for their efforts to return stability and prosperity to Greece.
On energy, we appreciate Greek contributions to European energy security through its support of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, the Greece-Bulgaria Interconnector, and liquefied natural gas facilities that are capable of transporting diverse sources of energy to Europe, including potential liquefied natural gas exports from the United States, of which that particular route -- and business is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, as you know.
These initiatives make both our people safer and create good jobs for our hardworking citizens.
Finally, I am also very proud that the United States will be the ""Honored Country"""" at next year's International Fair in Greece. This historic business and trade exhibition will showcase American technology
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you again for being here today and for your partnership in addressing critical issues facing our countries. I look forward to having many productive discussions with you, and to having a very close and warm cooperation on a wide range of shared objectives.
We will build upon our foundation of shared history and shared values to pursue a future of security, prosperity, and peace for both your nation and ours. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much.
We'll take a few questions. John, go ahead, please.
Thank you.
It's a nice place.
Well, if you look at insurance companies and you take a good, strong look at the numbers, you'll see, since the formation of Obamacare, they're up 400 percent, 450 percent, 250 percent, 300 percent. They've made a fortune, the insurance companies.
So when I knocked out the hundreds of millions of dollars a month being paid back to the insurance companies by politicians, I must tell you, that wanted me to continue to pay this, I said I'm not going to do it. This is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets, to raise up their stock prices. And they've had a record run. They've had an incredible run, and it's not appropriate.
Obamacare is a disaster. It's virtually dead. As far as I'm concerned, it really is dead and I predicted that a long time ago. It's a concept that doesn't work. And we are very close.
We feel we have the votes, and as soon as we're finished with taxes, John -- we really feel we have the votes to get block grants into the states, where the states can much better manage this money and much better take care of the people, rather than the federal government. The state block grants -- we'll do massive block grants into the various states so that the states can run the program.
So we feel we have the votes. We're going to be doing that after the taxes. In the meantime, we're involved with a budget and then after the budget -- hopefully that gets approved -- and after the budget, assuming we have the support of all the Republicans -- because we'll have no support from the Democrats or almost no support, because they've really become just obstructionists.
They have no good policies, and frankly, they're not good politicians but they're very good obstructionists. And that's what they do well -- obstruct.
The number of nominees that I have approved by the Democrats are about half of what President Obama had. And when you look at that -- and you can look at judicial appointments, look how slow that's going. I'll have 145 ultimately, which is a tremendous number.
We'll have 17 court of appeals appointments. But they're not getting approved. They're being slow-walked by Schumer and the group of Democrats that really -- it's really disgraceful. Even people that they know they're going to approve, they take it right out to the end. They use every single minute, and I think it's a very disgraceful situation.
But Obamacare is everything but dead. The people aren't going to take it. They're not going to take it. Alaska, they had over 200 percent increase. In Arizona, they were 116 percent -- and I hear going up even higher. And the people aren't going to take that any longer.
So I think we're in great shape. I think we have the votes. And we'll be doing that right after the largest tax cuts in the history of our country are approved, hopefully sometime in the very near future.
Yeah, essentially that would be the plan. Yes, block grants.
I wish I knew that before my speech.
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I might just add that a number of countries were a little bit nervous at the beginning. And I have very good relationships with the leaders of virtually every country I've dealt with. But the reason they were concerned was because I will not allow our country, the United States of America, to be taken advantage of by so many other countries all over the world.
If you look at our trade deficits -- massive trade deficits with virtually every country. If you look at our jobs moving out to certain countries, and the companies are leaving and they're firing the people, and the product is made elsewhere, and then it's sold back into the United States. I'm not going to be allowing that.
So I can understand how certain countries and the leaders of certain countries may feel. But we're just not going to allow the United States to be taken advantage of by other countries anymore. And there's nothing we can do about that. Thank you. Okay, you have a question.
I can say that we have a great confidence in Greece. I think it's a land of tremendous potential. I know many people are looking to invest in Greece. A lot of the problems are behind it. They've had some very good leadership. They've really made done a lot of -- they've made a lot of difficult decisions.
We are helping, as you know, with a massive renovation of their air force and also of airplanes, generally, going to Greece.
They're looking at buying additional planes from Boeing. And we are helping -- we're very much involved with Greece and with helping Greece get back on its feet. We have a tremendous Greek population in this country, people whose heritage is Greece. And we love that country, special country, one of the most beautiful countries in the world. So I think it's got great potential, and we are helping it along.
Okay. Jennifer, you want to go?
Sure.
I would say within those five you'll probably get the answer. And I'll be making this decision over the next fairly short period of time.
Honestly, I like them all.
I do. I have a great respect for all of them. But I'll make a decision over the next very short period of time.
Sure.
Yes, we have been involved. And this is a short-term deal because we think, ultimately, block grants going to the states is going to be the answer. That's a very good solution. We think it's going to not only save money but give people much better healthcare with a very, very much smaller premium spike -- and you look at what has gone on with that -- also, much lower deductibles so they can use it.
Lamar has been working very, very hard with the Democratic -- his colleagues on the other side, and Patty Murray is one of them, in particular. And they're coming up and they're fairly close to a short-term solution.
The solution will be for about a year or two years, and it will get us over this intermediate hump because we have -- as you probably know, we have -- we either have the votes or we are very close to having the votes. And we will get the votes for having, really, the potential of having great healthcare in our country.
So they are indeed working, but it is a short-term solution so that we don't have this very dangerous little period -- including dangerous periods for insurance companies, by the way. For a period of one year, two years, we will have a very good solution. But we're going to have a great solution, ultimately, for healthcare. And they are working together and I know very much what they're doing.
Well, I'd just start by saying that I think it has a great role in stability in the area. We have a feeling that it will get stronger and stronger. Very stable people. It's got the potential to be -- once it gets over this tremendous financial hurdle that it's in the process of working out, we think that there will be great stability in Greece, and militarily and in every way we look at it as very important, and very important to the United States.
We have great confidence in Greece as a nation. We have great confidence in what they're doing relative to their military, because I know they have plans to do some terrific things. And we know they will be an ally for many, many years to come.
You know, they've always been a very reliable ally, and we've always been very reliable to them. So we look forward to that for many years. We're going to be friends for many, many years, and stability is very important. And we look upon that, with respect to Greece, as being a key. Thank you.
Well, I want to thank everybody. And the Prime Minister came out here and he said, this is so beautiful. I said, this is the Rose Garden. And I think even the media likes the Rose Garden. Mr. Prime Minister, it's been a great honor having you, and we look forward to many, many years of friendship, working together. And keep up the good work. Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-05-23,"Hello, folks.
All you have to do is look at the basics and you'll see. It looks like a very serious event. But we'll find out. When they look at the documents, I think people are going to see a lot of bad things happened. I hope it's not so, because if it is, there's never been anything like it in the history of our country. I hope -- I mean, if you look at Clapper, he sort of admitted that they had spies in the campaign, yesterday, inadvertently. But I hope it's not true. But it looks like it is.
I think James Comey has got a lot of problems. If you look at what at he did, if you look at all of the lies -- the tremendous lies -- if you look at all that's going on, I think James Comey has got a lot of problems.
Now, at some point they have an IG report, and then let's see what James Comey has to say. But I assume he's covered in the IG report. But if you look at what he said -- all of the lies, all of the fiction -- I think he's got a lot of problems.
Well, I don’t want to get into yet, but I will tell you --
-- after we look at the proof -- would he know? I would certainly hope not. But I think it's going to be pretty obvious after a while. We're going now to talk about MS-13 with the great police officers. We're going out to Long Island. I don’t know, are yo
No, no. No, no. We're not undercutting. We're cleaning everything up. This was a terrible situation. What we're doing is we're cleaning everything up. It's so important. What I'm doing is a service to this country. And I did a great service to this country by firing James Comey and --
Excuse me. A lot of people have said it. And you go into the FBI, and a lot of those great people working in the FBI, they will tell you, I did a great service to our country by firing James Comey.
I want them all to get together and I want them -- because everybody wants this solved. But a lot of bad things have happened. We now call it Spygate. You're calling it Spygate. A lot of bad things have happened. I want them all to get together. They'll sit in a room. Hopefully they'll be able to work it out among themselves.
NAFTA? Excuse me, NAFTA?
I think your autoworkers and your auto companies in this country are going to be very happy with what's going to happen. You'll be seeing very soon what I'm talking about. NAFTA is very difficult. Mexico has been very difficult to deal with. Canada has been very difficult to deal with. They have been taking advantage of the United States for a long time. I am not happy with their requests.
But I will tell you, in the end, we win. We will win, and we'll win big. We'll get along with Mexico; we'll get along with Canada. But I will tell you, they have been very difficult to deal with. They're very spoiled -- because nobody has done this. But I will tell you that what they ask for is not fair. Our autoworkers are going to be extremely happy.
Say it? What?
Well, we're going to see what happens. On Singapore, we're going to see. And it could happen. It could very well happen. But whatever it is, it is. We will know next week about Singapore. And if we go, I think it will be a great thing for North Korea.
I can't hear you, John.
Someday a date will happen. It could very well be June 12th. Someday a date will absolutely happen. It could very well be June 12th. We'll see. We'll know next week.
Well, they're going to all be in the room tomorrow. We're going to see what happens. What I want is I want total transparency.
Wait. You have to have transparency.
Even they probably want transparency, because this issue supersedes a party. This supersedes Republicans and Democrats. So what I want from Rod, from the FBI, from everybody -- we want transparency. And you know what? I think in their own way they are obstructionists, but even the Democrats, I really believe, on this issue -- it supersedes -- I think they want transparency too.

Whereas the President of the United States is by the Constitution made Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, as well as chief civil executive officer of the United States, and is bound by solemn oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and
Whereas the rebellion which has been waged by a portion of the people of the United States against the properly constituted authorities of the Government thereof in the most violent and revolting form, but whose organized and armed forces have now been almost entirely overcome, has in its revolutionary progress deprived the people of the State of North Carolina of all civil government; and
Whereas it becomes necessary and proper to carry out and enforce the obligations of the United States to the people of North Carolina in securing them in the enjoyment of a republican form of government:
Now, therefore, in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed upon me by the Constitution of the United States and for the purpose of enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a State government whereby justice may be established, domestic tranquillity insured, and loyal citizens protected in all their rights of life, liberty, and property, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, do hereby appoint William W. Holden provisional governor of the State of North Carolina, whose duty it shall be, at the earliest practicable period, to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening a convention composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the people of said State who are loyal to the United States, and no others, for the purpose of altering or amending the constitution thereof, and with authority to exercise within the limits of said State all the powers necessary. and proper to enable such loyal people of the State of North Carolina to restore said State to its constitutional relations to the Federal Government and to present such a republican form of State government as will entitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor and its people to protection by the United States against invasion, insurrection, and domestic violence: Provided, That in any election that may be hereafter held for choosing delegates to any State convention as aforesaid no person shall be qualified as an elector or shall be eligible as a member of such convention unless he shall have previously taken and subscribed the oath of amnesty as set forth in the President's proclamation of May 29, A.

And I do hereby direct--
First. That the military commander of the department and all officers and persons in the military and naval service aid and assist the said provisional governor in carrying into effect this proclamation; and they are enjoined to abstain from in any way hindering, impeding, or discouraging the loyal people from the organization of a State government as herein authorized.
Second. That the Secretary of State proceed to put in force all laws of the United States the administration whereof belongs to the State Department applicable to the geographical limits aforesaid.
Third.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-07-19,"Hello everyone. That is a very good group, I will tell you. I'm looking at these people -- I see them on the cover of all the magazines every week, every month. Hi, Fred.
That's great.
Well, thank you, Ivanka, very much, and for your incredible leadership of the White House workforce initiative. You really have done an incredible job, and you've worked so hard. And I want to just tell you, we're all proud of you. Everyone here is proud of you, especially these folks back here because that's the future. So I want to thank you, honey.
I'm thrilled and honored to be here today to launch the National Council for the American Worker. Joining us for the announcement is Secretary Wilbur Ross -- Secretary -- good; Secretary Alex Acosta; Betsy DeVos -- everybody knows, education; Acting Secretary Peter O'Rourke -- Peter, great job you're doing; Director Mulvaney, who has worked so hard -- those budgets, but they're coming along, right? Right, Mick?
Linda McMahon -- Administrator, Small Business. Thank you Linda. Jared -- fantastic job. Chris -- incredible. What a group; this group. Nobody knows Kellyanne -- nobody knows. Fantastic job, Andrew. Thank you. Please stand up. Thank you.
I want to thank you, also -- we have some very special people here. House Education and Workforce Chairwoman -- see, now we say ""chairwoman,"" right? We like it better. Virginia Foxx. Virginia. And we have -- thanks, Virginia, great job -- Representatives Rick Allen, Jaime Herrera Beutler. Thank you. Thank you. Sean Duffy. Sean? Sean? My friend.
We have some very special other folks here, in a very high administrative capacity. We have a favorite of mine: Governor Scott Walker. What a job he's done. And Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale. Matt, great. I hear you're doing good, Matt.
We're really especially grateful to be joined today by the top CEOs, union leaders, trade associations, and educators from all around the country. These are the biggest. These are the best. These are the most talented.
Among those -- and I'm going to be introducing them and going around the table with them as they sign their pledge -- but we have a friend of mine for a long time -- the, really, founder and creator -- and I heard he did a report at his school, and he got low marks because they said it couldn't work, and he ended up getting very high marks because it's a company called FedEx.
Is that a correct story? Pretty correct, right? That professor didn't know what happened. Fred Smith. Thank you, Fred. Huh?
Yeah. Home Depot CEO -- doing a fantastic job -- Craig Menear. Craig. Thank you, Craig. Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson. And how's the F-35 doing? Right on time? Right.
Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy. Tom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Tom.
And we're going to introduce everybody in a little while. I also want to recognize Dan England, chairman of the American Trucking Association, along with Johnny Taylor, president of the Society for Human Resource Management. They've been fantastic, and really worked hard with us.
Everyone here today is united by the same goal: to train, recruit, hire American workers. Thanks to our tremendous economic successes -- and we've had a lot of them. And we've never had -- and I have to tell you, as a country, we have never been more successful than we are, exactly, right now, today. The numbers coming out are beyond what anyone ever thought possible.
And so there's never been a better time to hire and grow in America. We've created 3.7 million jobs since the election. In the month of June alone, we grew the workforce by more than 600,000 workers. There's no way -- no way that could happen. Well, it's happened, and far more than we ever thought.
We're in the longest positive job growth streak in American history. African American unemployment has reached its lowest level in American history. Hispanic unemployment is at its lowest level in American history. Asian unemployment has reached its lowest level in American history.
Women's unemployment -- oh, this is too bad, Marillyn -- this is very sad -- has reached its lowest level in only 65 years. But within about two weeks, I think we'll be able to say ""in American history."" Because it's moving quickly. Okay? Sixty-five years, not so bad. Right.
Consumer and business confidence has reached its all-time highs -- the highest ever recorded. And 95 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. That's the highest number ever recorded. So a lot of good things are happening out there.
Every day, we are lifting our forgotten Americans off the sidelines, out of the margins, and back into the workforce. We are giving a second chance at life to the 620,000 former inmates who reenter society each year. There's nothing like a great, great jobs market to take care of that situation.
It's incredible what's happened with people that were in prison that, previous to this, could not get themselves a job. And now they're being hired, and people are loving them. It's been really incredible to see.
But to keep this momentum going, to continue this economic miracle -- and that's what it is, it's a miracle what's happened in the last years and a half -- we must invest in job training and vocational education. I mean, the fact is that companies are pouring back into our country -- companies that, frankly, left 10 and 20 years ago, and they're coming back. And we need people to work for those companies. We need talented people. We need people with training.
That's why, in a few moments, I will be signing an executive order to establish the National Council for the American Worker. That's a first. This Council will be made up of top officials across the government. We're also establishing an outside advisory board of industry leaders and experts, which we will announce in the coming weeks. Very shortly. A lot of people want to be on that board very badly; I have some great people going on that board.
Together, their task will be to develop a national workforce and strategy to equip Americans of all ages and at all stages of their career with the skills they need to thrive in the modern economy. Whether it’s a high school student looking to land their first job -- first job ever.
They've got a lot of enthusiasm, and they lose that enthusiasm when they don't land that job, but now they're all landing jobs. Or a late-career worker who wants to learn a new trade, we want every American to have the chance to earn a great living doing a great job that they love, where they wake up in the morning and they can't get to work fast enough. A lot of these people know that feeling. That's why they're in the position they're in.
In that spirit, I'm proud to announce an exciting new challenge and the beginning of a new national movement. We're asking businesses and organizations across the country to sign our new pledge to America’s workers.
Today, 23 companies and associations are pledging to expand apprenticeships. That's an interesting word for me to be saying. Right? ""The Apprentice. That was a good experience, I will tell you that. Ivanka, I never associated -- but here we are. Can't get away from that word. That's a great word. For on the job training and vocational education.
They will sign the Pledge, committing to train and re-train more than 3.8 million American students and workers for new jobs and rewarding careers.
This is only day one, and we far exceeded our initial goal of 500,000 students and workers. We thought it was going to be 500,000, and it's close to 4 million. And by the time the day ends, it will probably be well over 4 million.
In the days and months ahead, we hope that hundreds of companies and organizations will join us in this effort. I want to thank all of the wonderful companies and associations who are about to sign the Pledge, and we're about to introduce. I applaud your civic leadership. It's incredible. I know so many of you. I know how committed you are. You're great people. And your commitment to training and recruiting American workers.
Also here with us today are American workers who know firsthand how job training transforms their lives. I’d like to invite a couple of them to speak.
Brian -- Brianna -- where is Brianna? Brianna, come on over here. Brianna DeAngelo, from Greenwood, Indiana is an apprentice for Gaylor Electric. Good company? Better say yes.
Please, say a few words, Brianna. Thanks.
Very nice. Also here today is Johnita McNair from Orlando, Florida, who is completing the American Hotel and Lodging Association’s Apprenticeship for managers. And they're really lot of talented people coming out of that program. Please, Johnita.
Thank you. Great job. That's great. I'd also like to ask Carl Greene to come up. He is a truck driver and a military veteran. And he's doing really well. Carl.
Thank you, Carl. And thank you to everybody. You've really been very special. We know every one of you and the great job you've done. Thank you all very much. Fantastic. Great careers.
America is blessed with the greatest workers anywhere in the world. And today we are taking historic steps to ensure that every American has the chance to realize their full-time potential.
By signing the Pledge to America’s Workers, these great companies -- and they are great; these are the greatest in the world -- are affirming their commitment to train American workers for American jobs, because America’s strength, America's heart, and America's soul is found in our people. More than anything else, it's in our people. It is their love, their pride, and their patriotism that makes this magnificent land our beloved home.
And together, with the help of everyone in this room, we will truly make America greater than ever before. It's what's happening. Greater than ever before. And I think it's happening faster than anyone ever thought. It's moving rapidly. We have numbers coming out -- and past and present, and hopefully future -- that are far beyond anybody's wildest expectations. And I think, frankly, you haven’t seen anything yet.
So I will now sign the executive order. And then I'm going to go around and say hello to these incredible people. And they're going to be giving the name of their company, and many of you know them already, and they're going to be signing -- taking on almost 4 million people. That's very exciting. So thank you all very much.
I'm going to sign the executive order.
Let's go over here. Go ahead, Bob.
Thank you very much, Bob. Thank you.
Sign that, Bob. Sign it.
All right, let's sign it.
I don’t want anyone sneaking out.
There we have it.
Go ahead.
All right. On behalf of the American Hotel and Lodging Association and our 26,000 members, and in addition to our management track apprenticeship program, we are announcing 130,000 new opportunities with scholarships, certifications, at a cost-free college program for the great women and men of hospitality.
That is a big number. Thank you, Katherine. Thank you very much. Thank you, Katherine. Thank you very much.
That's right.
Wow. That's big stuff. Thank you, Dan. Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
That is fantastic. And you'll do it. You'll do it. I know you will, Greg. Thank you. Thank you.
That's great. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. That's beautiful. Hello, Fred.
This is some man right here, I'll tell you.
That's great. Thank you, Fred. Thank you.
Scott Walker. You know who this is, right? He's building the most incredible place you've ever seen in Wisconsin. Right, Scott? I just left. That's got to be -- tell us about that for a second. Go ahead.
That's great. Fantastic. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Fantastic.
Well, give my regards. You know that. Say hello.
Wow, that's fantastic. You're doing great. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Michael.
Thank you, Marillyn. And you've done a fantastic job. Thank you, Marillyn. Hey, Fred, she makes a plane you can't see; it's stealth. I hope you can't see it, at least. Right? Great job. Thank you very much.
Whoa, that's fantastic.
Very good. You're right. They're great. They're great. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Right. Good.
That's fantastic. Thank you very much.
That is great. Thank you. Thank you.
I know you. It's going to be even more.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Great. I know the union well.
Friend. He's my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Fantastic. Thank you very much.
Walmart. Wait until you hear this number, folks.
Thank you very much. That is fantastic. Thank you, Tom. So that's a big beginning. That's a much bigger beginning, Ivanka, than anyone thought possible. We're very proud of everybody in this room. You folks -- for so many years, I've known so many of you.
But that is really a great commitment. So we appreciate it. We're just getting started. We need people to be trained. We need people that are going to go out and really love their job, and that's what you're going to do. And those are great jobs. Marillyn, those are great jobs.
Thank you all. Fred. Thank you, everybody. This is a big, big day for our country. There's never been anything done like this before. And you see the numbers, so we're going to need all of these people. And most importantly in the room, good luck to you. Good luck. Thank you. Good luck.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Hosts a Pledge to America's Workers Event,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-american-workers-pledge-july-19-2018
Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,2016-09-12,"It is reassuring to be here for such a distinguished audience. And an audience that is engaged in supporting an activity that is after all one of the most important, and of course one of the most idealistic, causes in which humanity can be engaged. I congratulate you all on what you’re doing.
I am going to try and wrap up for us as the host country today by saying how grateful I am to everybody who has spoken so far, to our co-hosts, to our colleagues from the UN, and of course to all those who have pledged to build on today’s important work, including in France in just a few weeks from now.
I know that you have also heard from those who’ve experienced the sharp end of conflict – both serving peacekeepers and our NGO colleagues doing important work in those countries afflicted by conflict. Hearing these voices is a reminder for us that the decisions we make today can have a real impact on the lives of people around the world.
The number of countries and international organisations in this room today shows how vital this subject is.
I think also today’s meeting has been a testament to how seriously the UK takes its role in international affairs, and its support for the UN in particular. The UK has always been steadfast in its commitment to work with our allies in the pursuit of global peace and security.
Our role at the UN is at the very heart of that international commitment. That’s why I was very glad to visit New York in my first week in this job and I’m very glad to be going back there in just a few days’ time with today’s communiqué in my hand to continue to champion the things we’ve agreed today.
Of course the UK’s commitment to peacekeeping does not begin or end with this Ministerial. We believe in peacekeeping and we will work with you to make it better. The UK is already a leading voice on peacekeeping reform in New York.
And New York is obviously not the only place where we are showing our support. As Michael, my colleague, has said earlier today we are putting more UK troops and police officers on the ground through our deployments in South Sudan and Somalia. And you will have heard that we are increasing that commitment by providing a Role 2 hospital in South Sudan. I’m pleased to see all these UK personnel serving alongside counterparts from a number of countries present in this room today.
We have achieved a lot and there have been a lot of exciting new pledges. A communiqué, signed by so many of you – and we hope many more of you will sign up later on – that sets out a blueprint for the future and a commitment to driving forward what we call the 3Ps of peacekeeping. And what are the 3Ps of peacekeeping. Pledges. Performance. The 3Ps of peacekeeping. And as John Lennon said, let’s give the 3Ps a chance.
Our pledges today will swell the ranks of peacekeepers. But we will not have fulfilled our task until the UN can choose the troops it sends into a conflict not just on the basis of who is available, but on what skills are best suited to the task.
We have set out our ambition to increase the number of women serving in our militaries. But we will not have achieved our task until women are fully represented in every aspect of peacekeeping. Until we see Gender Champions like the UK’s own General Messenger in New York and in every member state. Because I want peacekeeping to benefit from the indispensable skills that women bring to resolving conflict.
We have talked today, I know that Michael Fallon has talked earlier on, about instilling a culture of accountability for performance. Accountability to mission commanders. Accountability to the UN and the Security Council. And above all accountability to the people that missions are sent to serve and to protect. But we will not have achieved our task until we can demonstrate to those people that immediate and transparent action is being taken in instances of poor performance and that there has been a genuine attempt to understand why things went wrong.
To do that we need to make reform and to make the desire to do better part of UN peacekeeping’s DNA. We need to continue under the next Secretary-General the great work being done by Secretary-General Ban and his team.
To do that requires all of us to pull in the same direction – the UN, the Security Council and the troop and police contributing countries. Foreign and Defence Ministries. The different Departments and Agencies of the UN. The people in our capitals and the people around the world.
And we, the Member States, must bring the full weight of our political influence to bear on those who seek to fuel and foment conflict. Those who work against the ideals of peace that the UN stands for. We must support peacekeepers in the field with all of our tools, from sanctions, to embargoes to good old fashioned diplomacy. I can tell you now that the UK will always be a part of that collective effort. A staunch defender of the importance of the UN, of the power of diplomacy and of the future of peacekeeping.
If, in the coming months and years, we can continue to build on what we have agreed today – make the 3Ps a reality; stand alongside our peacekeepers as they protect civilians, help people hold free and fair elections, and deliver humanitarian aid – then we can truly hope to reduce conflict. And maybe one day, we will have less need to call on the brave men and women in blue helmets. But for now, we certainly do need them, so together let’s make sure that we have them in the right numbers, with the right skills, and the right equipment to do the job properly.
Thank you very much.
",2016 Speech on Peacekeeping,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/boris-johnson-2016-speech-on-peacekeeping/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-09-24,"Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with a very good friend of mine, President Moon of South Korea. We're having a very important set of discussions today, tomorrow, and the next day. We've been having them for quite some time since you first gained office. And you're doing a terrific job. And I think we're doing a terrific job together.
We've had terrific talks on trade. And we'll be signing, in a little while, a very important trade agreement with South Korea and the United States. And I think it's a very exciting event.
It was a long time in coming, and it's a basic redoing of the agreement that was done before, which was a very unfair agreement for the United States. And I think that President Moon and myself, we're very happy. It's great for South Korea. It's great for the United States. It's great for both.
We also talked, obviously, about North Korea, where we're making tremendous progress. Chairman Kim has been really very open and terrific, frankly. And I think he wants to see something happen. So we have done -- I think, mutually, we've done very well with respect to North Korea. And we'll be discussing that during the next couple of days. We'll be certainly discussing it now.
But I just want to say it's a great honor to have President Moon with us. And thank you very much, Mr. President, for coming. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We'll be having a second summit with Chairman Kim in the not too distant future. Our Secretary of State will be dealing with that subject. Mike Pompeo has been in touch with them, and we've been in touch with them. And I think within a fairly -- pretty short period of time, that will be announced and it will be location to be determined.
But we're both very much looking forward to having it. It will be between North Korea and the United States. It will be similar to the format we had before, most likely a different location. Again, it will be announced pretty soon.
I think a lot of progress is being made. I see tremendous enthusiasm on behalf of Chairman Kim for making a deal, and I think that that's something that's very good. We are in no rush. There's no hurry. We got back three months ago or so. I think we've made more progress than anybody has made in -- ever, frankly, with regard to North Korea.
I really believe North Korea has tremendous economic potential. And I believe that Chairman Kim and the people of North Korea want to see that potential arrived at, and we will help them to that end. And the relationship is very good; in fact, in some ways, it's extraordinary. We'll see what happens. But we will be having a second summit in the not too distant future. Okay? Thank you all very much.
No, I'm meeting with Rod Rosenstein on Thursday when I get back from all of these meetings. And we'll be meeting at the White House, and we'll be determining what's going on. We want to have transparency; we want to have openness. And I look forward to meeting with Rod at that time. Okay?
Well, we're going to have a meeting on Thursday when I get back. Right now, today, we're meeting with a lot of great people, including President Moon. And we're -- over the next couple of days, as you know, we're meeting with many countries. Tomorrow we're giving a big speech, but I'll be back on Thursday. And when I get back, we're going to have meeting. I've spoke with Rod today, and we're going to have meeting on Thursday when I get back to the White House.
I want to say, the country, the United States -- as President Moon pointed out when we first met -- the United States is doing better economically than we've ever done before. The numbers are outstanding. New numbers will be released that I think will just continue this forward march. And I think we have tremendous potential on the upside.
I'm very excited about our new trade agreement. And this is a brand new agreement. This is not an old one, rewritten. This is a brand new agreement. And I'm very excited about that for the United States, and I really believe it's good for both countries.
But the numbers that we're doing in the United States, whether it be unemployment numbers or whether it be employment numbers -- we have right now, this moment, more people working in the United States than ever before in our history. That's some number, Mike, right? And, you know, it's a number that people did not expect to see. It's a number that nobody thought would happen, certainly within two years. We're not even up to two years of the administration. So we have more people working in the United States today than we've ever had.
Our unemployment numbers are among the best they've ever had. For African American, it's the lowest we've ever had. For Asian American, for Hispanics, the lowest we've ever had. And we're very proud of that.
And on top of that, we have many companies moving back into the United States. In most cases, it's back. They left and now they're coming back. They all want to be where the action is.
So I appreciate your kind words, but our economy is the envy right now of the world. We're the fastest growing economy in the world. Think of it. As large as we are, we're the fastest growing economy in the world. Up $10 trillion. So we're very proud of that. Thank you very much everybody.

The biggest, most important people in the world, and we're bringing back tremendous business to the United States, and they're all here to see -- I'll, be making a speech, and then we'll be leaving in shortly. But I think it's very important. The other is just a hoax.
It's the witch hunt that's been going on for years, and it's -- frankly, it's disgraceful. But we look forward to being here. Klaus has done a fantastic job, and again, we're meeting with the big -- biggest companies in the world, the biggest businesses in the world and world leaders, all for the benefit of the United States. We look forward to the meetings.

",Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters After Davos Speech,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-world-economic-forum-davos-january-21-2020
Barack Obama,United States of America,2009-06-23,"Good afternoon, everybody. Today, I want to start by addressing three issues, and then I'll take your questions.
First, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Iran. The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, and imprisonments of the last few days. I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.
I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs. But we must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the Iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society. And we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.
The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- some in the Iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the United States and others in the West of instigating protests over the election. These accusations are patently false. They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking place within Iran's borders. This tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countries won't work anymore in Iran. This is not about the United States or the West; this is about the people of Iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose.
The Iranian people can speak for themselves. That's precisely what's happened in the last few days. In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peaceful protests of justice. Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phones and computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian people are doing.
As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free speech. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own people. It must govern through consent and not coercion. That's what Iran's own people are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government.
Now, the second issue I want to address is our ongoing effort to build a clean energy economy.
This week, the House of Representatives is moving ahead on historic legislation that will transform the way we produce and use energy in America. This legislation will spark a clean energy transformation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and confront the carbon pollution that threatens our planet.
This energy bill will create a set of incentives that will spur the development of new sources of energy, including wind, solar, and geothermal power. It will also spur new energy savings, like efficient windows and other materials that reduce heating costs in the winter and cooling costs in the summer.
These incentives will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy. And that will lead to the development of new technologies that lead to new industries that could create millions of new jobs in America -- jobs that can't be shipped overseas.
At a time of great fiscal challenges, this legislation is paid for by the polluters who currently emit the dangerous carbon emissions that contaminate the water we drink and pollute the air that we breathe. It also provides assistance to businesses and communities as they make the gradual transition to clean energy technologies.
So I believe that this legislation is extraordinarily important for our country; it's taken great effort on the part of many over the course of the past several months. And I want to thank the Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Henry Waxman; his colleagues on that committee, including Congressmen Dingell, Ed Markey, and Rick Boucher. I also want to thank Charlie Rangel, the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and Collin Peterson, the Chair of the Agriculture Committee, for their many and ongoing contributions to this process. And I want to express my appreciation to Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer for their leadership.
We all know why this is so important. The nation that leads in the creation of a clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the 21st century's global economy. That's what this legislation seeks to achieve -- it's a bill that will open the door to a better future for this nation. And that's why I urge members of Congress to come together and pass it.
The last issue I'd like to address is health care.
Right now, Congress is debating various health care reform proposals. This is obviously a complicated issue, but I am very optimistic about the progress that they're making.
Like energy, this is legislation that must and will be paid for. It will not add to our deficits over the next decade. We will find the money through savings and efficiencies within the health care system -- some of which we've already announced.
We will also ensure that the reform we pass brings down the crushing cost of health care. We simply can't have a system where we throw good money after bad habits. We need to control the skyrocketing costs that are driving families, businesses, and our government into greater and greater debt.
There's no doubt that we must preserve what's best about our health care system, and that means allowing Americans who like their doctors and their health care plans to keep them. But unless we fix what's broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Unless we act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, and the rolls of the uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans. Unless we act, one out of every five dollars that we earn will be spent on health care within a decade. And the amount our government spends on Medicare and Medicaid will eventually grow larger than what our government spends on everything else today.
So let me open it up for questions, and I'll start with you, Jennifer.
We have provided a path whereby Iran can reach out to the international community, engage, and become a part of international norms. It is up to them to make a decision as to whether they choose that path. What we've been seeing over the last several days, the last couple of weeks, obviously is not encouraging, in terms of the path that this regime may choose to take. And the fact that they are now in the midst of an extraordinary debate taking place in Iran may end up coloring how they respond to the international community as a whole.
We are going to monitor and see how this plays itself out before we make any judgments about how we proceed. But just to reiterate, there is a path available to Iran in which their sovereignty is respected, their traditions, their culture, their faith is respected, but one in which they are part of a larger community that has responsibilities and operates according to norms and international rules that are universal. We don't know how they're going to respond yet, and that's what we're waiting to see.
Since we're on Iran, I know Nico Pitney is here from Huffington Post.
What we can do is to say unequivocally that there are sets of international norms and principles about violence, about dealing with peaceful dissent, that spans cultures, spans borders. And what we've been seeing over the Internet and what we've been seeing in news reports violates those norms and violates those principles.
I think it is not too late for the Iranian government to recognize that there is a peaceful path that will lead to stability and legitimacy and prosperity for the Iranian people. We hope they take it.
Jeff Mason of Reuters.
I would say that all financial regulators didn't do everything that needed to be done to prevent the crisis from happening. And that's why we've put forward the boldest set of reforms in financial regulation in 75 years, because there were too many gaps where there were laws on the books that would have brought about a prevention of the crisis; the enforcement wasn't there. In some cases, there just weren't sufficient laws on the books -- for example, with the non-banking sector.
I think that the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators prior to the crisis taking place, but I think they'd be the first to acknowledge that in dealing with systemic risk and anticipating systemic risk, they didn't do everything that needed to be done.
I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very well. And one of the central concepts behind our financial regulatory reform is that there's got to be somebody who is responsible not just for monitoring the health of individual institutions, but somebody who's monitoring the systemic risks of the system as a whole. And we believe that the Fed has the most technical expertise and the best track record in terms of doing that.
But that's not the only part of financial regulation. There's a whole bunch of financial transactions out there where consumers are not protected the way they should, and that's why we said we're going to put forward a consumer financial protection agency whose only job it is to focus on those issues.
Now, the Fed was one of the regulators that had some of those consumer responsibilities. We actually think that they're better off focusing on issues of broad systemic risk, and we have just one agency that's focused on the consumer protection side.
Had we had the kinds of resolution authority, the kinds of laws that were in place that would allow a orderly winding down of AIG, then potentially taxpayers could have saved a huge amount of money. We want that power to be available so that taxpayers aren't on the hook.
All right? Major Garrett. Where's Major?
So we've been entirely consistent, Major, in terms of how we've approached this. My role has been to say the United States is not going to be a foil for the Iranian government to try to blame what's happening on the streets of Tehran on the CIA or on the White House; that this is an issue that is led by and given voice to the frustrations of the Iranian people. And so we've been very consistent the first day, and we're going to continue to be consistent in saying this is not an issue about the United States; this is about an issue of the Iranian people.
What we've also been consistent about is saying that there are some universal principles, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, making sure that governments are not using coercion and violence and repression in terms of how they interact with peaceful demonstrators. And we have been speaking out very clearly about that fact.
David Jackson.
I think in this debate there's been some notion that if we just stand pat we're okay. And that's just not true. You know, there are polls out that show that 70 or 80 percent of Americans are satisfied with the health insurance that they currently have. The only problem is that premiums have been doubling every nine years, going up three times faster than wages. The U.S. government is not going to be able to afford Medicare and Medicaid on its current trajectory. Businesses are having to make very tough decisions about whether we drop coverage or we further restrict coverage.
So the notion that somehow we can just keep on doing what we're doing and that's okay, that's just not true. We have a longstanding critical problem in our health care system that is pulling down our economy, it's burdening families, it's burdening businesses, and it is the primary driver of our federal deficits. All right?
Number two, while we are in the process of dealing with the cost issue, I think it's also wise policy and the right thing to do to start providing coverage for people who don't have health insurance or are underinsured, are paying a lot of money for high deductibles. I get letters -- two, three letters a day -- that I read of families who don't have health insurance, are going bankrupt, are on the brink of losing their insurance; have deductibles that are so high that even with insurance they end up with $50,000, $100,000 worth of debt; are at risk of losing their homes.
And that has to be part of reform, making sure that even if you've got health insurance now, you are not worried that when you lose your job or your employer decides to change policies that somehow you're going to be out of luck. I think about the woman who was in Wisconsin that I was with, who introduced me up in Green Bay -- 36 years old, double mastectomy; breast cancer has now moved to her bones and she's got two little kids, a husband with a job. They had health insurance, but they're still $50,000 in debt, and she's thinking, my main legacy, if I don't survive this thing, is going to be leaving $100,000 worth of debt. So those are the things that I'm prioritizing.
Now, the public plan I think is a important tool to discipline insurance companies. What we've said is, under our proposal, let's have a system the same way that federal employees do, same way that members of Congress do, where -- we call it an ""exchange,"" or you can call it a ""marketplace"" -- where essentially you've got a whole bunch of different plans. If you like your plan and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing. You keep your plan. You keep your doctor. If your employer is providing you good health insurance, terrific, we're not going to mess with it.
Now, I think that there's going to be some healthy debates in Congress about the shape that this takes. I think there can be some legitimate concerns on the part of private insurers that if any public plan is simply being subsidized by taxpayers endlessly, that over time they can't compete with the government just printing money.
So there are going to be some I think legitimate debates to be had about how this private plan takes shape. But just conceptually, the notion that all these insurance companies who say they're giving consumers the best possible deal, that they can't compete against a public plan as one option, with consumers making the decision what's the best deal. That defies logic, which is why I think you've seen in the polling data overwhelming support for a public plan. All right?
I mean, you guys must have seen the reports. They've got some of the comments that I've made being mistranslated in Iran, suggesting that I'm telling rioters to go out and riot some more. There are reports suggesting that the CIA is behind all this -- all of which are patently false. But it gives you a sense of the narrative that the Iranian government would love to play into. So the -- members of Congress, they've got their constitutional duties, and I'm sure they will carry them out in the way that they think is appropriate. I'm President of the United States, and I'll carry out my duties as I think are appropriate. All right?
And, frankly, a lot of them aren't paying a lot of attention to what's being said on Capitol Hill, and probably aren't spending a lot of time thinking about what's being said here. They're trying to figure out how can they make sure justice is served in Iran.
Jake Tapper.
There are a whole host of other issues where ultimately I may have a strong opinion, and I will express those to members of Congress as this is shaping up. It's too early to say that. Right now I will say that our position is that a public plan makes sense.
Now, let me go to the broader question you made about the public plan. As I said before, I think that there is a legitimate concern if the public plan was simply eating off the taxpayer trough, that it would be hard for private insurers to complete. If, on the other hand, the public plan is structured in such a way where they've got to collect premiums and they've got to provide good services, then if what the insurance companies are saying is true, that they're doing their best to serve their customers, that they're in the business of keeping people well and giving them security when they get sick, they should be able to compete.
Now, if it turns out that the public plan, for example, is able to reduce administrative costs significantly, then you know what? I'd like insurance companies to take note and say, hey, if the public plan can do that, why can't we? And that's good for everybody in the system. And I don't think there should be any objection to that.
Now, by the way, I should point out that part of the reform that we've suggested is that if you want to be a private insurer as part of the exchange, as part of this marketplace, this menu of options that people can choose from, we're going to have some different rules for all insurance companies -- one of them being that you can't preclude people from getting health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, you can't cherry pick and just take the healthiest people.
So there are going to be some ground rules that are going to apply to all insurance companies, because I think the American people understand that, too often, insurance companies have been spending more time thinking about how to take premiums and then avoid providing people coverage than they have been thinking about how can we make sure that insurance is there, health care is there when families need it.
But I'm confident that if -- I take those advocates of the free market to heart when they say that the free market is innovative and is going to compete on service and is going to compete on their ability to deliver good care to families. And if that's the case then this just becomes one more option. If it's not the case then I think that that's something that the American people should know.
And so there are going to be a whole set of changes out there. That's exactly why health reform is so important.
Margaret, from McClatchy. Where's Margaret? There you are.
But I've said before that, as a former smoker, I constantly struggle with it. Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No. I don't do it in front of my kids, I don't do it in front of my family, and I would say that I am 95 percent cured, but there are times where -- there are times where I mess up. And, I mean, I've said this before. I get this question about once every month or so, and I don't know what to tell you, other than the fact that, like folks who go to AA, once you've gone down this path, then it's something you continually struggle with, which is precisely why the legislation we signed was so important, because what we don't want is kids going down that path in the first place. Okay?
Macarena Vidal?
We think that there's enormous possibilities of making progress in Latin America generally. One of the things that I'll be talking about with President Bachelet is the coordination and cooperation between the United State and Chile on clean energy. We'll have an announcement when we do our press conference after my bilateral meeting on some important clean energy partnerships. We're making important progress when it comes to exchanges on cancer research. We continue to have a robust trade regime with Chile. And, by the way, Chile has actually entered into some very interesting partnerships not just with the federal government, but also with state governments like California.
And so if you take a Bachelet or a Lula, and the United States has a good working relationship with them, then I think that points the way for other countries that may be where the democratic tradition is not as deeply embedded as we'd like it to be. And we can make common cause in showing those countries that, in fact, democracy, respect for property rights, respects for market-based economies, rule of law -- that all those things can in fact lead to greater prosperity, that that's not just a U.S. agenda, but that's a smart way to increase the prosperity of your own people.
Okay, Hans Nichols. Hans.
And so it's not surprising then that we missed the mark in terms of our estimates of where unemployment would go. I think it's pretty clear now that unemployment will end up going over 10 percent, if you just look at the pattern, because of the fact that even after employers and businesses start investing again and start hiring again, typically it takes a while for that employment number to catch up with economic recovery. And we're still not at actual recovery yet.
So I anticipate that this is going to be a difficult -- difficult year, a difficult period.
Now, what we also know is this was the worst recession since the Great Depression, and people are going through a very tough time right now. And I don't expect them to be satisfied. I mean, one thing that -- as I sometimes glance at the various news outlets represented here, I know that they're sometimes reporting of, oh, the administration is worried about this, or their poll numbers are going down there -- look, the American people have a right to feel like this is a tough time right now. What's incredible to me is how resilient the American people have been and how they are still more optimistic than the facts alone would justify, because this is a tough, tough period.
And I don't feel satisfied with the progress that we've made. We've got to get our Recovery Act money out faster. We've got to make sure that the programs that we've put in place are working the way they're supposed to. I think, for example, our mortgage program has actually helped to modify mortgages for a lot of people, but it hasn't been keeping pace with all the foreclosures that are taking place. I get letters every day from people who say, you know, I appreciate that you put out this mortgage program, but the bank is still not letting me modify my mortgage and I'm about to lose my home. And then I've got to call my staff and team and find out why isn't it working for these folks, and can we adjust it, can we tweak it, can we make it more aggressive?
This is a very, very difficult process. And what I've got to do is to make sure that we're focused both on the short term, how can we provide families immediate relief and jumpstart the economy as quickly as possible; and I've got to keep my eye on the long term, and the long term is making sure that by reforming our health care system, by passing serious energy legislation that makes us a clean energy economy, by revamping our education system, by finally getting the financial regulatory reforms in place that are necessary for the 21st century -- by doing all those things, we've got a foundation for long-term economic growth, and we don't end up having to juice up the economy artificially through the kinds of bubble strategies that helped to get us in the situation that we're in today.
Okay. I've got time for two more questions. April. Where's April?
It is true that in certain inner-city communities, the unemployment rate is -- was already sky high even before this recession. The ladders available for people to enter into the job market are even worse. And so we are interested in looking at proven programs that help people on a pathway to jobs.
There was a reason why right before Father's Day I went to a program here locally in Washington called Year Up, which has a proven track record of taking young, mostly minority people, some of whom have graduated from high school, some maybe who've just gotten their GED, and trained them on computers and provide them other technical skills, but also train them on how to carry themselves in an office, how to write an e-mail -- some of the social skills that will allow them to be more employable. They've got a terrific placement rate after this one-year program. If there are ways that we can potentially duplicate some of those programs, then we're going to do so.
So part of what we want to do is to find tools that will give people more opportunity, but the most important thing I can do is to lift the economy overall. And that's what my strategy is focused on.
All right. Last Question. Suzanne.
All right. Thank you, guys.
",Third Major Press Conference -- On Iran and Health Care,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamapressconferenceiranandhealthcare.htm
Rachel Reeves,United Kingdom,2020-07-12,"This leaked letter lifts the lid on a growing sense of chaos and confusion between Cabinet Ministers at the Government’s complacent approach to vital preparations ahead of 31 December.
There is growing alarm from the business communities in Northern Ireland and increasingly in Britain that Ministers aren’t being entirely open about the state of preparations.
These issues will affect countless businesses and jobs and are simply far too important to be left to written correspondence like this. This extraordinary letter deserves answers, not just given to the House of Commons, but to the industries and people who stand to be affected if the Government gets this badly wrong.
",2020 Comments on Leaked Liz Truss Letter,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/rachel-reeves-2020-comments-on-leaked-liz-truss-letter/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2009-05-11,"Nice to talk to you, Greta.
Well, that's actually true, and we're having a news conference tomorrow at 11:00 o'clock at Trump Tower, and Carrie will be there. And we're reviewing lots of things tonight and we're reviewing lots of things tomorrow morning, but we'll be having a news conference to announce certain things tomorrow.
Probably so.
Well, look, first of all, I always like to give the benefit of the doubt to somebody. And I did that with Tara Connor, and she's really made me very proud because she's come through beautifully, at least so far. I mean, she was really suffering from major addictions, and she's really done a great job and we're all proud of her.
And so that was a great thing. And most people didn't think I should do that. I took a lot of heat for doing it. So I was very happy with it. This is a very different case. And we'll see what happens. But we are determining tonight, certain things have already been determined, and you know, hopefully, you'll be at the news conference.
Well, there are a couple of disqualifiers, Greta, but I can't really talk about it now because we're going over that late tonight.
She will tomorrow morning. She's actually coming in tomorrow morning prior to the news conference.
It's amazing, what happened. And I will tell you this. The reason it's gotten this tremendous attention is because she's a great beauty. If she were a good-looking person, if she were an average-looking person or if she were a poor-looking person -- frankly, this is an issue that's discussed every day by millions of people and nobody talks about it.
No, because of her great beauty...
Greta, because of her...
Well, I think -- I'm talking about the issue relating to the question, the famous question about, Should a man be able to marry a man versus a woman or a woman with a man? So it's a very interesting question. It's a very complex question. It's a tough question, certainly, for a beauty pageant, but it shows how relevant these pageants really are.
You know, for years, they were saying, Oh, are they relevant? Well, they got good ratings on television, but people would say, Are they relevant? Well, the fact is, if you look at what happened initially to Tara with alcohol and drug addiction, that's a very relevant subject. If you look at what is happening now with the whole question of gay marriage, that's a very relevant situation.
So the beauty pageants are bringing things into focus very clearly.
Well, let me just state that the Miss America pageant, which you mentioned -- and it's too bad you were on there because it's sort of wasting time -- the Miss America pageant is off the air. The Miss America pageant has -- you know, that was a big pageant and that one essentially ceases to exist in any very strong form because, as you know, it's on cable now, barely, and it's no longer on network television.
The Miss USA and the Miss Universe are on network television and Miss Universe is broadcast all over the world. Now, those are the two that I own. But Miss America has gone down very, very, very substantially from its glory days, and maybe it's because it is not relevant enough or it doesn't ask relevant enough questions, Greta.
You know, we could ask very simple questions, like, Did you have a good lunch today? And people would probably not find it very interesting. We're asking very tough questions. This was a tough question. But if you look at the other questions that were asked of the other contestants, they were also very tough questions.
But there's a big difference because the Miss America pageant is no longer essentially on network television.
Yes, they've renewed it, as you heard. We got great ratings last night, as usual, and they're bringing it back. NBC announced about two weeks ago that they're bringing it back. It's had a great season, ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we're now coming back for a ninth season of ""The Apprentice.""
So long, Greta.

",Brief Remarks: Donald Trump Meets with Mahmoud Abbas,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-mahmoud-abbas-oval-office-may-3-2017
Jack Straw,United Kingdom,2020-08-25,"Let me begin with a confession. There are many aspects of the job of Foreign Secretary which I love.
However, every so often, in amongst the complaints, the bad news and the requests for the impossible, I find one letter which truly brightens my day. Such letters are always welcome; but none more so than the one which invited me to come here tonight to receive this award. Accepting that invitation was certainly one of the easier and more pleasant decisions I have had to make.
It is indeed an immense honour to receive this award from you. And I want to thank the President of the High Advisory Council, Mustafa Koc, the Chairman of the Board, Omer Sabanci, and all the members of TUSIAD for the friendship and support which this award represents.
Now, as I have said, I count Abdullah as a friend. We have worked together closely for many years and on many difficult tasks. It is always a pleasure to see him – and tonight is no exception. But I don’t think that there has ever been a time when I have been happier to glimpse him heading in my direction than on a cold night in Luxembourg just under four months ago.
That night was a night to remember. But in accepting this award, I am conscious of two things. First, that the credit for getting agreement to open membership talks does not fall to any single person, group or country. And second, that we are at the beginning of a process and not at the end.
In October, we were proud to play our role as Presidency. There were obstacles to be overcome. But with courage and flexibility we were able to do so. The political leadership shown by all sides that night was crucial. But – and this is something which I wrote to Omer Sabanci when I first accepted this award – our success was above all a reflection of Turkey’s own accomplishments over recent years; and an acknowledgement of this country’s future within Europe. In the end, we opened accession talks in October because it was in all our interests to do so – in Turkey’s interest, in the interest of the European Union as a whole, and of every other individual state.
Economically, the European single market will be stronger by expanding to take in a country which in 2006 is projected to see an impressive GDP growth of around six per cent – more than three times the average growth in the EU-25. This is also a country which attracted foreign investment to the tune of US$ 24 billion last year – hard evidence that the private sector has firm faith in Turkey’s future.
And there is no better reminder of the political importance of Turkey than this great city itself. For thousands of years Istanbul has been a bridge between Asia and Europe; and during that long and illustrious history it has been a centre for both the Christian and Muslim faiths.
Turkey’s geographical position is of huge strategic importance, with such interesting neighbours such as Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia and Georgia, as well as EU partners Bulgaria and Greece. I applaud Turkey for the contribution it is playing in difficult dossiers like Iran Nuclear; and on Iraq where an important meeting in December held here encouraged the Sunni communities to take part in last months elections – and on the MEPP, where the Government of Turkey facilitated last years historic meeting between Israel and Pakistan. We already depend on Turkey for good cooperation against terrorism, drug trafficking and illegal migration, and increasingly for the security of energy supplies to Europe.
Despite these mutual dependencies on Turkey, it is no secret that some people within the European Union worry about the potential impact of Turkish membership, especially on their jobs and livelihoods. European leaders have a responsibility to allay those fears and to set out to their citizens the overwhelmingly positive case – as I have above –– for Turkey, when ready, joining the Union.
We in the United Kingdom – Government and business alike – are in absolutely no doubt that our own interests lie in ever closer partnership with this modern, European country. The United Kingdom and Turkey have enjoyed a good bilateral relationship for many years. In 2004, Prime Ministers Blair and Erdogan signed an action plan to further bolster bilateral ties. And the relationship now is closer than it’s ever been.
Today, the United Kingdom is the second largest destination for Turkish exports, bilateral trade between our two countries stands at around US$ 10 billion per annum. There are 400 British companies in operation here. A single British company, Vodafone, is investing over US$ 4.5 billion here. Another, BP, is the largest single shareholder in the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Some of the chief executives of the largest of those British companies are here tonight: Vodafone, International Power, HSBC and Diageo. Also present is Ladbrokes, which is interested in the privatisation of the Turkish lottery.
And, of course, it’s not just about exchanges in goods and capital. The British Council – which runs cultural and educational exchanges – has a bigger operation in Turkey than in any of the current EU-25 member states. On a very personal note, the Turkish footballer Tugay Kerimoglu has been terrific as a team member of Blackburn Rovers on the field; but he is also a great ambassador for Turkey and imperceptibly I believe the presence in our team of a player of the Muslim faith has encouraged more of my Muslim constituents to attend matches. And last year around 1.8 million British tourists came to Turkey – a year on year increase of nearly 30 per cent, in spite of July’s cowardly terrorist attacks in Kusadasi and other resorts.
The second point I wanted to make this evening is this. On October 3rd we ended a long journey dating back to Turkey’s original association agreement with the EEC in 1963. But we also embarked on a new road which may take a decade or more and which will require continued flexibility and commitment from all sides. That process, leading to full membership, of itself draws Turkey, its people and its institutions closer to Europe.
A settlement on Cyprus – under the good offices of the UN Secretary General and under the authority of a number of UN Security Council Resolutions – is, of course, vital.
I welcome Abdullah Gul’s proposals on Cyprus set out in his speech yesterday. If I may so, Abdullah, you rightly say the current deadlock works against the interest of all. I welcome the priority the Turkish Government continues to give to the tasks of finding a lasting and just comprehensive settlement, and to your willingness to take concrete steps to improve the overall atmosphere in the region. Like Olli Rehn I believe that these proposals should be examined with care.
Both the European Union and Turkey have responsibilities they must fulfil in regard of Cyprus: Turkey to apply the Ankara Protocol fully to all member states and to normalise relations with them as soon as possible; we to find a way of ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and for them to trade with the rest of the European Union. These are separate tracks but they must both work.
My belief is that the very process of holding accession talks – the daily, mundane business of political engagement – will help break barriers and give impetus to the resolution of this dispute; much as it was an important element in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland resolving our differences over Northern Ireland. But – just as in that long-running problem – it will require bold leadership and some tough decisions.
It’s also important, of course, that the momentum for reform and modernisation is maintained; and that the political will of Prime Minister Erdogan’s government – which is not in any doubt – is reflected in the decisions taken by those applying laws on the ground. Thankfully the case against Orhan Pamuk has now been dropped but there are a number of others ongoing, and I know that Abdullah and his colleagues are all to aware that such cases have the potential overshadow Turkey’s considerable achievements over the past few years.
I’m aware that I’ve been speaking for quite a while. If I was receiving an award at the Oscars they would have started up the orchestra and bundled me off stage by now. So may I just finish by once again thanking all the members of TUSIAD for this Bosphorus Prize for European Understanding. In all honesty, I cannot think of an award I would rather receive.
",2006 Comments on Turkey Joining the European Union (EU),http://www.ukpol.co.uk/jack-straw-2006-comments-on-turkey-joining-the-european-union-eu/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-05-15,"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It’s very hot today. Please sit down. This is going to be a very hot one and we apologize to everybody out there that’s got to suffer through it. But you know what? It’s better than bad weather and it’s great to be in the rose garden. I want to especially thank this group for joining us as we announce a historic groundbreaking initiative in our ongoing effort to rapidly develop and manufacture a coronavirus vaccine. We’re joined by secretary Steven Mnuchin, Secretary Mark Esper, Secretary Alex Azar, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, FDA Director, Dr. Stephen Hahn, Director of the National Institute of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx. We’re joined by a very terrific group of professionals.
Tomorrow will mark 30 days since we released the White House guidelines for a safe and phased opening of America. That’s what we’re doing. It’s the opening of America. We’re going to have an amazing year next year. We’re going to have a great transition into the fourth quarter. As of this morning, almost every state has taken steps to begin reopening and the American people are doing an extraordinary job of continuing to take precautions while at the same time wanting to start, and they will be starting, to resume their American way of life. We will be reigniting our economic engines. We’re going to be taking care of our most vulnerable, which are our senior citizens and some others. We’re going to be working very, very hard on our senior citizens and our nursing homes and various communities to support those that are struggling in this very difficult time. Others don’t have the same kind of struggle.
For example, today, Secretary Perdue, together with Ivanka Trump, launched the Farmers and Families Food Box Program, which will provide $3 billion to help small farmers. And it will be helping farmers, ranchers, but it’ll be bringing food to some of the food lines and some of the food kitchens that you’ve been seeing on television. And I said, “Why aren’t we doing that? We have all of this tremendous food produced by our farmers and our ranchers.” And so we’re going to be buying $3 billion worth of that food, great for everybody. Our farmers, our ranchers, and the people that need great food.
A key feature of our reopening plan is the largest and most ambitious testing system in the world by far. America is now conducting close to 350,000 tests per day, an unthinkable number just a short while ago, more than anybody in the world by far, suggesting many states now have excess testing capacity to monitor for new outbreaks. Florida, many other states have so much testing the testers are waiting for people to show up. It’s great.
Another essential pillar of our strategy to keep America open is the development of effective treatments and vaccines as quickly as possible. Want to see if we can do that very quickly. We’re looking to, when I say quickly, we’re looking to get it by the end of the year if we can, maybe before. We’re doing tremendously well. From the earliest days of the pandemic, we have marshaled the genius of American scientists and researchers from all across government and the private sector, from academia, from everywhere to vanquish the virus, and tremendous strides have been made. Can tell you, I get to see it every day. Tremendous strides are being made. Scientists at the NIH began developing the first vaccine candidate on January 11th, think of that, within hours of the virus’s genetic code being posted online. So January 11th, most people never even heard what was going on January 11th. And we were out there trying to develop a vaccine, not even knowing what we were up against. Then my administration cut through every piece of red tape to achieve the fastest ever, by far, launch of a vaccine trial for this new virus, this very vicious virus. And I want to thank all of the doctors and scientists and researchers involved because they’ve never moved like this or never even close.
The NIH and the HHS have also been working constantly with private industry to evaluate more than 100 potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has swiftly approved more than 130 therapies for active trials. That’s what we have right now, 130. And another 450 are in the planning stages and tremendous potential awaits. I think we’re going to have some very interesting things to report in the not too distant future. And thank you very much to Dr. Hahn. Through a historic series of funding bills, my administration is providing roughly $10 billion to support a medical research effort without parallel. I especially want to thank Senator Steve Daines of Montana for his incredible work. He has worked so hard to secure additional funding for vaccine development. He has been right at the forefront.
Today, I want to update you on the next stage of this momentous medical initiative. It’s called Operation Warp Speed. That means big and it means fast, a massive scientific, industrial and logistical endeavor unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project. You really could say that nobody’s seen anything like we’re doing, whether it’s ventilators or testing. Nobody’s seen anything like we’re doing now within our country since the second World War, incredible. Its objective is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible. Again, we’d love to see if we could do it prior to the end of the year. We think we’re going to have some very good results coming out very quickly.
In addition, it will continue accelerating the development of diagnostics and breakthrough therapies. The great national project will bring together the best of American industry and innovation, the full resources of the United States government, and the excellence and precision of the United States military. We have the military totally involved. We’re also working very strongly with other countries who are also have some great, great scientists, doctors, and we’re all working very closely together and they’re viewing us as the leader and we are. The relationship with other countries on solving this problem has been incredible. Today, the Operation Warp Speed has brought together all of the experts across the federal government from places like the NIH, CDC, FDA, and many other agencies. This historic partnership will now bring together the full resources of the Department of Health and Human Services with the Department of Defense. And we know what that means. That means the full power and strength of military, the military, and that really talking about the logistics. We get it when we get it. That means the logistics, getting it out so that everybody can take it.
And today, we’re proud to announce the addition of two of the most highly respected skilled professionals in our country, worldwide respected. Operation Warp Speed’s chief scientists will be Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a world renowned immunologist who helped create 14 new vaccines, that’s a lot of our new vaccines, in 10 years during his time in the private sector. One of the most respected men in the world in the production and, really, on the formulation of vaccines. Joining Dr. Slaoui as Chief Operating Officer will be General Gus Perna, a four star general who currently oversees 190,000 service members, civilians, and contractors as Commander of the US Army Material Command. That means logistics. That means getting it out. We’ve got to get it out there. So General, thank you very much. And doctor, thank you very much. It’s great to have you on board. Really highly respected people. Thank you.
It’s great to have you on board. Really highly respected people. Thank you.
These two outstanding individuals will provide more details following my remarks. In preparation for this initiative, experts throughout the government have been collaborating to evaluate roughly 100 vaccine candidates from all over the world. They have identified 14 that they believe are the most promising and they’re working to narrow that list still further. So we started off with over 100, we’re down to 14, and we have some really interesting choices to be made. They’re doing very well.
Through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government is providing unprecedented support and resources to safely expedite the trials. Moving on at record, record, record speed. While we accelerate the final phases of vaccine trials, Operation Warp Speed will be simultaneously accelerating its manufacturing and manufacturing process. In other words, we’re getting ready so that when we get the good word that we have the vaccine, we have the formula, we have what we need, we’re ready to go. As opposed to taking years to gear up. We’re gearing up. It’s risky, it’s expensive, but we’ll be saving massive amounts of time. We’ll be saving years if we do this properly. And that’s what we’re doing. So we’re gearing up on the assumption that we’ll have in the near future, relatively near future, a vaccine.
Typically pharmaceutical companies wait to manufacture a vaccine until it has received all of the regulatory approvals necessary. And this can delay vaccines availability to the public as much as a year, and even more than that. However, our task is so urgent that under Operation Warp Speed, the federal government will invest in manufacturing all of the top vaccine candidates before they’re approved. So we’re knowing exactly what we’re doing before they’re approved. That means they better come up with a good vaccine, because we’re ready to deliver it. This will eliminate any unnecessary delay and enable us to begin providing Americans with a proven vaccine the day our scientists say, “We’re ready, we got it.”
And as we work to bring critical medical production back to America, these vaccines that we’re going to be focused on and manufacturing, they’re all going to be right here in the USA. Now we’re working, as I said, with other people outside, and that’s fine too. We want to get to the solution. We know exactly where the other countries are and we’ll be very happy if they were able to do it. We’ll help them with delivery, we’ll help them with it in every way we can. We have no ego when it comes to this. No ego whatsoever. Operation Warp Speed is also making the necessary preparations to distribute these life saving treatments at scale. So we’re talking about massive numbers so that millions of Americans will quickly have access to them. This includes ramping up production of supplies needed for distribution. And I have to say, we’re also very, very much involved in other things other than the vaccine. If you take a look at what we’re doing beyond vaccines, it’s going to be very interesting. We may talk about that in a little while. But this includes ramping up production of supplies needed for distribution, such as cold chain storage, glass vials, needles, syringes, and more. We’ll have everything right on hand, ready to go.
When a vaccine is ready, the US government will deploy every plane, truck and soldier required to help distribute it to the American people as quickly as possible. America’s blessed to have the most brilliant, talented doctors and researchers anywhere in the world. We have the mightiest military by far in the world. Our military is completely rebuilt. Much of the equipment has been delivered. Some of it’s on the way. All made right here in the USA. We took over very, very empty cupboards, I say, medically. We also had empty cupboards in a military sense. Our military was in sad shape. It was depleted. We now have the strongest military the United States has ever had by far, and the best equipment. And you hear that outside, that beautiful sound, those are truckers that are with us all the way. They’re protesting in favor of President Trump, as opposed to against. There’s hundreds of trucks out there. And that’s the sign of love, not the sign of your typical protest. So I want to thank our great truckers. They like me and I like them. We’re working on something together.
But we have the mightiest… And they’ll be helping us with this, by the way. Speaking of truckers. We have the mightiest military in the long history of humankind. We have the best and most devoted workers ever to walk the face of the earth. And now we’re combining all of these amazing strengths for the most aggressive vaccine project in history. There’s never been a vaccine project anywhere in history like this. And I just want to make something clear. It’s very important, vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back. And we’re starting the process. And in many cases they don’t have vaccines and a virus or a flu comes and you fight through it. We haven’t seen anything like this in 100 and some odd years, 1917, but you fight through it. And people sometimes, I guess, we don’t know exactly yet, but it looks like they become immune or at least for a short while and maybe for life. But you fight through it. But what we’d like to do, if we can, is the vaccine. And I think we’re going to be successful in doing it, and hopefully by the end of the year.
Just as generations of Americans before us faced down the most difficult trials, set their sights on the highest summit and overcame the biggest obstacles, america will meet the moment, and this moment specifically in our time, with unrivaled speed, unmatched scale, and the unyielding spirit of the American people. Our nation will come back stronger and greater than ever. We’re going to have a tremendous year next year. We’re going to have a really good fourth quarter. We’re going to have a very interesting and productive transition quarter, where Steve is there, And I’m sure our Secretary of the Treasury, I think you feel the same way, Steve. And thank you for your good work. Really good work. And it’s not finished yet, is it? I want to thank Steve Mnuchin, everybody.
Now I’d like to ask Dr. Thank you all very much. We’re doing something that has never been done before. It’s a going to result in a tremendous end. I think we’re going to come up with a solution to a problem like this country probably has never seen before. But it’s an honor to be your president. We’re doing a great job. These people are doing an incredible job. The people right here, I want to thank you all. Total professionals. Great men, great women. Thank you all very much. Please.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
I know you will. I know you will. Any questions please? Yeah, go ahead.
We think we’re going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future. And if we do, we’re going to really be a big step ahead. And if we don’t, we’re going to be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it’ll go away. At some point, it’ll go away. It may flare up and it may not flare up, we’ll have to see what happens. But if it does flare up, we’re going to put out the fire and we’ll put it out quickly and efficiently. We’ve learned a lot. Steve, do you have a question?
Well, they started… Actually, I guess you heard in early January and they’ve been on it… I know so many, and private companies have been working on it. The government’s been working on it. We’ve got the time because we put a very… And they’ve literally been working 24 hours a day. We’ve got the time, and we hope to be able to do something by the end of the year or shortly thereafter.
But again, it’s not solely vaccine based. Other things have never had a vaccine and they go away. I don’t want people to think that this is all dependent on a vaccine, but a vaccine would be a tremendous thing. And I will tell you, therapeutically or therapeutics, what’s going on there is equally as oppressive. We have some things happening. We have the remdesivir from Gilead. We have other things that are very good. I think that a lot is happening therapeutically. I can’t say that it’s relatively-speaking equal to what’s going on with vaccines, but I think it’s doing very well, very well. Therapeutics are a big factor. Yeah, please.
Yeah. We have that very well worked out. Whoever gets it is going to be very proud to give it, and they’ve developed it. And we’ll see what happens. We’ve got countries that are allies. We have some countries, frankly, that aren’t allies, we’re working very closely together. We’re working together with many different countries. And again, we have no ego. We have no ego. Whoever gets it, we think it’s great. We’re going to work with them. They’re going to work with us. Likewise, if we get it, we’re going to be working with them. It’s very important. It’s very good question actually. Yeah, please.
Well, I thought the guidance was very good. I’ve heard very good reviews on the guidance. The media will never be satisfied. If we gave you more description, that would be no good. If we gave you less, that would be no good. But I thought it was very good and I’ve heard a lot of good things. Go ahead, please, Green.
No, Abbott’s a great test. It’s a very quick test and it can always be very rapidly double-checked. If you’re testing positive or negative, it can always be double-checked, but it’s a very good test. It’s very portable, very quick. Okay.
I would say the answer to that would be yes. I would say the answer would be yes. Yes, go ahead please.
Excuse me, you’re going to have to remove it. You can’t hear through your…
No, we’re looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it. Not everybody’s going to want to get it, but we’re looking at a full vaccine. Is that a correct statement?
Please.
We’ve all been tested. I’ve been tested. We’ve all been tested and we’re quite a distance away and we’re outdoor. So I told them, I gave them the option. They could wear it or not. So you can blame it on me, but I gave them the option. We could wear it or not. Yeah, please.
The last thing anybody’s looking for is profit in terms of what we’re doing. Every company, they want to get it out. We’ve had a great experience on everything we’ve done. People are looking to come up with the answer. They’re not looking in … Typically they’re saying, “How much am I going to make? How much?” They really have been, there’s been a great spirit on this. They want to get to the bottom of it. And I think we’ll be able to do that.
So, India has been so great. And as you know, your prime minister has been a very good friend of mine. I just got back a short while ago from India recently, and we’re working very much with India too. We have a tremendous Indian population in the United States. Many of the people that you’re talking about are working on the vaccine too, great scientists and researchers. Yeah. We’re working very closely also with India. Correct. And say hello to your prime minister. Yeah, please. Go ahead.
Yeah, I think we’ve done a good job with that. Certain areas have been hit very hard, New York, New Jersey, et cetera, et cetera, working very closely with the governors. We’ve worked with all of the governors. We’ve made a lot of people look very good with what we’ve done on ventilators, with what we’ve done on testing. We’re working with all of the governors. We just sent a big transit package to New Jersey. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, who is a terrific person, by the way, I have to tell you. And I just told him, “A lot of money’s coming way for the transit.” And also I spoke with the governor of New York, Governor Cuomo. We just had a conversation yesterday. We’re sending them a lot of transportation money. So it’s important. But we’ve had a very good relationship working with all of the states, regardless. All of the states. And if we do get fortunate enough, and I think we’re skilled enough, but fortunate enough to have a vaccine, it’ll get out fairly and quickly.
I think that makes sense, perhaps. Perhaps it does, but I would say probably, but I think they’re all going to get well distributed. If you remember where we started, we had no ventilators. We had to make them and we became a very major manufacturer of ventilators. Now we’re helping countries all over the world with ventilators. We’re sending them to many countries all over the world. When we started, we didn’t have ventilators. I inherited nothing. I inherited practically nothing from the previous administration, unfortunately. Yeah, go ahead.
Well, I don’t want to talk about it. I can say China is buying a lot of our product, but the trade deal, the ink was barely dry when this came in from China. So it’s not like we’re thrilled. Okay, go ahead. Please.
Yeah.
Well, I don’t know what happened. I know that Voice of America is run in a terrible manner, terrible. They’re not the voice of America, they’re the opposite of the voice of America. And we have a man who is very good. I don’t know. He’s in the nominating process, but I’ll have to check that out. Yeah, please.
Well, I think a very big factor frankly is that very few people are … We read about all of the very sad, very tragic. I’ve lost friends. Many of us have lost friends. We read about that and we see that, and that’s what the news covers, but it’s a very small percentage. It’s a very, very small percentage. I say it all the time. It’s a tiny percentage. The vast majority, many people don’t even know they have it. They have it or they have sniffles or they have a very minor sign and they recover. Not only recover, they probably have immunity, whether it’s short term, long term, but they have probably immunity. And I think people have to understand that. That’s why I think the schools should be back in the fall. I think that lots of things should happen. I don’t think that you should have 70 year old teachers back yet. They should wait until everything is gone. I don’t think you should have a professor that’s 65 and has diabetes, or has a bad heart back necessarily, or somebody that’s older than that. But we want to see our schools back.
We want to see our country start to work again. We created the greatest economy in the history of the world and we’re going to do it again. And you’re going to see that next year. And it’s going to start, you’ll start to see it in the fourth quarter, maybe even before that. Yeah.
I’m concerned about everything. And I’m also concerned about our country. Our country has to get back. What you’re talking is when you are doing what we did with the shutdown, that causes death also. It causes massive depression. It causes drugs, it causes suicide. It causes a lot of problems also. No, our country has to get back to work again. And you see that just looking and reading everything that’s happening are people want to get back. They want to get back. Yeah.
We do. We do. We have a great plan to prevent the spread, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to close our country for five years. Okay. Not going to happen.
Go ahead.
At current, it’s about 86,000. Yes.
Or lower than that, I don’t know. I don’t know. Those are the numbers that are being reported. I assume they’re correct. Unlike other countries, I mean, you have some countries, obviously, you have some that are very obviously ridiculous, but our numbers are accurate numbers. We don’t do anything with the numbers one way or the other. Whatever it is, that’s what we do. We take the numbers as reported. Okay?
Oh, I don’t know. I don’t know. If they were, I’d be very happy if they were lower. I’d like to see numbers lower. I’d like to see no death at all. One death is too many. This should have never happened. This came from China. It should have been stopped in China before it got out to the world. We have 186, it’s been updated this morning, 186 countries are affected, and each country that’s affected is the same thing. Russia now is badly affected. France is badly affected. You look at what each country, and you can say affected, or you can say infected, either way you want to put it, but you look at these countries. Look at Italy and you look at Spain and you look at all of these great countries in many cases, how they’ve had to fight through this. It’s a terrible thing that happened. It could have been stopped at the source. It should have been stopped right at the source, but it wasn’t. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
",Donald Trump Speech Transcript on Vaccine Development for Coronavirus,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-on-vaccine-development-for-coronavirus
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-10-15,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Let’s see, it’s 1:30. This is a hell of a crowd for 1:30 in the afternoon. Thank you.
Great state. It’s fantastic to be back in North Carolina with thousands of loyal, hard working Americans patriots. 19 days from now, think of that, 19 days, do you believe this? We’re going to win the State of North Carolina, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins. Do you see what’s going on? When we win, North Carolina wins and America wins. It’s very simple.
For the last 47 years. Joe Biden’s betrayed the workers of North Carolina through one act of economic treachery after another and now you see what’s happening. They got caught stealing folks. Biden’s a servant of the wealthy donors and globalist and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry, taking your jobs from North Carolina and every other place and moving them out of the country. We turned it around. You got to remember that.
These corrupt forces, they don’t see our nation as a protector of its citizens, but as a vehicle for personal profit and power at your expense, and you see it happening right now. They hold everyone in contempt and they always put the American worker last and that’s what’s happened until I came along. In fact, it’s the primary reason I came along if you think about it.
They keep their jobs while outsourcing your jobs to other countries, countries that you’ve never even heard about. They build walls for themselves while forcing your family to suffer the consequences of illegal immigration, drugs, and crime. You know it very well over here.
For five decades, Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars, and you know, they’re all coming back, they’re almost back, our great soldiers. Our great soldiers. Countries you’d never even heard about. He’s the embodiment of the political class that enriched itself while draining economic life and soul out of our country.
Yesterday, we learned from newly released emails, and I want to thank the New York Post for showing real bravery, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he has been corrupt for many years and everybody in Washington knew it.
And just now, a little while ago, a new story shows up that Hunter made a deal with a wealthy Chinese business magnet for $10 million a year for introductions only. Introductions. I don’t know, “Will you take 10 million a year to introduce people?” “Yeah to introduce dad. Dad say hello, and by the way, dad give them everything they want. Okay? Give them everything they want dad.”
Hunter also referred to another more lasting and lucrative arrangement with the same Chinese businessman that, “Would be so much more interesting to me and my family,” that’s what he said. That’s a quote. These deals were made at the same time Joe Biden was letting China steal your jobs and take away your factories.
If Biden is elected, the United States will be owned by China, but we don’t have to worry about it because I can’t believe it’s going to happen. He’s shot, just so we understand. We cannot have a leader that’s just about half-shot. Can we believe we’re even fighting against this guy? But you know what? They’re a powerful party. They’re very corrupt party. They’re in bed with the media, the fake news, right back there.
And totally protected by big tech. If I said what he said, they’d be calling for me out of there in 24 hours, what this guy has said. Two days ago, he said, “I’m running for the United States Senate.” That’s the third time he said it, “I’m running for the …” Now, that’s not like a regular mistake. You can make a mistakes. He said that, and then he said other things, but we won’t even get into it. This is crazy. This is the craziest race.
You know what? I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics, and if I lose, it puts more pressure. I wish he was good. I wish he was good, I’d have less pressure. You know what I mean? How do you lose to a guy like this? Like how do you lose to a guy like this? And by the way, we’re leading in North Carolina, a poll just came in. I think we’re leading everywhere where people are intelligent actually. And you actually … We just got a report, the lines are through the roof on areas that would more typically vote for us. I’m trying to be diplomatic when I say that. Thank you. But this election is a matter of national security. It really is. We can’t let this happen. It’s a matter of national security. The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. Now, big tech, you see what’s going on with big tech? Is censoring these stories to try and get Biden out of this impossible jam. He’s in a big jam. You know, his son left his laptop at some place, “Fix my laptop.” He forgot to pick it up. The guy from the laptop, it looks like he saw it. He said, “Wow, this is really criminal stuff.” He brought it to the FBI. Can you believe this?
This could only happen to me and the people of North Carolina, no this could only happen to us. Can you imagine, he’s fixing a laptop? He says, “This is really bad stuff. I think I’ll bring it into law enforcement.” Anyway, they’ve got it. They’ve got a lot of them. I hear they have stuff coming out you won’t even believe, yeah you’ll believe it. He and his family are crooked and they were caught. They got caught. Now they’re being protected by big tech and if big tech persists in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protection. Okay, it’s very simple.
We all believe in freedom of the press, but don’t big tech got something years ago that let them become big tech, they got total protection. They don’t get sued. They don’t get anything, they’re totally protected. So the government gave that, so that takes away that little feeling that, “Oh gee, we can’t talk to them about freedom of the press, et cetera.” No, we’re going to take away their Section 230, unless they shape up.
Believe it or not, even the Democrats agree. Of course, the only problem we have when they say that we’re against, it’s like the wall, you know, we’re building the wall? It’s going up. It was so hard. It was so hard getting that done. There was very few people who could have gotten that done. We’re up over 400 miles, but here’s what’s happened. I just think back. All I had to say is, “We will not build a wall,” they would’ve given me so much money. I had to say we were building it, but we got to going and we have the safest Southern border we’ve ever had so that’s all good.
In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president of the United States who put America first. And we’ve done a job. We’ve done a great job. It’s been amazing. Our comeback, nobody’s ever done anything like what we did, and then we got hit by the China plague. Shouldn’t have let it happen. We’re now coming back at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. Nobody thought it was possible. They thought we’d be at 42% unemployment. We just had 7.8%. Can you believe it?
Now, we were in 3.5%? I even went to North Carolina. I needed a good chief of staff. I said, “Where is he? Where’s Mark Meadows?” Where’s Mark? Where’s Mark? Come here Mark. Come here. Can you imagine? I had to go to North Carolina to find my chief of staff. No, he’s great. No, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job. He followed me and I said, “You know what? I just tested positive.” He didn’t care. He was in that helicopter. Hey, he’s from North Carolina, what can I say? Yeah, he’s great. Doing a great job.
You elected me to restore the principle that’s a nation’s first duty, and it’s to its own citizens. We’re about our country, right? I’m president of our country. We’re not president of the world. We’re not president of the world. The USA. So if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always seem to be playing by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than any other president has ever fought for our country’s people.
Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus and we’re doing really a good job. We’re rounding the turn. You see what’s going on in Europe? It’s flaming up. These characters back there, they say, “Well look at Europe.” Well, I’ll tell you what, go take a look, go take a look. No, we’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job. They didn’t give the credit. I don’t want the credit. But our vice president worked 24 hours a day, Mike Pence. And we had a lot of governors. They worked with us, but we had some that were really good, and some that were really not so good. I’ll let you know one day, I’ll write a little book and I’ll tell you who the good ones were.
We made a lot of people look good. We’ve done a great job. We have some incredible statistics, but we want to rebuild the economy and that’s happening quickly. We had the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Think of it. Now, we closed it down and we saved 2 million lives by closing it down. We closed it down and now we’re building it back up, and by the way, North Carolina, tell you governor, “Open up your state, open up your schools.” Right? Right?
They’ll announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re opening up by North Carolina, and by the way, Pennsylvania.” You know, we’ve been suing a lot of states that are run by Democrats, right? I always call them high crime. But the fact is that’s where the crime is. But we’ve been suing a lot of people and we just won in Michigan against … what she did was terrible. I mean, she did … It’s like a prison warden. So Michigan, we won on a constitutional basis to have to open it up. You got to open this one up. I mean the people want to get back. The kids want to be back in school, 99.9%.
Like you heard yesterday, they announced, my Baron, my tall Baron, he’s very tall. My beautiful Baron, and handsome, he is handsome, but my beautiful Baron had it, he recovered like so fast. I said, “Wait a minute. How long did that take?” They have the strongest immune systems, they’re better than all of us. That’s what they are, they’re kids, for some reason. But we’ve learned about this disease. You got to open up your businesses, open up your schools, get it going.
We have incredible therapeutics, have incredible drugs. We have, in my opinion, a cure because I took something, Regeneron. It was highly sophisticated stuff, the antibodies, and Eli Lilly makes an incredible drug. What we’ve done is incredible. This is all been over the last six months. It’s all happened. We got the FDA for fast approvals. They would have taken years and years and they’re doing it … They came to me on one, “Sir, this will take approximately two years.” I said, “Nope, I needed to prove tomorrow.” They said, “That’s not good.” We got it too. We got it.
But this is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain, in exchange for his party’s nomination, he has handed control of the socialists … I mean he’s given control of this party, the Democrats, they used to be like normal people. Now they’re socialists, Marxists, communists. That’s right. You said it, I didn’t say it, communists. Some people would say far left lunatics. Look at the Green New Deal.
Well, don’t clap too hard. Go out and vote. We’ll clap later because these people are crazy. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country because they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they win, we won’t have our country anymore, and it’ll never be able to come back. They never do.
If you look at 20 years ago, Venezuela had oil, it had wealth, less than 20 years ago, it had everything. Now they don’t have water. They don’t have food. They don’t have medicine. They have nothing but killing all over their streets. This happened in a short period of time and it’s the same ideology. You see it. The Democrat party talks about decency and decorum while they demonize and cancel, you know the word cancel, right? They want to cancel your culture and persecute anyone who refuses to bend to their will. I don’t think they like me too much, do they? They don’t like me too much. That’s really an honor. That’s an honor. You know why? Because those words, nobody has ever heard them at a political event. I liked Ronald Reagan and they’d say, “We like you Ronald Reagan,” but nobody’s ever heard those words, right? “We love you.” No, seriously? What politician has ever heard those words? I’ve never said those words and that happens and I consider that a great honor and thank you very much. Thank you.
But the Democrats smear decent Americans as racist, slander our nation as evil. Indoctrinate our children and incite anti-American riots on our streets that we could control in 25 minutes, as we did in Minneapolis, as we do wherever we go, but they have to invite us in. By law, they have to invite us in. We want to go to Portland so bad. That one would take 15 minutes to set. 15 minutes.
The man that shot another innocent man, this was an innocent man shot, killed, instantly killed. I said, “What happened?” “Well, we haven’t arrested him.” Two days. Three days went by. We sent in the US Marshals, it took 15 minutes, it was over. 15 minutes it was over. We got him. They knew who he was. They didn’t want to arrest him and 15 minutes that ended.
Anyway, and they call themselves peaceful protesters. In theory, we’re not supposed to be … and look at all the masks. They keep saying, “Nobody wears masks, wear the masks.” Although then they come out with things today. Did you see, the CDC? That 85% of the people wearing the mask catch it, okay?
Then you have my friend, and he’s a nice guy, Tony, Tony Fauci. He’s a nice guy. He said, “This is not a threat. This is not a problem.” It’s the craziest thing. Then he said, “Do not wear a mask. Do not wear a mask under any circumstances. Don’t wear a mask. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” Right? So we don’t wear a mask. Then they say, “Oh, wear a mask.” I never saw … Do you ever see any conflicts? But he’s a nice guy. So I keep him around. Right? We’ll keep him around.
He’s a Democrat, everybody knows that. He’s Cuomo’s friend. Cuomo did the worst job of any governor in the United States. Almost 40,000 people died, more, and 11,000 at least, and you know, I gave him this big convention center, 2,800 beds. He didn’t use it. I gave him a ship. I gave him the great hospital ship meant for wars, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of incredible … You have to see the ship. I’ve been on it many times, it’s incredible. They didn’t use it. Instead, they sent sick people back into nursing homes, right? It’s a disgrace. The Democrat party is ashamed of America. The Republican party is proud of America and that’s a big difference. A big difference. Thank you.
So you know, I’m being set up tonight, right? So I’m doing this town hall with a Concast, C-O-N, right? Con, because it’s a con-job, Concast, C-O-N, not C-O-M. C-O-N-cast. So I’m doing it, and it’s NBC, the worst. It’s the home of sleepy eyes, Chuck Todd, and some others. They gave Lester Holt, he’s a beauty. They gave Joe Biden, a week ago, a town hall, and it was meant for children. In fact, speaking of Baron Trump, he fully recovered in like record time, Baron Trump would do great …
Trump fully recovered in record time. Barron Trump would do great on that show, because he’s a young child. They ask him questions that a child could answer, any child, a smart child, not such a smart child. And they got taken apart. It was a joke. It was a joke. And so they asked me if I’d do it, and I figured, what the hell? We get a free hour on television, and we have Savannah Guthrie. She’s always lovely, isn’t she? But I figure, why not? Watch the difference in tone between what they did to this guy, that kid put two sentences together, and what they do to me. But with me, it’s me. It’s a life. We know what we’re doing and we just go on and we do it, but they’re doing him on doing him on ABC. And actually I’d like to watch him because I want to see if he can make it through the program.
And, honestly, they’ll be so soft. George Stephanopoulos, I did him a couple of weeks ago. It was fine. His questions were unfair. They said that the audience is neutral. Turned out that they only had Never-Trumpers in there. But these are minor, little minor facts. Well, that happened with the other guy too. It was supposed to be neutral. It turned out that they were all big Democrats, right? Big Democrats. Because you know what? The fake news media is corrupt. It’s corrupt, and we’ve shown it so many times. So I’ll see you later on NBC, I look forward to it. We’re going to be doing it from Miami, where we’re doing very well in Florida too, by the way. We just got numbers back. Doing very well. And the senior citizens are liking us, I think, more and more every day. Every day, they see what we’re doing. Every single day. But we’re going to be doing that from Florida, so you’ll watch tonight. If you want to have a little entertainment, watch.
Let’s just see. I just want to see the tone of the way they treated this character and the way they treat us. It’s not me, it’s us, the way they treat us. So the candidate whose supporters are burning American flags, and I say all the time, let’s put in some kind of a major, major resolution, you burn an American flag, you spent one year in jail. Do it.
See, that’s where the politicians are weak. The politicians could do this. That’s where they’re weak, the politicians. And I think it lost five to four in the Supreme Court. Now we have a different Supreme Court. Hey, by the way, can you imagine, we’re going to have number three in one term, which is a record, a record. President’s go an entire, Presidency, one term, two terms, without ever having to pick a Supreme Court. I have three in the first term. Their heads are exploding. These people can’t believe it. You know what? Our friends over here, they can’t believe what’s happening, I’ll tell you. But we have three. And how good is Amy? How good is Amy?
It’s happening.
They said, “He should not be able to do this.” I said, “Why? I’m in my fourth year.” “He should not be allowed to do it.” But then they have a quote from Justice Ginsburg talking about, I guess it was Obama, right, that, “Well, wait a minute. He’s elected for four years. He’s not elected for three years.” That didn’t help them. That didn’t help their cause. No, we got it done. It looks like it’s going to be done very soon. They have a one week period where they sit, but they’re getting out of committee and it’s very exciting. And I’ll tell you what, she’s been flawless. She hasn’t made a mistake. She’s toying with those Democrat evil people. They’re evil. The way they treated Justice Kavanaugh was one of the greatest disgraces. I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve watched a lot of unfair things. I get treated that way all the time.
But I want to tell you, I’ve never seen anything like it, the way they went after Justice Kavanaugh with false accusations and everything else. It’s a disgrace, but they’re not playing that card here. They’re not playing that card, at least so far they’re not, but we’ll be watching very closely. But she’s been spectacular. She’s getting rave reviews. She’s a great intellect. Her professor, who was a great professor many years, said the single greatest student that he’s ever had. That meant something to him. It’s always nice. As long as you’re doing it, you might as well put smart people. Now, they’ll say, “He discriminates. He discriminates against others.” No, I like to have smart people on the Supreme Court, and she’s been great.
But the candidate whose supporters are tearing down our statues is not going to deliver any civility. And by the way, we solve every problem. And these are Democrat, radical left usually, but Democrat areas that are having these high crime. The Republicans are doing fantastically well, remember it. No cash bail. They do things that nobody could even conceive of and they’re out of control. But you know what’s going to bring it all together? Success, because we were bringing it all together before the plague came in from China. Should have never happened. They shouldn’t have let it happen. They let it happen. We’re not forgetting. They’ll pay for it. But before the plague came in from China … Well, Biden’s not going to make them pay. He’s going to get cash. They paid his son a lot of money. What’s he going to do? Say, “Hey, you shouldn’t do this.”
And that’s true. That’s common sense. Look at the money they’ve out of China. I’ll tell you what, he really is, he’s a corrupt politician, just remember it. And I’m going to say it more and more, and Facebook and all can try and shut us down. But you know what? Everybody knows it. You don’t have a kid who gets thrown out of the military, hasn’t got a job for a long time, his father becomes the Vice President, and now this kid’s going into every country, walking away with millions of dollars from every country with no talent, no skill, no expertise. And the press doesn’t want to cover it because they’re corrupt. Is that true? I mean, how true is that? And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician’s salary for his whole life. 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place.
I haven’t seen him, but he’s a politician and you’re not supposed to live like you’ve made $20 million a year. So he’s corrupt as hell and everyone knows it. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your job, and that’s what they’ve done. They’ve killed your jobs, dismantle your police departments, and that’s what they’re doing. Dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes by four times. And how about this? How about the fracking? There will be no fracking. That’s when everybody was against, because the super radical left primaries, right? There will be no fracking. Here’s Biden. “No, I said there will be. How many times do I have to say it? There will be no fracking.” Now he gets the nomination. The following day, he said, “No, that will be fracking.” And I said, “Okay, he’s going to get killed by the media on this.” They never even asked him the question.
I hope you’re watching Pennsylvania because you will lose one million fracking jobs almost immediately, because you know what? Joe has no control over that party. That’s all AOC and Crazy Bernie and all these maniacs. But we were coming together really well. I was getting calls from people that normally I wouldn’t want and they wouldn’t want me, and they’re saying, “It’s amazing.” We had the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had. We had 160 million people working. Think about it, 160 million. We were never even close. We were beating China at a level that they’ve never been beaten before. I was charging them tariffs. They didn’t know what the hell to do. And they were always going to overtake us in 2019. If you go back 15, 20 years, 10 years, China was always going to overtake us, 2019. Well, in 2019, we became much, much bigger and we were way overtaking them and they weren’t even close to overtaking us. It was just the opposite.
We were coming together as a country because everything was good. Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, people with diplomas, people without diplomas, people with no high school education, PhDs from MIT, everybody was coming together. And then we had the plague. But that’s going to bring us together again because you had your best year in the history of your state. You had the best year last year in the history of your state. You’re going to have a better year coming up. This is going to be a better year. And watch your third quarter, watch your third quarter. But the radical Democrats will confiscate your guns, destroy your suburbs. I keep hearing about the suburban women. The American dream, it is. I let you have the American dream. I wiped out a regulation that will destroy the suburbs. Do you know that? You know about that. I wiped it out, right? They don’t want to have a project built next to their beautiful house, right?
So why is it that the fake news keeps saying that women aren’t going to like Trump? You know what women want more than anything else? They want safety, security, and they want to be able to have their houses and leave me alone. The suburban woman. And then early on, before I realized it wasn’t politically correct, sorry, folks, haven’t been doing this too long, I said, “The suburban housewife loves Trump.” And by the way, the women, they loved it. Does anybody mind that term? Is that a bad term? The only people that mind it are those people there with the cameras. Look at them. Look how innocent they look, and they’re not innocent. They’re not innocent. The enemy of the people. I call them the enemy of the people. But, anyway, so the suburban women should love Trump. Now, this is the same thing, this is like a carbon copy of what happened last time, not nearly as bad.
Remember, you had nine states. I was going to lose all of them the day before. And they were just wrong a little bit. I won all of them. I was going to lose all nine. They said, “This will be a horrible evening for Donald Trump.” That wasn’t President Trump. That was Donald Trump. “This evening will be over very shortly.” Then we went and Florida. We win North Carolina, by the way. We win South Carolina. We win Georgia. We ran the coast. We just ran it one after another. And remember it said, they had this little crazy chart on NBC, and that’s when the people started crying that worked there. “Oh my God, what am I going to tell my wife after two and a half years of saying, he’s not going to make it.” And remember it said 3%. I had a 3% chance, right? So it’s at 3%. Then we won Utah. Remember, we were supposed to lose Utah. We only won by 22 points. Very accurate. So we win you Utah.
So it goes 3%, 5%, 8%, 12%, 21%. Now they’re saying, “Man, that sucker. That number is getting bad up there, that little number.” Then it started getting smaller, because they made the numbers small, but the number was actually getting bigger. 21%, 25%. Then we won a place called North Carolina. So it went from 25% to 32% right through that evening. Wasn’t that a great evening? Started off with Ohio. Remember, “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” I heard that for a year. And then we won Ohio by 8.7. So everyone said, “Nobody wins it by eight.” By the way, we’re doing better there now that we did four years ago. The great Jim Jordan and all those guys. So we won by eight points and that was the beginning. They said, “Wait a minute. Not only did he win, he won by a lot.” But that was the little signal as to what was happening.
So then it goes to 25, then 31, 35. Now we hit the 42. So now I have a 42 chance of winning. And I’m looking at all these states and I’m leading in most of them, right? We won 32 or 34 States. So it goes 34, 38, and now they’re going, “Oh, what’s going on here?” And remember the guy, John King at CNN. And he’s good with the board. I like it. He’s got nice action. But it wasn’t so good that night. He was shaking And he’s going, “Okay, well, look, this is not looking good. This is not good. I don’t know.” And now he’s a nervous mess. And he’s going, “What’s going to happen?” Who’s there, Heather? Oh, Hemmer, Bill Hemmer. Well, Bill Hemmer’s a good guy, right? Bill Hemmer’s a good guy. Oh, he said, “Hemmer’s better.” I agree with that. Hemmer’s a good guy.
But you know what? It’s very interesting. So then we go from 42 to 48, 54, 60, 64, then 71. This is in our favor. Then 78. Then you see all the people screaming and crying. It was beautiful. The most beautiful convention center. They had that. Remember they had the earth that was shaped like the United States. And they had the podium on the state of Florida out there hanging out over. And I looked, I said, I said to our great First Lady, I said, “First Lady, that is the most beautiful looking thing I’ve ever seen.” The way they had it. They spent a fortune. But they knew something was wrong because they went to Grucci, and they were in the river at the convention center, and they had a big display of 4th of July, whatever the hell it is, the fireworks. And they paid a lot of money. But now they had to pay seven million. They owed $7 million to Grucci and they were all set to do it. And then they decided to cancel.
So I then called up Grucci. I said, “Listen, it’s way far away from my location, but I’ll give you a million dollars.” I tried to buy their fireworks. I figured I’d give New York, have a little fun. But I’ll never forget that beautiful. And it looked so beautiful. Five o’clock, it’s beautiful. They’re all looking like, oh, they’re going to have a big evening. And by eight o’clock in the evening, you watch these people. Remember the woman screaming, you know the one? Screaming. How about her? You think she’s a reasonable person to deal with? And she was screaming, they’re screaming. And they talked about the glass ceiling, right? The woman breaking the glass ceiling. And it didn’t work out that way. The glass ceiling broke her. But there will be a woman that breaks the glass ceiling. It just won’t be Hillary.
And you know what else it won’t be? It won’t be Kamala. Won’t be. It won’t be Kamala. But we worry about her. I’m very concerned about her, because as you probably just heard just before I walked out, two of the people that traveled with her, her chief of staff and somebody else in the plane with her all the time, they have been tested positive for COVID- 19. So we extend our best wishes, right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best, which is more than they did to me. But that’s okay. That’s okay. So let’s see what happens. I mean, it’s a tricky thing. It’s dust. It’s a little tricky thing. Masks, no masks, everything, you can do all you want. But you still need help from the boss. You need help from the boss. That’s what happened. We needed help. Yeah, we needed help. It’s all right to say.
Now, they’ll criticize me for that. “How dare he say that. How dare he say that.” No, I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I’ll say it. Somebody said to me the other day, “You’re the most famous person in the world by far.” I said, “No, I’m not. No, I’m not.” They said, “Yes, you are. I said, “No.” They said, “Who’s more famous?” I said, “Jesus Christ.” I’m not taking any chances. I’m not going to have it. Hey, I’m not having any arguments. Jesus Christ. I’m not going to take any chances, I guarantee. And let me look up and I’ll say and it’s not even close. To defend our Constitution, I proudly nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. It’s been so popular. A lot of people said I got elected because of the United States Supreme Court. I don’t know that it’s true. But when I ran, people knew who I was and all, but they didn’t know too much about my politics. And they figured maybe I’m liberal. Who knows? They didn’t.
And they weren’t happy because they didn’t know who I was going to appoint as a Supreme Court Justice. Was I going to put a radical left person, like he will put? He’s got to give a list, by the way. Not only can he not pack the court, which would be horrible, horrible for our country, for that institution, but he’s got to give a list of 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 that he will only pick from, because people have to be able to see who he is going to pick. You can’t let somebody go up and put a crazy radical left justice in the Supreme Court. So I’m going a step further than them. They don’t press him much. How about if I said what he said? He said, “No, no, I’m not going to say. I’ll tell them after the election.” Oh, that’s great. That’s wonderful. And then these guys walk away. No, no, he’s got to say about packing the court, but he’s also got to say who from what group will he pick?
Give the names because you have to know that. You have to know that. And they say that’s what won me the election. I don’t know if it’s true, but a lot of people say because I came up, and I was having a lot of, when I first went, had a lot of bike back, where people were saying, “Well, wait a minute. Who’s he going to pick as a Supreme Court Judge?” And I said to my people, who are some really great people, I said, “Give me the top 25.” It was 20, and then ultimately expanded to 25 judges, lawyers, group of people. “Give me the top 25 judges, et cetera, in the United States. I want the smartest, the best, the most brilliant, and I’m going to put them in a list.” And I didn’t know, I don’t think, almost any of them, but these are the most respected people. They believe in a thing called the Constitution, which Biden’s people won’t believe in. You’ll see some real beauties if they put in the truth. That’s why they don’t want to do that, because you couldn’t win an election if you had to do that.
So I said, “Give me the top 25,” and then I went out and I played a little bit cute. I said, “All right, I will pick somebody like these people.” And you know what, that didn’t play. They said, “No, you have to pick one of these people, two of these.” And that’s what I did. I said, “All I’ll do that.” And they say that was 20 or 25 points in terms of the percentages of what I got. It was a big thing on the United States Supreme Court. Well, I’ve done it again. I’ve now taken my original list and we had two great people put, as you-
… original list. And we had two great people put as you know, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. And by the way, nobody’s ever suffered like Justice Kavanaugh, what he went through, nobody. But we put Justice, Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. They’re fantastic intellects, fantastic people. And now we have Amy to go along with it and it’s going to be unbelievable. Another week they’ll be voting. The full Senate will be voting. And I don’t know what can stop it because she’s so good. It’s a freight train, okay. But the fact is, so we’ll have three, but you know what Joe Biden has to tell you who. Because the next president, whoever it may be, it better be us, because if it’s not, honestly, you will not have the same country because the next president, the next term will have anywhere from one, two, three, and even four picks, very unusual.
I was very unusual at three. It’s a record for a term, but you know what? The next could have just by statistically one, two, three, or four. So your whole court as good as we’re doing now, and if I didn’t do this, you wouldn’t even have a 2nd Amendment. You wouldn’t have a 2nd Amendment, but if they put on two, three or four, that means they will override. And that’s good for 30, 40, 50 years. And the judges, they go in young and they last for a long time, which is nice. So Biden has to go out and he has to not only talk about not packing the court because anybody who wants to pack the court shouldn’t win. And Justice Ginsburg said that. She said, “No, the nine, we’re friendly, we get together. We’re for the country.”
She made the greatest case for nine. Once you get a big group of people, then you’re into the Senate, you’re into the House. We’ve already got that, right. And this is a great institution, maybe our greatest institution, and we can’t let some radical group of people destroy it. So number one, he can’t pack the court. And number two, he’s got to explain one of 25 or 30 or 40 or 50 people, but he’s got to put up a list of people from which he’ll choose. And the voters have to know who those people are and he can’t get away with I’ll tell you after the election and then destroy our country. He can’t do it. So that’s it. That’s it.
That’s much more interesting than going off a teleprompter when you think of that, but no, but you got to say it. You got to say it like it is. So Bidens’ agenda would be a catastrophe for North Carolina seniors and you know that better than anybody. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. People don’t know that about him, but he tried to cut your Social Security, great genius. He’s going to cut your Social Security and your Medicare. Now Biden’s pledging mass amnesty and free healthcare for illegal aliens. And you saw that three months ago when he’s on stage and he said to all of these very radical left candidates, “Who wants to give illegal aliens free healthcare?” And they all raise their hand and Biden didn’t and then you could see his right shoulder here it was the corpse. I say he’s the corpse. And his shoulder was… He was looking around, he didn’t know what the hell was happening, but he knew everyone else’s hand was up.
Remember that though? He knew it was wrong. Look, he’s been there for 47 years, hasn’t done a damn thing. He’s been there 40… He knew it was wrong, but his right shoulder started moving. And I said, “I just won the election.” I said, “Isn’t that nice?” And you know what? We all have a heart, but what that does is it brings millions of people into our country. They all want to get health care. They want to get education. They want to get all the things that they want to give them and you can’t do it. You can’t afford it, but that’s what they want So we’re not going to let that happen because it’ll decimate Medicare and destroy your Social Security and everything else. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security.
And under my leadership, we’re developing the vaccines and therapies and all of those things and you vote for me, prosperity is happening. Already it’s happening. It’s happening so fast nobody can believe it. We’re the number one country in the world by far for economic comeback and we went down less than any other country. Think of that. Normal life, that’s what we want. We want normal. I don’t want to talk. We want normal. We want to get back to where we were nine months ago, eight months ago. We want to have those football stadiums, those great teams of yours, we want to have people sitting next to each other screaming like crazy. You look at the stands where you have a person and then 20 empty seats. Nah, that’s not it. And we’ll be back. We’re going to be back very soon. Next year will be maybe the greatest economic year, one of the greatest economic years, but maybe the greatest economic year. I think better than last year. Last year was your best. I think we’re going to do better.
And to a large extent, this election’s about many things, but it’s between a Trump recovery and a Biden depression. Because if they get in, they’re going to raise your taxes quadruple. He says it. They’re going to allow millions of illegal aliens in, and they’re going to let regulations, all of the cutting that I’ve done in regulation, which is a number that no president has ever even come close to, whether they were four, eight, or in one case, more than that. They’re going to let all those regulations come back in. And the farmers know what I’m talking about and the tobacco growers know what I’m talking about because you couldn’t even farm your land. You had so many regulations. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate North Carolina’s economy with draconian, unscientific lock downs. He’ll keep you locked down except at a level that you’ve never seen before. You won’t have a state by the time this guy finishes up. Biden’s plan will crush America. My plan is already crushing the virus.
Look at our numbers, look at our numbers. This week, oh dammit. He must have lost his job. He must’ve been a nice guy. I’m sure he lost his job. This week, even the failing New York Times, the poor writer, I read this and I said, “This guy is gone, but I didn’t know him so what the heck.” The New York Times said that, this is the quote, experts are saying, “With genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than anybody ever expected.” How about that? New York Times. That’s right. The writer of that article is gone now, but may he rest in peace.
They don’t want to say that. They’re not happy to hear that because they don’t really have our interest at heart. Our early and aggressive action save so many lives, millions of lives. We pioneered all of these incredible therapies and reduced the fatality rate 80, think of it, 85%. We understand the disease and we have things that work and I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that wants it that has a problem free. And it’s free because it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault and I only hope it works as well on you, but I’ll tell you, I felt like Superman a day later. Here I am. Here I am.
I actually looked at the doctor. He’s here with us now. Great doctors. We had so many doctors. I never saw so many doctors, all geniuses, lowest IQ 187. And they weren’t thrilled. But I looked at them and said, “I don’t know what the hell you gave me, but I want some more of it.” No, it was a transfusion. And it was amazing so we’re going to make that available to everybody. We’re trying to get it immediately approved by the FDA. And Dr. Han is working at the FDA to get it. And hopefully you don’t need it. And for the most part, you won’t need it. I think for the most part, but you need it. We’re going to get it to you, and you’re going to get it and you’re going to get better. And I call it a cure. They call it a therapeutic. I called it a cure, Regeneron.
And they have others that are very similar, great companies. I told you before, Eli Lilly, et cetera. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year. The vaccine will end the pandemic but it’s ending anyway. I mean, they go crazy when I say it. It’s going to peter out and it’s going to end, but we’re going to help the end and we’re going to make it a lot faster with the vaccine and with the therapeutics and frankly, with the cures. So we’re joined today by some incredible warriors and friends of ours, Congressman David Rouzer, where is he? David. David Rouzer. There’s our warrior. How are we doing David? We’re doing okay in this state? You’re doing good. Do you have any competition in the race? Any competition or not much?
I love that. I like when they say, “Not much, sir,” but if they have, I’m always there to help, right. I’m there to help. Thank you, David. Great job. We have a candidate for North Carolina, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Catherine Truitt. Catherine. Great. Great. Thank you. Good job, Catherine. I heard that. Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, who just recovered herself by the way. For anybody that’s sitting, look, they’re all jumping. Oh, she just recovered. Let’s get the hell out of here. No, Ronna’s great. Where is Ronna? Right here. Thank you Ronna. She’s great. She did a great job. She ran Michigan for us four years ago. She did so well. And many, many decades since the Republican won Michigan, and we won Michigan.
I said, “I want that person running the RNC. She’s great.” So Ronna, thank you very much. She just fully recovered from COVID. A lot of people are recovering. People are recovering 99%, 99 plus plus. And now with what you can do, one thing I do say, “Get there early. Get to the hospital early. Get there early.” They can do things. Lots of things, but don’t get there late. Get there early. And North Carolina GOP Chairman, a friend of ours, a great gentleman, Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. Great job. How are we doing? Doing all right? Looking like a good win, right? And are the numbers that big standing online getting ready to vote, right? Bigger than you anticipated? He’s saying the right things. Thank you Michael. No, I hear. It was broadcast today. The numbers are crazy. You know what it’s called? And this is what we’re going to have. We’re going to have a red wave. That’s what they call it.
They don’t want to send in the balance and have the balance thrown away into a dumpster. Who are you for, Trump? Get rid of that one, get rid. This is the craziest thing: they want to vote. Our people want to go and they want to vote. It’s going to be a big, beautiful red wave and let them put in their deal and we’ll check in every one of them. We’re watching very closely where they came from, where they went, how did they get there, right, all this stuff that’s going on. Not a day goes by when you don’t read about what crooked thing is happening, but the red wave will crush it. And those are people that are going to get there on November 3rd and previous to that, the open voting when you can vote, but they’re going to get there and people are talking about it already and you’re seeing that aren’t you? Huh? You’re seeing that. That’s great Michael. That’s great. It’s going to be a lot of fun because there was a landslide. Well, we’re going to see. We’re going to see, but we got a good shot.
No, we’re doing great in Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in Michigan. Doing great in Arizona. I heard some very good numbers just now in Nevada. We’re doing good. I mean, we’re doing good all over the place. And I don’t want to say it too loud because they get all this money. They’ll spend money like crazy, but ultimately, money doesn’t get you there because I spent 25% of what Crooked Hillary spent, right. I spent 25%. And even after I won, they said, “He didn’t do as good a job at fundraising.” I said, “I spent less money and I got criticized that we won.” My father taught me a long time ago if you can win for less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing, right? Good thing. Right Michael? Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we are doing it again. In my first three years, family income increased by $6, 000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of that.
So we did really more than eight times. African American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama, nine times. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment all reached in history, record highs. Highest in history, and we’re getting them all back. They’re all coming back. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. Since the China virus, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. We have never produced jobs at that level and that speed. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half and think of it, 7.8 7.9. That sounds terrible. But it sounds pretty good when they’re telling you about the 42%, right? Because I figured 42, what are you going to do? We have this crazy situation that happened and 7.8%, it’s a pretty incredible when you think about it and we’ll get that way down and it’s going down fast. Well, yeah, just watch this. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in their crisis. It wasn’t a crisis though.
It was not great times, but it wasn’t a crisis. We did it in five months. So they had 30 months and they had the weakest recovery in the history of our country dating back actually to when they started 1929. It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country and then he wants to tell us how to do things. For 47 years, he did nothing. I love these guys. For 47 years he did nothing, now all of a sudden he wants to do all these things that I did already. I could do better. You shouldn’t have let China in. Well, for two months he was saying I was xenophobic because I closed the borders very early didn’t I, huh? Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama Biden recovery. 23 times. Not 23%, 23 times. And these numbers come from the great Larry Kudlow, who’s a good man by the way. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over us for 47 years. Think of it. Biden has waged the decades-long assault on your state against your state’s tobacco growers.
He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was a disaster, TPP, which would have been a disaster had I not terminated. It would have destroyed your state. It would have destroyed manufacturing in our country and he was totally in favor of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. That’s when they took off like a rocket, but not so good anymore. For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of North Carolina workers. He should not be asking for your votes, he should be begging for your forgiveness. That’s what he should be doing. What a job he did. I mean, you go back four or five years, you people were hurting. You were hurting. I have plenty of friends in this state. You were hurting. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders, countries you never heard of. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA.
That’s probably the main reason I ran in the first place. And I made this statement the other day and it sort of made sense to me. If Obama and Biden did a good job, I would have never run. I mean, think. I only ran because they did a horrible job and there was no unity. You had Ferguson. Look at what happened in St. Louis. Look at what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened in Oakland. Look at what happened. There was hatred all over the place. Now they say, “Oh, wasn’t that beautiful.” What they did was they did a terrible job. That’s why I’m your president. Because if they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. I had a very nice life, believe me. And by the way, how many of these rallies have you? Stand up, please. North Carolina. What number is this? Don’t be embarrassed.
Six O?
60. They have a group of 12 women and I see them a lot. And I say, “North Carolina, they remind me of that no matter where we go.” And so 60, that’s a lot, but that’s only about 20%. So you have a long way to… I’m sure their husbands are thrilled. Where are you going? I’m going to, well, at least here you’re close, right?
And you don’t mind, right?
We like him. We like him. Great women. Thank you very much. That’s really nice. Now, that’s really nice. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA, which is just now kicking in and it’s turned out to be incredible for our farmers, our manufacturers. Everyone said it couldn’t be done. There’s no way you could end NAFTA. I ended it. It was one of the worst trade deals ever made. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. We’ve achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our pristine environment. We have the best environmental numbers we’ve ever had, meaning I guess over 50 years because before that you didn’t have too much action, right?
But we have the best environmental numbers, ozone numbers, so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India, all these countries, they’re spewing stuff into the air. I keep telling our people. I say, “I love clean air, but Russia and China,” you look at a map. You have all these spots and India and many others are spewing it in. What do you suggest? Well, we don’t think you should sell straws anymore. Oh, great. Okay. That’s going to help. You ever hear that? The straw, right? And I say, “Okay, the straw is good. That’s a little straw. That’s okay. What about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that’s out of plastic?” Well, we’ll get to that later. These people are crazy. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. So you don’t have to worry about any oil spills in your beautiful land. You don’t have to worry. Look how happy she is. She obviously lives on the water. You don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it…
I don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it so great for energy. We’ve never had energy like we do. We’re number one in the world now by far, and totally energy independent. In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American.
I saw a Biden the other day. He’s standing here like this. And he’s got a sign, “Hire American.” I said, “I’ve been saying that for 15 years.” It’s amazing. And you know this one, when the Tennessee Valley Authority replaced part of its American workforce with foreign workers, I told the board chairman, “Chairman, you’re fired. Out. You’re fired, chairman.” You know what he was making? This had nothing to do with me. He was making $8 million a year. He’s the highest paid government official. Semi-government. It’s like a private, semi-private deal. $8 million a year. And I said, “You’re fired.” And what happened is, as soon as I said that they hired all the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. Mississippi
They’re all back, and they were great. They were great. So we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great. My opponent’s immigration plan is the most extreme in the history of our country. Biden’s plan would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release. That’s catch… A murderer comes over, you catch him. What do you do? Well, not much. Most of them don’t say they killed people. You catch them, you take their name, and you release them into our country. It was a big deal. It sounds easy. I ended it. But you want to see tough? Go through courts, goes through… But I ended it. I ended catch and release.
One of the worst things. Now we release them. You know where we release them? We release them back into their country. We don’t release them into our country anymore. We say, “Congratulations, we’ve got them.” Look at all those people standing up out there. Wow, sorry. Sorry we didn’t get you seats. Well, they’re strong. They’re strong people. They’re from North Carolina. Making every community into a sanctuary city, this is their goal. And suspending all removals of any illegal alien, no matter how bad they are. Murderers, rapists. They have a deal with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. He lost twice. Greatest loser of all time. He lost the first time and he took it, then he lost the second time. Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out, I’d be running against him. That would be okay. I don’t care. There’d be more energy. Smaller base, more energy.
But it happened twice to Bernie. But I would really be watching it very careful because it would be the total nullification of US borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have this country, and what would happen would be our country would be overwhelmed with illegal immigration coming in. Your jobs, crime would go through the roof. And now, as I said, we have the strongest southern border in the history of our country. Over 400 miles of wall.
Wall will be completed very soon. MS-13 and criminal cartels would have rampaged freely all over the country if it wasn’t for ICE and border patrol, so we’ve gotten rid of thousands of MS013. We delivered them back out of our country. We said, “Congratulations. Here they are. You take them. We’re not taking them.” These are some bad people. If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone, and your safety is gone. It’s very simple. Biden has pledged with Bernie Sanders, they made agreement. You know what it is? They all agreed to a thing. We call it the manifesto. My idea. It’s called the manifesto.
He’s pledged to eliminate our requirement that newcomers to our society be financially self-reliant. We want them to be able to make a pledge that they’re not going to take from us, and he’ll provide unlimited welfare, he wants to, for anybody anywhere in the world that comes into our country. I said, “That’s a great idea. Where are we going to get the money, Sleepy Joe?” Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing the wall. We’re up to now 407, I think. 406, 407. We’re doing 10 miles a week. Nobody believes it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US Military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared to more than $1 billion a year, many times what it was. And by the way, all made in the USA. We have the greatest machinery ever made by any nation in history. Russia, China, every one of them. They’re all jealous. What we have is not even to be talked about.
I actually mentioned this in a rally about two months ago and they said, “He’s giving away information.” Now I’m not. I’m telling you something. We’ve got stuff that they dream about, all made in the USA. $2.5 trillion. And you know what? Hope to God… We’ve redone our nuclear. When number one in the world by far. It was going down the tubes. It was old and tired, but hope to God we never have to use it. Remember when I came in? They said, “With his personality, we’ll be in a war in the first week.” Where’s the war? Where’s the way? Remember? You would’ve have been in a war without me, because North Korea, we were going to have a nice nuclear war with North Korea. And now I get along great with him. And everyone says, “Oh, that’s terrible” that I get along. No, it’s a good thing. Getting along is a good thing, not a bad thing. And you get along through strength, not through weakness. You never get along through weakness.
And we launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces, and I never even talked. When I came to North Carolina and talked to you, I never said this. So we actually did more than I promised. I’m the only politician, if you’d call me that. I’m the only politician that actually did more than I promised, because I never talked about the Space Force. I never talked about it, right? And as I sat for a year and I watched and I saw what was going on with Russia and with China and with others, I said, “Wait a minute, we’re going to fall away behind. We can’t do that.” And we launched the Space Force. And Jim Inhofe and some of the people in the Senate were fantastic, and the House. And we got it passed, so we have… First time in 75 years, think of that, a new force. And it’s a big force, and it’s an important one. We passed VA Choice for our veterans and VA Accountability for our veterans. Nobody thought that could happen. 42 years.
And we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate. When I came in, it was a mess. They were all over the place. We took over 100% and we killed the leader of ISIS and founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were after him for 15 years. And we took out the world’s number one terrorist, the mass murder of many American troops and many other troops and many other people, Kasseem Salamoni is dead. And I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous $150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash. Can you believe it? Five plane loads of cash. Figure that one. The Iran nuclear deal, a disaster. And you know the first call I’m going to get after we win? It’s going to be from Iran. “Can we make a deal?” Because their country’s going to hell with the sanctions and all of the things we’ve done, and they want to make a deal.
I said, “Why don’t you wait till after the election?” I said, “But if you wait until after the election, it is going to be much tougher.” But I said, “Wait until after the election,” because you can’t make a deal now. You’ve going to see if sleepy Joe… Because if sleepy Joe gets in you’ll make the greatest deal ever made. And China will own us. Remember what I said. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Got it built. And we got it built, Mr. Congressman. We got it built.
They wanted $2 billion to build it. I said, “Maybe we could do cheaper.” I said to my people, I said, “You know this story. Find something. Maybe we own some land.” We did. It had a building on it. So we were going to spend $2 billion. I said, “Well, let’s renovate the existing building. Is it big enough?” “Oh, it’s too big, actually.” “And how’s the location?” “Much better than the one we were going to buy in Jerusalem.” I said, “Alright, come back with a price.” David Friedman, who’s one of the most successful lawyers. Now he’s the ambassador to Israel. So he calls me up two days later, he says, “Sir, I think we can do it for $350,000.”
I said, “David.” From $2 billion. I said, “Well, what’s the difference between the $2 billion version and the $350,000?” He said, “Sir, honestly the $350,000 will have a better location, a better building. It’s actually better.” Now, who would believe stories like this? And I actually told him, I did something I don’t think, congressman, I’ve ever done in my life. I said, “David, it’s too cheap. It doesn’t sound good. Make it more expensive, please.” So we made it $500,000. Not bad, right? And we opened it up a few months later. So not only did we name Jerusalem, became the capital of Israel. We got the building built. This thing would’ve taken 10 years, 20 years. Would’ve cost $5 billion. It would have been ridiculous. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, they’ve been fighting over that for 52 years.
And instead of endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle-East. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy your social security, and he would destroy all preexisting conditions. And you know it, and so does he. Biden’s running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private healthcare. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He’s agreed to this with crazy Bernie, by 700%. Think of that. Does that sound reasonable? Opening the flood Gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I said, “No, thank you.” He wants to ban school choice and charter schools. And in a second term, and I’ve already started, we will provide school choice to every parent in America. One of the most important things.
A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and limitless future. A limitless future for all Americans. And just in concluding, first of all it’s great to be with you on this gorgeous day. This is beautiful. Been a great state. My granddaughter, you what happened, right? You know the name of my granddaughter? Carolina. Carolina. Am I allowed to say that to South Carolina? Because I love them too. Can I maybe do a… Am okay with that? Can I have your approval? It’s Carolina. Beautiful. Over the next four years, we’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China. We’ve already started, we’re well on our way. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.
We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, foolish, stupid foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Already signed, hits in January 1st. Don’t give Biden the credit for it, please. He won’t even know what it is. He’ll say, “What did I do?” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs at levels that you’ve never seen before. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We’ll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’ll be soon. And NASA is now the number one space center in the world by far. And it was virtually abandoned when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.
We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” And that won’t be changed. They took the word God out of the pledge of allegiance and they got absolutely decimated. They put it back. They said, “No, no we didn’t it.” And then they took it out a couple of other times. That’s the way they’re going, but it’s not going to happen. Not even going to come close. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina.
So again, this is the most important election of our lives, maybe in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get out and vote. The red wave is coming. The red wave is coming. And remember, early voting starts, guess when? Today. So go down there. From Wilmington to Winston-Salem, from Asheville to Charlotte, from Greensboro to right here in Greenville, we inherit the legacy of North Carolina patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We love our nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, and we are returning it faster than anyone ever thought possible.
With your help, your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We’re proud. We will make America safe again, quickly. And we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. Go out and vote.
","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Greenville, NC Transcript October 15",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-greenville-nc-transcript-october-15
Barack Obama,United States of America,2009-08-29,"Today we say goodbye to the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy. The world will long remember their son Edward as the heir to a weighty legacy; a champion for those who had none; the soul of the Democratic Party; and the lion of the U.S. Senate - a man whose name graces nearly one thousand laws, and who penned more than three hundred himself. 
Ted Kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch; the restless dreamer who became its rock. He was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but learned quickly how to brush it off. When they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old Teddy got back in and learned to sail. When a photographer asked the newly-elected Bobby to step back at a press conference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, Teddy quipped, ""It'll be the same in Washington.""
This spirit of resilience and good humor would see Ted Kennedy through more pain and tragedy than most of us will ever know. He lost two siblings by the age of sixteen. He saw two more taken violently from the country that loved them. He said goodbye to his beloved sister, Eunice, in the final days of his own life. He narrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, and experienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible.
It is a string of events that would have broken a lesser man. And it would have been easy for Teddy to let himself become bitter and hardened; to surrender to self-pity and regret; to retreat from public life and live out his years in peaceful quiet. No one would have blamed him for that. 
As tempted more; more able to endure,
As more exposed to suffering and distress;
Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.
Through his own suffering, Ted Kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others - the sick child who could not see a doctor; the young soldier sent to battle without armor; the citizen denied her rights because of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from. The landmark laws that he championed -- the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, immigration reform, children's health care, the Family and Medical Leave Act -all have a running thread. Ted Kennedy's life's work was not to champion those with wealth or power or special connections. It was to give a voice to those who were not heard; to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity; to make real the dream of our founding. He was given the gift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongs as the years would allow. 
We can still hear his voice bellowing through the Senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium, a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights. And yet, while his causes became deeply personal, his disagreements never did. While he was seen by his fiercest critics as a partisan lightning rod, that is not the prism through which Ted Kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prism through which his colleagues saw him. He was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politics prevented differences of party and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect - a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots. 
And that's how Ted Kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time. He did it by hewing to principle, but also by seeking compromise and common cause - not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, but through friendship, and kindness, and humor. There was the time he courted Orrin Hatch's support for the Children's Health Insurance Program by having his Chief of Staff serenade the Senator with a song Orrin had written himself; the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crusty Republican colleague; and the famous story of how he won the support of a Texas Committee Chairman on an immigration bill. Teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only the Chairman that it was filled with the Texan's favorite cigars. When the negotiations were going well, he would inch the envelope closer to the Chairman. When they weren't, he would pull it back. Before long, the deal was done.
It was only a few years ago, on St. Patrick's Day, when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate for my support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote. I gave him my pledge, but expressed my skepticism that it would pass. But when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes it needed, and then some. I looked at Teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off. He just patted me on the back, and said ""Luck of the Irish!""
Of course, luck had little to do with Ted Kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that. A few years ago, his father-in-law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time. Without missing a beat, Teddy replied, ""What did Webster do?""
But though it is Ted Kennedy's historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that we will miss. It was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, ""I'm sorry for your loss,"" or ""I hope you feel better,"" or ""What can I do to help?"" It was the boss who was so adored by his staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party. It was the man who sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imagined that a U.S. Senator would take the time to think about someone like them. I have one of those paintings in my private study - a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who happened to admire it when Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in Washington; by the way, that's my second favorite gift from Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo. And it seems like everyone has one of those stories - the ones that often start with ""You wouldn't believe who called me today.""
Ted Kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children, but John's and Bobby's as well. He took them camping and taught them to sail. He laughed and danced with them at birthdays and weddings; cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy; and passed on that same sense of service and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him. Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down the aisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from Jackie that read, ""On you the carefree youngest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be spared. We are all going to make it because you were always there with your love.""
Not only did the Kennedy family make it because of Ted's love - he made it because of theirs; and especially because of the love and the life he found in Vicki. After so much loss and so much sorrow, it could not have been easy for Ted Kennedy to risk his heart again. That he did is a testament to how deeply he loved this remarkable woman from Louisiana. And she didn't just love him back. As Ted would often acknowledge, Vicki saved him. She gave him strength and purpose; joy and friendship; and stood by him always, especially in those last, hardest days. 
We cannot know for certain how long we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us along the way. We cannot know God's plan for us. 
What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy. We can use each day to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindness and respect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures. And we can strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back on our time here, we can know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings.
This is how Ted Kennedy lived. This is his legacy. He once said of his brother Bobby that he need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and I imagine he would say the same about himself. The greatest expectations were placed upon Ted Kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, but he surpassed them all because of who he became. We do not weep for him today because of the prestige attached to his name or his office. We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who persevered through pain and tragedy - not for the sake of ambition or vanity; not for wealth or power; but only for the people and the country he loved.
""As you know so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss, but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because there is still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us.""
We carry on. 
Ted Kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost. At last he is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the good he did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image - the image of a man on a boat; white mane tousled; smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on toward some new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon. May God Bless Ted Kennedy, and may he rest in eternal peace.

Theodore Roosevelt,United States of America,1903-11-10 00:00:00,"To the Senate and House of Representatives:
It being required by the resolution of the Senate of March 1903, that the approval of Congress shall be given to the Reciprocal Commercial Convention between the United States and Cuba, signed December 11, 1902, before the same shall take effect, I transmit herewith the text of the said Convention as amended by the Senate.
The President of the United States of America and the President of the Republic of Cuba, animated by the desire to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two countries, and to facilitate their commercial intercourse by improving the conditions of trade between them, have resolved to enter into a convention for that purpose, and have appointed their respective Plenipotentiaries, to wit:
The President of the United States of America, the Honorable General Tasker H. Bliss;
The President of the Republic of Cuba, the Honorable Carlos de Zaldo y Beurmann, Secretary of State and Justice, and the Honorable Jose' M. Garcia y Montes, Secretary of the Treasury;
who, after an exchange of their full powers found to be in good and due form, have, in consideration of and in compensation for the respective concessions and engagements made by each to the other as hereinafter recited, agreed and do hereby agree upon the following Articles for the regulation and government of their reciprocal trade, namely:
During the term of this convention, all articles of merchandise being the product of the soil or industry of the United States which are now imported into the Republic of Cuba free of duty and all articles of merchandise being the product of the soil or industry of the Republic of Cuba which are now imported into the United States free of duty, shall continue to be so admitted by the respective countries free of duty.

During the term of this convention, the following articles of merchandise as enumerated and described in the existing Customs Tariff of the Republic of Cuba, being the product of the soil or industry of the United States imported into Cuba shall be admitted at the following respective reductions of the rates of duty thereon as now provided or as may hereafter be provided in the Customs Tariff of the Republic of Cuba:

The present convention shall be ratified by the appropriate authorities of the respective countries, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington, District of Columbia, United States of America, as soon as may be before the thirty-first day of January, 1903, and the convention shall go into effect on the tenth day after the exchange of ratifications, and shall continue in force for the term of five (5) years from the date of going into effect, and from year to year thereafter until the expiration of one year from the day when either of the contracting parties shall give notice to the other of its intention to terminate the same.
This convention shall not take effect until the same shall have been approved by the Congress.
In witness whereof we, the respective Plenipotentiaries, have signed the same in duplicate, in English and Spanish, and have affixed our respective seals, at Havana, Cuba, this eleventh day of December, in the year one thousand nine hundred and two.
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I have convened the Congress that it may consider the legislation necessary to put into operation the commercial treaty with Cuba, which was ratified by the Senate at its last session, and subsequently by the Cuban Government. I deem such legislation demanded not only by our interest, but by our honor. We can not with propriety abandon the course upon which we have so wisely embarked. When the acceptance of the Platt amendment was required from Cuba by the action of the Congress of the United States, this Government thereby definitely committed itself to the policy of treating Cuba as occupying a unique position as regards this country. It was provided that when the island became a free and independent republic she should stand in such close relations with us as in certain respects to come within our system of international policy; and it necessarily followed that she must also to a certain degree become included within the lines of our economic policy. Situated as Cuba is, it would not be possible for this country to permit the strategic abuse of the island by any foreign military power. It is for this reason that certain limitations have been imposed upon her financial policy, and that naval stations have been conceded by her to the United States. The negotiations as to the details of these naval stations are on the eve of completion. They are so situated as to prevent any idea that there is the intention ever to use them against Cuba, or otherwise than for the protection of Cuba from the assaults of foreign foes, and for the better safeguarding of American interests in the waters south of us.
These interests have been largely increased by the consequences of the war with Spain, and will be still further increased by the building of the isthmian canal. They are both military and economic. The granting to us by Cuba of the naval stations above alluded to is of the utmost importance from a military standpoint, and is proof of the good faith with which Cuba is treating us. Cuba has made great progress since her independence was established. She has advanced steadily in every way. She already stands high among her sister republics of the New World. She is loyally observing her obligations to us; and she is entitled to like treatment by us.
The treaty submitted to you for approval secures to the United States economic advantages as great as those given to Cuba. Not an American interest is sacrificed. By the treaty a large Cuban market is secured to our producers. It is a market which lies at our doors, which is already large, which is capable of great expansion, and which is especially important to the development of our export trade. It would be indeed shortsighted for us to refuse to take advantage of such an opportunity, and to force Cuba into making arrangements with other countries to our disadvantage.
This reciprocity treaty stands by itself. It is demanded on considerations of broad national policy as well as by our economic interest. It will do harm to no industry. It will benefit many industries. It is in the interest of our people as a whole, both because of its importance from the broad standpoint of international policy, and because economically it intimately concerns us to develop and secure the rich Cuban market for our farmers, artisans, merchants, and manufacturers. Finally, it is desirable as a guaranty of the good faith of our Nation towards her young sister Republic to the south, whose welfare must ever be closely bound with ours. We gave her liberty. We are knit to her by the memories of the blood and the courage of our soldiers who fought for her in war; by the memories of the wisdom and integrity of our administrators who served her in peace and who started her so well on the difficult path of self-government. We must help her onward and upward; and in helping her we shall help ourselves.
The foregoing considerations caused the negotiation of the treaty with Cuba and its ratification by the Senate. They now with equal force support the legislation by the Congress which by the terms of the treaty is necessary to render it operative. A failure to enact such legislation would come perilously near a repudiation of the pledged faith of the Nation.
I transmit herewith the treaty, as amended by the Senate and ratified by the Cuban Government.

Herbert Hoover,United States of America,1930-12-09 00:00:00,"""I observe that measures have been already introduced in Congress and are having advocacy, which, if passed, would impose an increased expenditure beyond the sums which I have recommended for the present and next fiscal year by a total of nearly $4,500 million, and mostly under the guise of giving relief of some kind or another. The gross sums which I have recommended to carry on the essential functions of the Government include the extreme sums which can be applied by the Federal Government in actual emergency employment or relief, and are the maximum which can be financed without increase in taxes.
""No matter how devised, an increase in taxes in the end falls upon the workers and farmers, or alternatively deprives industry of that much ability to give employment and defeats the very purpose of these schemes. For the Government to finance by bond issues deprives industry and agriculture of just that much capital for its own use and for employment. Prosperity cannot be restored by raids upon the Public Treasury.
""The leaders of both parties are cooperating to prevent any such event. Some of these schemes are ill-considered, some represent enthusiasts, and some represent the desire of individuals to show that they are more generous than the administration or that they are more generous than even the leaders of their own parties. They are playing politics at the expense of human misery.
""Many of these measures are being promoted by organizations and agencies outside of Congress and being pushed upon Members of Congress. Some of them are mistaken as to the results they will accomplish and they are all mistaken as to the ability of the Federal Government to undertake such burdens. Some of these outside agencies are also engaged in promoting political purposes. The American people will not be misled by such tactics.""

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-12-07,"Thank you very much. I appreciate it very much. I want to also thank Matt for the introduction. He's doing an excellent job -- really, a leader. Strong leader. I was also thrilled to announce earlier today that I am nominating, as Matt said, William Barr to take the helm as our new Attorney General.
He's an outstanding man. Bill previously led the Justice Department with distinction as Attorney General under George H.W. Bush, following his unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate. During his tenure, he demonstrated an unwavering adherence to the rule of law, which the people in this room like to hear.
There is no one more capable or more qualified for this role. He deserves overwhelming bipartisan support. I suspect he'll probably get it. I'm honored to be in Kansas City with the incredible men and women of law enforcement -- I've been here a lot over the last couple of months -- the U.S. attorneys, state and local prosecutors, police officers, sheriffs, deputies, and federal agents who keep our country safe.
You keep America safe. And you maybe don't hear it enough, or sometimes don't feel it enough: You do an incredible job. The people in this country know it and they love you. Just remember that. On behalf of a grateful nation, I just want to say that we thank you, we salute you, and we stand with you 100 percent.
All of us. Me and all of us. We're here today to restore one of the most effective crime prevention strategies in America: Project Safe Neighborhoods. This initiative brings law enforcement, community groups, and local leaders together to get the most violent criminals in the most dangerous areas off the streets and behind bars.
After many years of neglect, we are bringing back this lifesaving program stronger than ever before. Today is the first nationwide meeting of Project Safe Neighborhoods in eight years. And here with us is the man who started this visionary project all the way back in 2001, former Attorney General John Ashcroft.
Where is John? Where is John? I've been here a lot lately, John. Huh?
I've been here a lot. That's good. Thank you. Thank you for a great job. I also want to thank two members of my administration who are doing tremendous work: the head of ATF Thomas Brandon and the Acting DEA Administrator Uttam Dhillon. Thank you, fellas. We are also joined by a great representative of the state, Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler -- helps me a lot.
Thank you, Vicky. Thank you, Vicky. Josh. Thank you, Josh.
You know, in life, you never know. You pick somebody -- looks good, sounds good, think he's smart -- and then they choke. I picked the wrong person."" Well, we saw a lot about Josh and we thought he'd be great. And I'll tell you, he had a tough race against a very tough competitor.
You know that. And he was absolutely fantastic. So I just want to congratulate you. And, you know, I keep listening to the fake news that, ""They won the House -- House, House, House."" Nobody ever talks about the Senate. We won the Senate easily. In fact, we picked up two. And that hasn't been done in a long time.
For a person is President, you just -- for whatever reason that doesn't happen very often. And we have the Senate, now, 53 to 47. And we're very proud of that. But you never hear that. You only hear, ""The House, House, House…"" And the nice part about having the Senate is, when you have the Senate, your judges -- you know, we've appointed many, many judges.
We're just about at a record clip -- ever. And by the time I finish, we should have the all-time record, except, of course -- from the percentage basis, you know who the best of all was, right? George Washington. 100 percent. That's the only one that I won't be beating.
I can never beat George. He's tough. I asked that question. I say, ""Who had the greatest percentage of judge picks?"" And so far, I haven't had too many people guess it. But as soon as soon as I say it, they say, ""I can't believe I didn't think of that."" Finally we are grateful to the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, Timothy Garrison.
Where is Timothy. Thank you, Timothy. Great job, Tim. Along with a very well-known person, Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith, for hosting today's event. Thank you very much, fellas. Thank you, Rick. Thank you.
In the two years before I took office, the violent crime rate increased by 7 percent and murders were up by over 20 percent. But we're turning it around very quickly, much quicker than anyone thought possible. At the core of our strategy is restoring respect for law enforcement. And there is nobody that deserves respect more than you people, that I can tell you.
For too long, many politicians and radical activists have been smearing and slandering our police, making life easier for criminals and harder for law-abiding Americans. We will not tolerate attacks on the heroes who protect our streets and defend our communities. We will not allow it to happen.
We will protect those who protect us. And we will believe the right punishment -- and we all do -- for cop-killers is called the death penalty. You have all of the television cameras rolling back there. For me, it's not even a little bit controversial.
You kill a cop and it's called the death penalty, okay? At the same time, we are ensuring you have the resources you need to do your jobs properly. We have added nearly 200 new violent crime prosecutors across the country. We have made more than 600 million dollars' worth of surplus military equipment available to law enforcement that, as you know, the previous administration would not allow you to have.
It was sitting in storage houses and warehouses all over the country getting old and gaining dust -- beautiful stuff. And they didn't like it because it made you look too strong. And I liked it because it made you safe. And now it's been distributed all over the country to the police and you're using it very well and very judiciously and we appreciate it. We increased funding for Project Safe Neighborhoods to $50 million dollars this year and we're asking Congress to add an additional increase for next year.
That will happen. We secured $6 billion in new funding to combat opioids -- the most in history. And speaking of that, Kellyanne Conway is here. A very special person. Where is Kellyanne? Is she around here someplace? Stand up, Kellyanne.
And thank you, Kellyanne. Great job. We've increased the average sentence for drug trafficking to its highest level since 2013. I signed landmark anti-drug legislation that included the STOP Act to help prevent fentanyl from entering our country through the mail service. And at my recent meeting that you all read about three days ago with President Xi of China -- this took place in Argentina at the G20 -- President Xi agreed to criminalize and make all fentanyl in China controlled, meaning it's a controlled substance.
Such a big event. He's agreed to make it a controlled substance and the highest criminality. And that would bring into play, again, the words ""death penalty."" Death penalty. From no penalty to death penalty. And that's the way our meeting went.
And I appreciate President Xi doing that very much because we lose about 80,000 people a year to fentanyl. So now they can send it but, if they get caught, they're going to get the death penalty. I have a feeling you're going to see it go down very rapidly. Very, very rapidly. It's a terrible thing. This year, thanks to the efforts of everyone in this room, I am proud to report a new all-time record for the prosecution of violent crime.
You also prosecuted 15,300 defendants for federal gun crimes, almost 20 percent more than the previous record. In partnership with the federal government, local law enforcement is also making tremendous, historic strides. Here today is Wilmington Police Chief Bob Tracy. Where's Bob? Hi, Bob. Thank you.
When a vicious gang member shot and killed two people in Wilmington last February, investigators used the ATF's ballistic database to match the shell casings to another shooting and bring the killer to justice. Amazing job. Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Over the past year, shootings in Wilmington are down nearly 60 percent and firearm murders are down over 35 percent.
Thank you, Chief Tracy, for your unbelievable work. We're reading about it, we're seeing it, and it really is exceptional. Thank you very much. Thank you. Murders in America's largest cities are projected to drop by more than 8 percent compared to 2016 -- a remarkable turnaround in just two short years.
And you are the ones who have really made it possible. We've given you certain advantages that you didn't have before this administration, but you have made it possible. With us today is U.S. Attorney Maria Chapa Lopez. Maria? Where is Maria? Thank you, Maria. Maria assembled a team from the IRS, the FBI, and Tampa Police to take down a violent street gang in Tampa, Florida.
Thanks to this collaborative effort, 11 gang members are now facing hard time in prison. Maria, great job. We've all been reading about it. Very, very exceptional. Thank you. Thank you very much. James? Thank you very much, James.
James works with schools, churches, family members, and friends to deescalate conflicts and stop violence before it happens. A very dangerous thing he does, but he's not afraid. You're not afraid, are you, James? It's just a day in the office, right? Stand up again, James. That's pretty -- that's not easy.
That's not easy. And James and his team have successfully ended more than 50 ongoing, escalating gun battles between rival gangs right here in the St. Louis. James, great job. It's really incredible, what you do, and everybody in this room appreciates it. Thank you very much. And all over the country, they appreciate it, James.
As part of our comprehensive crime reduction strategy, we are reforming the prison system to help more former inmates get on the right track. We all benefit when those who have served their time can find a job, support their families, and stay the hell out of jail. Right? That's what we want. Stay out of jail.
That's why I have called on Congress to pass the First Step Act, so that more inmates gain the skills they need to become productive, law-abiding citizens. And we've helped them a lot by creating one of the greatest economies -- maybe the best economy this country has ever had. Our jobless rate is now down to 3.7 percent.
And, by the way, in Missouri, I was just told by Josh, it's at 3.2 percent, which is the lowest in the history of the state. So now, when people get out of prison, rather than not being able to find a job, some employers, frankly, are forced to hire people that maybe they wouldn't normally do. And the reports coming back are incredible.
I have one particular person that says it's hired seven people, and he just is thrilled. He can't even believe it. We're giving them a chance. And the economy is maybe -- it's a beneficiary, but it's also one of the reasons that it's working so well. So we're very proud. It's -- a lot of good reasons to have an economy that's so good, but that's maybe toward the top of the list, as far as I'm concerned.
We know it's possible for former prisoners to turn their lives around because their Safe Neighborhood partners really make it happen every single day. Deborah Daniels is the co-founder of Offender Alumni Association in the great state of Georgia. Hi, Deborah.
It's an incredible story. I've read the story. I've seen it. Many of you have seen it. Thank you, Deborah, for giving these Americans a true second chance -- and, in some cases, you could say a third chance -- at a good life. Thank you, Deborah, very much. Thank you.
Nowhere is this cooperation more important than when it comes to enforcing our nation's immigration laws. You've been reading a lot about immigration, haven't you, folks? But we're getting it. We're really getting it. We're being strong on the border. We could use a little help, but we're being strong on the border.
A lot of brave people are working with us on the border. Every day, our brave ICE officers are working with the state and local partners to get some of the world's most violent criminals off our streets, and we get them the hell out of our country. We get them out. Since I took office, ICE agents have arrested over 235,000 aliens with criminal records.
Think of that: Two hundred and thirty-five thousand. And then you have a lot on the Democrat side -- they're saying, ""We don't want to respect ICE. We want to get rid of ICE."" We're not getting rid of ICE. They're going to be with us. They're heroes. They're heroes.
And that includes those charged and convicted of more than 100,000 assaults and over 4,000 murders. Last year alone, ICE and Border Patrol seized more than 2.8 million pounds of illicit narcotics, and we have quadrupled the seizures of fentanyl. And now, with our new deal with President Xi of China, maybe we won't even have to worry about that so much.
I think you're going to see that coming down at numbers that are pretty unbelievable. Removing these deadly poisons and vicious predators from our neighborhoods depends upon partnerships with local communities and their elected leaders and officials. Unfortunately, there are extreme politicians in cities and states around America -- I'm sure you haven't heard about this -- who have issued policies to forbid their police departments from working with federal immigration authorities.
Hard to believe, isn't it? These outrageous sanctuary cities are grave threats to public safety and national security. Each year, sanctuary cities release thousands of known criminal aliens from their custody and right back into the community. So they put them in, and they have them, and they let them go, and it drives you people a little bit crazy, doesn't it, huh?
But it's changing. It's all changing. You look at what's going on in California; many people are demanding that they not be part of a sanctuary city. They don't want sanctuary cities. It's happening by its own. American politicians should protect American citizens, not criminal aliens. Not one more American life should be stolen because of radical politicians pursuing their open borders agenda.
Nearly 100 percent of the heroin in our country comes across the southern border, killing 300 Americans, at least, a week. A week. According to the Council of Economic Advisers, this illegal heroin cost our country $238 billion dollars in 2016 alone. Think of that. And we're talking about a wall for $20 billion, $15 billion.
I could even do it cheaper if I have to, and it'll be better than anybody has ever seen a wall. You're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars and you're talking about a fraction. You would make it up in a month -- a month -- by having a proper wall. You see what's happening.
You see where they're surging and our great people are able to easily handle it. Without the wall, it gets tougher. But you know what? They still handle it. Illegal immigration is a threat to the well-being of every American community, threatening innocent families, overwhelming public resources, and draining the federal treasury.
Congress must fully fund border security in the year-ending funding bill. We have to -- we have to get this done. They're playing games. They're playing political games. I actually think the politics of what they're doing is very bad for them, but we're going to very soon find out. Maybe I'm not right, but usually I'm right.
Like I said, ""I'm going to win for President."" And guess what? Look who's up here now, folks.
We need it more than ever. When you see these caravans of thousands and thousands of people -- they like to minimize it on the fake news, but, you know, you have tremendous amounts of people coming up and it's incredible. And oftentimes, they'll keep the cameras low. I know every trick. They've taught me. I know every trick.
They'll put women and children in the front row and they'll have those cameras nice and low. So number one, it doesn't look like a big crowd. Number two, all you see is women and children. And they say, ""You're such bad people."" I'm ""such a bad person."" But behind that front couple of rows, you got some tough, tough people.
You saw the mayor or Tijuana. He said, ""These are tough people. You talk to them and we end up in fights. These are tough people."" We don't want them coming into our country. We want great people coming in. Some of them would be great people. We need people because we have too many companies coming into our country.
Car companies are pouring in. They're all coming in. A big announcement by Fiat Chrysler the other day: They're going to move into Michigan with a massive new plant. A lot of things are happening. We need people at 3.7 percent unemployment, but they have to be brought in the legal way. And they have to be -- we talk merit.
We want to bring them in through merit. We want people that can love our country and people that can help our country. It's all very simple. To me, it's very simple. Every American citizen is entitled to a safe community and a secure border. Here in the audience today are three trailblazing leaders -- they truly are -- who are working to dismantle MS-13 over the past two years.
They've helped so much. They've done such an incredible job. Twenty-nine MS-13 members have been charged and convicted just recently, despite being targeted for retaliation. These three patriots are U.S. Attorney Zach Terwilliger -- where is Zach? Hello, Zach. Herndon Police Sergeant Claudio Saa.
Thank you, Claudio. Thank you very much. And Fairfax County Police Detective Ray Betts. Thank you. All three, thank you very much. As President, nothing is more important than protecting the security of our nation and its citizens. So to every federal law enforcement officer who is on the frontlines of that mission; to the U.S. Marshals; ATF agents; immigration officers; FBI; DEA; and all state and local authorities who proudly wear this incredible uniform -- it's really the uniform of our country -- I say, ""Keep up the great work."" You know that my administration will always have your back.
We will never ever let you down. In the most hazardous moments, in the high-speed chases and the high-stakes courtrooms, in darkened alleys and late-night stakeouts, you are always there and always keeping watch over us. Our people love you. They love you. You don't hear it, but they love you.
You bring criminals to justice and peace to our streets. You are the reason Americans sleep soundly in their beds at night. And you are the ones making America stronger and prouder and safer and greater than ever before. We are making America greater than ever before. We are respected again as a nation. We love our law enforcement.
I just want to thank you all for being here. It's my great honor to be before you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you all. Thank you very much. Thank you.
",Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the Safe Neighborhoods Conference in Kansas City,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-law-enforcement-kansas-city-december-7-2018
Bernie Sanders,United States of America,2019-09-12,"We are in a struggle for the future of this country.
Let me be blunt and tell you what you don’t hear much about in Congress, or in the media, and that is it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country. We must do more. We must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country. As president, I am prepared to take them on. Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has healthcare as a human right, not a privilege. Yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.
Joe said that Medicare for all would cost over $30 trillion. That’s right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for all is the most cost effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman, and child in this country. I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so, intend to eliminate all out of pocket expenses. All deductibles. All copayments. Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we’re going to stand up to the greed, and corruption, and price fixing of the pharmaceutical industry. We need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. To tell you how absurd the system is, tonight on ABC, the healthcare industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for all is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.
Let us be clear, Joe. In the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians, or any other major country on earth.
Yeah, but Americans don’t want to pay twice as much as other countries, and they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare for all proposal, when you don’t pay out of pocket, and you don’t pay premiums… Maybe you have run into people who love their premiums. I haven’t. What people want is cost effective health care. Medicare for all will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.
George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they go unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for All is comprehensive healthcare, covers all basic needs, including home healthcare. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So if you want comprehensive healthcare, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than 200 dollars a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is a way to go.
As a matter of fact they will with our bill.
One minute, George?
All right. Two points. You got to defend the fact that today, not only do we 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that 500000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they’re going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease. Cancer or heart disease. Under my legislation people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer, and our program is the only one that does that.
No, but what I would support absolutely is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about. Medicare for all, climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen. And you could do it in a variety of ways. You could do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will in fact tell the senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is an order and what is not.
But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Corey and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system. And that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what’s happening in Washington or in this case you got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership. I am proud that year after year I had an F rating from the NRA and as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.
There is a reason why in the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and work or productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago. And one of the reasons is that for decades we have had disastrous trade policies.
And I got to say to my good friend Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade. I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over four million good paying jobs. And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50% of what they made in manufacturing.
So Trump obviously hasn’t a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at three o’clock in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere. We’re losing billions right now because of Trump’s policy. A trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad and then thinks they’re going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming.
David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the vice president said. You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq.
I voted against the war in Iraq and helped lead the opposition. And it’s sad to say, I mean, I kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war.
As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said, we cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump’s military budgets. I don’t think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we don’t even know who our enemy is.
I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together, bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism, and make it clear that we, as a planet, as a global community, we’ll work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies, and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism. But dropping bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.
Well, first of all, let me be very clear. Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant. What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future.
In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe, is extremely unfair. I’ll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right. I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave. I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage, and that we expand the trade union movement.
I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means, is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge, not in the media, and not in Congress. You got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies, and in the media.
… is creating an economy that works for all of us, not 1%. That’s my understanding of democratic socialism.
Guess what? You’re guessing. All right, here’s the answer. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth. We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can’t work two or three jobs to support themselves, which is why under my legislation we’ll move to see that every teacher in America makes at least $60,000 a year.
What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K, we will make public colleges, and universities, and HBCUs debt free. What we will also do, because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need, we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.
We are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.
I’d say that resilience to me means growing up in a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George, running for US Senate in Vermont and getting one percent of the vote, running for governor and getting two percent of the vote. Finally, becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont with ten vote margin.
What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex. I feel confident that given a lifelong record I’ve taken on powerful special interests of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that works for all of us. Not just the one percent.
",September Houston Democratic Debate Transcript – Third Debate,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/democratic-debate-transcript-houston-september-12-2019
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-10-16,"Well, thank you very much, everyone. It's an honor to have you all at the White House. You hear that beautiful music in the background? Normally, we wait until it ends, but you're Italian; we move fast, right. Tonight, we celebrate the extraordinary friendship between Italy and the United States.
And we honor the faith, courage, and countless achievements of our incredible Italian-American community. Those people in that community have done so much for our country. We are grateful to be joined by a very special man -- a highly respected man in Italy and far beyond -- President Sergio Mattarella of Italy.
. Laura, would you like to come up? Please, come up. Please. Come on up, Laura. Thank you. Great. And thank you both for coming today to reaffirm the powerful bonds between our people. I want to thank the many amazing members of my Cabinet, hardworking members of Congress, members of both Italian and American diplomatic missions, and many other distinguished guests with us tonight.
We have so many. Senator John Barrasso is here someplace. John? We have Senator Joe Manchin. Where is Joe? Joe? You're not Italian, are you, Joe. What percentage Italian, Joe? Huh?
Well, that's half. Well, I knew I liked him for a reason, huh. Kellyanne, you're half, right?
And she's great. Your mom. House GOP Whip, Steve Scalise. Steve? Where is my Steve. Representative Mark Amodei. Mark? Where's Mark? Thank you, Mark. Representative Jeff Fortenberry. Representative Virginia Foxx. Representative Greg Gianforte. Hi, Greg.
I hear you're doing well out there, huh? I hear -- I hear, he's good. Great man. Representative Doug LaMalfa.
Doug?
He's all Italian. He's all Italian. Carol Miller? Yeah, she's got a little piece of Italian in there someplace. Brad, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Brad.
Secretary Alex Azar is here someplace. Alex? Thank you, Alex. How we doing? Cures for everything, right? He's finding more cures for problems. You're doing a great job and you're getting drug prices down. Secretary David Bernhardt. David. Thank you. Thank you, David. He's the biggest landlord in the world right now.
. From the Mississippi, right over to the rest. Great job you're doing. Secretary Ben Carson. My friend, Ben. Thank you, Ben. He's my friend. Listen to that. They're all jealous now, Ben.
I said, ""What do you know about housing?"" ""Not too much."" ""Would you like to head HUD?"" And, you know what? He did a great job. Better than the people that knew a lot. Right, Ben. Secretary Betsy DeVos. Betsy, thank you Betsy. Good job. Good job.
. He's got more things that he's negotiating. Robert, thank you. That's good. It's really incredible. Now we're getting it papered out, but they're starting to buy all of that farm product anyway.
Great job. Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Treasury. Hi, Steve. Thanks. Now, you I know don't have too much Italian in you, Steve. I'm pretty sure about that. But he loves the Italians. He's done a fantastic job. Thank you, Andrew. Great job. Thanks to have you.
A brand-new Secretary. Somebody that's so respected and -- in Labor -- but one of the most successful lawyers in the country. And he gave it all up to be Secretary of Labor. Just got confirmed with a very good margin, meaning he won by about five or six votes -- which, today, is considered a landslide, okay?
. Today, those -- those days are gone. But if you win by as many votes as you did that's a great testament to you. Eugene Scalia, thank you. Great. Congratulations. Secretary Elaine Chao, one of my favorite people. Where is Elaine?
Hi, Elaine. And Secretary Wilbur Ross. But I want to thank you all for being here very much. And our nation and our civilization have been profoundly enriched by Italian faith, courage, creativity, brilliance, and spirit.
The timeless legacy of the Roman Republic -- what two beautiful words, ""Roman Republic"" -- influenced nations around the globe to pursue the ideals of citizenship, representative government, and the rule of law. Sounds so familiar, doesn't it? The Italian Renaissance opened new horizons of human endeavor and uplifted the world with immortal works of genius.
And when I go to Italy and I look and I see, and I see the greatest artists in history. Michelangelo carved life into marble, and da Vinci inspired wonder with feats of divine beauty. You just don't see it anywhere else, to that extent. Through the centuries, Italy gave us everything from Galileo's telescope, to Verdi's opera, to Versace's fashion, to the voice of my friend -- he was a great friend of mine -- Pavarotti.
He was a diva. He was the greatest of all divas. He was a male -- he was a male diva, but we loved him. And the young man that just sang, it reminded me so much -- his voice reminded me so much of Luciano. And the cars of Lamborghini and Ferrari. Think of what you've done. Think of it -- how brilliant it is, artistically.
From the hallowed dome of Saint Peter's, to the beautiful frescos of our own Capitol Building, the Italian heritage has wonderfully shaped all of our country. Indeed, our name, ""America,"" is derived from the great Italian navigator and mapmaker, Amerigo Vespucci. That's right.
. We love Columbus Circle in New York. And Columbus, Ohio -- what a great place that is.
And as long as I have anything to say about this -- and I hope that's going to be a long time -- it will always be Columbus Day.
You come from a great, great community. Great achievers. Great people. Italian-Americans have invigorated every aspect of our society, culture, and history, from Frank Sinatra -- a friend of mine; to Frank Capra; from Joe DiMaggio -- he was a great player, great player; to Vince Lombardi -- what a coach; and from Mother Cabrini, to the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, the father of Gene.
."" Right, Gene. Countless Italian-Americans have answered the call to defend our nation in uniform, serving in every war and every branch of our armed forces. Among those we're honored to have with us tonight, the first Marine to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a proud Italian American: General Peter Pace.
Peter? Where are you, Peter? Peter. Great. That's fantastic. The Chairman -- that's a big position, Peter, right? That's a great position. We have a great new Chairman, now, as you know. I want to thank you, Peter, for being here and heroism on the battlefield, your lifetime of service to our nation.
Thank you very much. This evening, we're also thrilled to be joined by another very special guest -- an Italian-American legend who truly knows about winning and he knows about speed. I had the privilege of being driven by him one day along -- we were doing a show along Central Park West. He took off in a car -- four blocks.
We covered the blocks in about one second. And I said, ""Get me -- get me out of here. But it was a seriously fast and I'm very happy to be with you tonight. His family immigrated to the United States in 1955 with just $125 dollars to their name.
As a boy, he dreamed to be like his heroes in Formula One racing. And sure enough, he grew up to be one of the fastest men alive, one of the greatest racers of all time. He is the only driver in world history to win the Indy 500, the Daytona 500, and the Formula One World Championship. Not bad. I guess he likes speed.
He has 111 career wins in races all across the globe, which has to be a record of some kind. That's a lot of wins. That's a lot of non-choking. There's no choke when you win that much. A lot of people choke. He doesn't choke. He is a legendary racecar driver, and somebody that's very special in the annals of sport, Mario Andretti.
. Come up, Mario. Come up, Mario. There he is. Boy, you look good, Mario. You remember you took me on that ride? I said, ""Get me out of here."" He said -- we were together. I said, ""Mario, get me out of here. I want to get out of this car."" We went so fast.
We literally -- we covered four blocks in like a second."" He wanted to go faster. I said, ""We did it enough."" That was for ""The Apprentice."" We had fun. Say a few words to your friends, please. Thank you, Mario.
That's great, Mario.
That's right.
Absolutely.
Do you remember that day?
I'm not sure I want to watch.
No, he didn't.
One hundred and eleven wins -- think about that -- for speed. And that has to be in your blood, Mario, right? Let him say hello to the President. Hey, Mario, so when you have 111 wins, that's in your blood, right? It's got to be in the blood. Can you do that if you don't like going fast, huh?
Yeah, you get -- you get a driver, that's the way you do it, right. Stay up here if you'd like, Mario. Thank you very much. To all Italian-Americans in the room and across our country: Again, thank you for uplifting our communities, thank you for strengthening our nation, and thank you for everything you've done to unleash American greatness.
You're an amazing group of people. I know so many people in the room tonight. We have so many successful people, great people. As many of you know, our guest of honor tonight, President Sergio Mattarella, entered politics to combat the mafia -- that means he's tough; that's a tough deal -- and spent much of his career rooting out corruption.
He is a crime-fighter and a patriot -- two things we love in America. He's also the first Sicilian President of the Italian Republic. President, we are delighted to have you both with us at the White House. And I really have a lot of respect for you. We spent the day together. It was a wild day.
He said, ""You know, your news conferences are tougher than most. They go in for the kill -- the fake news back there. Every question is a kill. But he got it. He's a pro. He's really amazing. He's an amazing guy. And I'd like to invite you up, Mr. President, to say a few words. Please.
Thank you very much. And, Mrs. Scalia, thank you very much. A special woman. I just spotted you. Thank you.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Hosts a Reception in Honor of Italy at The White House,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-reception-italy-mattarella-october-16-2019
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-05-25,"Thank you. Thank you. Hello, midshipmen, hello. Let me say to the entire brigade—please be at ease—enjoy yourselves, because we are all here to celebrate the amazing class of 2018. Amazing job.
Thank you. Really something. Admiral Carter, thank you for that wonderful introduction and for your leadership, an incredible job you have done at this storied academy. And thank you, Captain Chadwick, for your dedication and service. Thank you to Undersecretary Modly, Admiral Richardson, General Walters, for joining us today.
Thanks also to Senator Wicker, Congressman Wittman, Congressman Valadao. I want to recognize the entire brigade for a tremendous year. This has been a spectacular year for you. I have heard all about your achievements.
And a very special recognition for the midshipmen fourth class, you are plebs no more. To all of the distinguished faculty and staff, to the local sponsor families, and most importantly, to the parents and grandparents and family members who have helped our graduates reached this joyous hour, today is your incredible achievement also. They would have never made it without you, know this.
I want to thank the midshipmen and your families, and thank you. America thanks you more than anybody. You have done a spectacular job. Thank you very much.
Finally, to the men and women about to be commissioned as ensigns in the Navy and second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, let me say on behalf of the entire nation, we could not be more proud of the United States Naval Academy Class of 2018. Thank you. Great job. Congratulations to you all.
Four years ago, each of you made the most important decision of your lives. You chose the path of hard work, sweat, and sacrifice. You chose the life of honor, courage, and commitment. You chose to serve the nation and defend our great American flag. You chose the Navy, blue and gold, from the first moments of induction day. Through a grueling six weeks of pleb summer, you endured and you persevered.
And then the rest of the brigade returned, and the real test began. You developed morally, mentally, and physically. You poured yourselves into military tactics, seamanship, navigation, ethics, and engineering. And when hard work was not enough, like generations before you, you gathered your pennies and sought favor from the all-powerful Tecumseh. All-powerful. A little bit different. Others worked hard for their demerits at McGarvey's and the Fleet Reserve Club.
And so today in keeping with tradition, I declare that all midshipmen on restriction for minor offenses, you are hereby absolved. That sounds like a lot of people. The Admiral will define exactly what that means, so Admiral, please go easy. This is a great group of people here, Admiral.
I am told this class led Navy athletics to the highest win percentage in your 172-year history. Think about that. That includes taking the Army–Navy Star Series for the fourth straight year, a remarkable achievement in sport and athletics. And because you care about every contest against Army, for the record, this year, Navy beat Army 19 times.
And I will not mention, I promised, who won the football game. I will not mention it. I refuse to say it. But that is a great achievement. And let me take a guess, you are still not tired of winning. Winning is such a great feeling, isn't it? Winning is such a great feeling.
Nothing like winning, you got to win. In every endeavor, the class of 2018 has shown its metal and it's proved its might. You have earned your place in the ancient league of sailors and shipmates, captains and commanders, warriors and mariners, and Marines. You crave adventure. Hello, folks, back there.
You chase discovery, and you never flinch in the eye of a raging storm. America is in your heart. The ocean is in your soul. The saltwater runs through your veins. You live your life according to the final law of the Navy. The word impossible does not exist, because Navy never quits. You don't give up. You don't give in. You don't back down. And you never surrender. Wherever you go, wherever you serve, wherever your mission takes you, you only have one word in mind, and that's victory.
That is why you are here. Victory. A very important word. You are now leaders in the most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet. The United States military. And we are respected again, I can tell you that.
We are respected again. A lot of things have happened. We are respected again. For the last four years, you have walked the same paths as Navy's greatest legends, the giants of Midway and Coral Sea and Manila Bay. Here in Annapolis, the glorious past is all around you, and so are the stories of your great heroes.
One such hero who appears in the pages of your old yearbooks is Bruce Voorhees. Well-known all over. Bruce hailed from Nevada and was a member of the Naval Academy class of 1929. Beneath his picture in the 1929 Lucky Bag, Bruce's classmates wrote that he spent most of his time teaching the city slickers from the east the correct pronunciation of Nevada.
And I had to learn that, too, to win the state. Great place. He saw studying as an unnecessary evil, and they remembered in three cruises and four years in blue-serge brass buttons, he left a trail of broken hearts extending the full length of both coasts and radiating for miles around. Crabtown.
In other words, he was just like you in many ways. Just like you. Not a lot of difference. Just over a decade after his graduation, Lieutenant Commander Voorhees found himself at war.
Seventy-five years ago this summer, he was in the South Pacific commanding Bombing Squadron 102 during the battle of the Solomon Islands. That was a rough battle. His only brother had been killed and the Bataan Death March. On July 6, Bruce volunteered for a mission to destroy a crucial enemy base. It was a rough time. It was a rough, tough situation. He knew full-well that he would likely never return. He knew he was going to die. But he also knew his daring action could prevent a surprise attack on large-scale American forces. So, his plane took off alone on a 700-mile flight. Bruce flew through the darkness to his target, a tiny speck on the vast open sea.
He braved unrelenting anti-aircraft fire, like nobody had ever seen at that time, and a trail of enemy planes to single-handedly destroy this large enemy base, including multiple fortifications, and a critical communications link. And in this final act of valor, Bruce was caught in the blast of one of his own bombs and perished in a remote lagoon very far from here. His life was lost, but his legacy will live forever. Many of you have seen his old room at Bancroft Hall, commemorating his Congressional Medal of Honor, our highest honor.
Some here today will trace his path to Pensacola to earn your wings. You may even make it all the way out to the legendary combat-training school known as Top Gun in bruce's beloved hometown in Nevada. There, you will have the honor to take flight from the Voorhees Field, and remember a hero who fought for his country, and died for his homeland, and saved so many lives with his bravery. Each of you inherits the legacy of the heroes who came before you.
It's a living history passed down from officer to officer and generation to generation. Each of you will make your own mark on the Navy, the Marine Corps, the military, and the history of our great nation. Seize today and you will shape tomorrow. In a few moments, you will be commissioned into the mightiest fighting forces of the air, the land, and the sea. Together, you will blast off carriers of which we are just now finishing, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, and launch off submarines of which we have many under construction, and ward off evil.
You will bring comfort to our friends and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. Among our graduates today will be 283 naval aviators, 134 submariners, 256 surface-warfare officers, 70 restricted-line officers, and 15 explosive-ordnance-disposal officers. Two-hundred-and-thirty-six United States Marines, and 35 very tough, very well conditioned Navy SEALs. Together, you are the tip of the spear, the edge of the blade, and the front of the shield defending and protecting our great country.
You know, there is no mission our pilots can't handle. There is no hill our Marines can't take, and there is no stronghold the SEALs can't reach. There is no sea the Navy can't brave, and there is no storm the American sailor can't conquer. Because you know that together, there is nothing Americans can't do.
Absolutely nothing. In recent years and even decades, too many people have forgotten that truth. They have forgotten that our ancestors trounced an empire, tamed a continent, and triumphed over the worst evils in history. In every generation, there have been cynics and critics that try to tear down America. But in recent years, the problem grew worse. A growing number used their platforms to denigrate America's incredible heritage, challenge America's sovereignty, and weaken America's pride. We know the truth, will speak the truth, and defend that truth. America is the greatest fighting force for peace, justice, and freedom in the history of the world.
And in case you have not noticed, we have become a lot stronger lately. A lot. We are not going to apologize for America. We are going to stand up for America. No more apologies. We are going to stand up for our citizens. We are going to stand up for our values. And we are going to stand up for our men and women in uniform. Because we know that a nation must have pride in its history to have confidence in its future.
We are the nation that built the highways, the railroads, the Empire State Building in one year, the Golden Gate Bridge, and we are the nation that built the Panama Canal. We trekked the mountains, explored the oceans, and settled the vast frontier. We won two world wars, defeated communism and fascism, and put a man on the face of the moon. We cured disease, pioneered science, and produced timeless works of art that inspire the human soul. And on distant islands, far-away battlefields, above the skies and beneath the sea, the entire world has borne witness to the unstoppable strength, skill, and courage of the United States Navy and the American Marines. Each of you enters service at a truly exciting time for our country.
For we are witnessing the great reawakening of the American spirit and of American might. We have rediscovered our identity, regained our stride, and we are proud again. Prosperity is booming at home. Our economy is the strongest it has ever been. And our country has regained the respect that we used to have long ago abroad.
Yes, they are respecting us again. Yes, America is back. We have begun the great rebuilding of the United States military. We have ended the disastrous defense sequester. No money for the military? Those days are over. And we have just secured, you have read all about it, a $700 billion, largest-ever amount of money to support our great war fighters. And I might add that next year—the $700 billion, not million. They're liking the sound of million, but billion is better—the $700 billion goes to $716 billion, and we are going to be stronger than ever before.
We will have the strongest military that we have ever had, and it won't even be close. And when did we need it more than now? That means new ships. You like that. We have now the lowest number of ships we have had since World War I. And very soon, we are going to get to 355 beautiful ships. That is almost a couple of hundred more ships.
So you will be around for a long time. We are not running out of equipment. We're not running out of ships. And that has been approved. And we are honored by it. You are going to have new equipment, and well-deserved pay raises. We just got to a big pay raise for the first time in 10 years. We got to a big pay increase, first time in over 10 years. I fought for you. That was the hardest one to get.
But you never had a chance of losing. I represented you well. I represented you well. And this week, we passed new landmark legislation to give more choice and better care to our great veterans. We are going to take care of our veterans. We are doing a great job with it. We are taking care, finally, after decades, we are taking care of our veterans. We passed VA accountability. Everybody said it could not be done.
If you didn't do a good job, you could not get fired. Now, you don't do a good job and take care of our veterans, they will look you in the eye and they say, ""Jim
We will say, ""Get him out of here
We are reestablishing the second fleet in the Atlantic: bigger, better, stronger than it has ever been before. We are rebuilding our defense industrial base to forge American iron, aluminum, and steel, which, by the way, we just put tariffs on when it comes in from other countries. Okay? We are taking in a lot of money now, our country. They pay that big, beautiful tariff and it goes right into building new ships.
We have been taken advantage of by the world. That is not going to be happening anymore. You see what is going on. So, we are building a modern fleet manned by the greatest sailors. We're sharpening the fighting edge from Marines infantry squads to combat ships to deliver maximum, lethal force. The enemy has to know we have that. We are recommitting to this fundamental truth: We are a maritime nation. Being a maritime nation, we are surrounded by sea.
We must always dominate that sea. We will always dominate the oceans. We are showing what we can achieve when natural American confidence is backed by unrivaled American power and unquestioned American resolve. Also, there is another word that's never used, and I will use it today.
It's called talent. We have talent and a lot of other people don't, and a lot of other countries don't. We have great talent and I have seen it. In other words, we are showing what is possible when America starts acting like its sailors and Marines. Our nation cannot be strong without the heroes whose hearts stir the words: Don't give up the ship. Famous phrase.
We even use it in business. Things are going bad, you say, ""Don't give up the ship."""" Keep fighting. Don't give up the ship. But it's really—you guys started it. Our country cannot prevail without those who rally to the famous cry
You hail from every background and you come from every walk of life. But each of you is formed by the same defining choice, to answer the call. You all share the same heart, the same blood, and swear by the same motto: Not for self but country. It's a great motto. With us today are living symbols of that long and unbroken chain of American patriots, members of the Naval Academy class of 1968.
That's great. Stand up, please. Exactly 50 years ago, they were in your shoes. They embarked into service and they made America very proud.
To everyone in the class of 1968, we thank you and we salute you. Like those who came before them, today's graduates will serve America through times of triumph and some hours of peril. There will be hours of peril. You will face new challenges, even challenges that you can't envision, but you'll find new solutions that nobody can even imagine. Among your ranks is the next Chester Nimitz, the next Grace Hopper, the next John Lejeune.
Future generations will talk about you. They will tell your stories, speak of your courage, and someone many years from now will be standing right here, in my position, paying tribute to your great service. It will happen. Because you already know the keys to success.
You know that as long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, we will not fail. We will not fail. We cannot fail. We will always succeed, always. As long as we are united with the same mission, the same purpose, the same patriotic heart, we will win, because we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. Together we struggle.
Together we strive. Together we pray. And together we triumph as citizens, as patriots, as Americans. We stand on the shoulders of heroes who gave their sweat, their blood, their tears, and their very lives for this great country of ours. This is our heritage.
This is our home. And this is our pledge. We are all in for America, like never before. We are all in for our great country. So to the Naval Academy of the class of 2018, I say a number of things. Number one, I say that I was given an option.
I could make this commencement address, which is a great honor for me, and immediately leave and wave goodbye, or I could stay and shake hands with just the top 100, or I could stay for hours and shake hands with 1,100 and something. What should I do? What should I do? I'll stay. I'll stay. I will stay. But to the class of 2018, I do say strive for excellence. Live for adventure. Think big. Dream bigger. Push further. Sail faster.
Fly higher. And never, ever stop reaching for greatness. Never stop reaching for the stars. You know you're up to the task. You're among the finest people anywhere in the world, the smartest, the strongest. You know you will make us proud.
We know that glory will be yours because you are winners. You are warriors. You are fighters. You are champions, and you will lead us only to victory. Good luck. May god be with you. God bless America, and anchors away.
",Speech: Donald Trump Delivers Speech at U.S. Naval Academy Graduation,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-naval-academy-graduation-may-25-2018
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-04-26,"Thank you. Thank you. Well, I want to thank Chris and Wayne. I'm thrilled to be here in Indiana with the men and women of the NRA. You are great American patriots. Chris Cox, Wayne LaPierre, Oliver North -- I've been following Oliver for a long time. Great guy. Three extraordinary champions for the Second Amendment.
And I'm a champion for the Second Amendment and so are you. It's not going anywhere. It's under assault. It's under assault but not when we're here. Not even close. I also want to thank our tremendous Vice President and Indiana's native son. Mike Pence has done a fantastic job. And we're grateful to be joined by a number of terrific leaders from the Hoosier State: Governor Eric Holcomb.
Where is Eric? You can't miss Eric. He's so big. Thank you, Eric. Senator Todd Young, terrific guy. Thank you, Todd. Senator Mike Braun. What a job he's doing. And Representative Greg Pence -- familiar name. Thank you, Greg. Jackie Walorski. Jackie, thank you.
Jim Baird and Jim Banks -- great representatives. Thank you all very much. Tremendous help. Tremendous. I also want to recognize Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt. What a job he's been doing. David, thank you. Thank you. A great friend of mine, Kentucky Governor, Matt Bevin.
Thank you, Matt. And the House GOP Whip -- a man with more courage than most of us here today. He took some very, very severe shots -- you know that -- by a madman. And he's stronger and better. I actually told him backstage, I said, ""You're much more handsome than you were two years ago."" I don't know what's going on. And he is. Steve Scalise.
A lot of courage. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. Most importantly, I want to thank all of you, the proud, card-carrying members of the NRA. Every day, you stand up for our God-given rights without exception, without fail, and without apology. Together, we are fighting for the timeless values that have built and sustained our nation.
And our nation is greater today than it has ever been. Stronger, richer. We're doing better than ever before. We are great Americans. You're doing a great job. Thank you. Thank you. We believe in the rule of law. And we will always protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And there are some people that are running right now; I don't think they have that number one on their list.
We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we believe in the right to self-defense and the right to protect your family, your community, and your loved ones. We believe in the wisdom of our Founders. And we believe in freedom and liberty and the right to keep and bear arms.
We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. And above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government; we worship God. Every day of my administration, we are taking power out of Washington, D.C. and returning it to the American people, where it belongs.
And you see it now better than ever, with all of the resignations of all of the bad apples. They're bad apples. They tried for a coup; didn't work out so well. And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I.C. You've been watching, you've been seeing.
You've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible in our country. Corruption at the highest level -- a disgrace. Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow. And we caught them. We caught them. Who would have thought in our country? But it's called what we all together have done -- started two and a half years ago on that great November 8th. That was a great day.
Remember that day? Great day. And in a year and a half, we have one called ""November 3rd."" It's November 3rd this time. Get ready to vote. You better. You better get ready to vote. But it's all called ""draining the swamp,"" and we are doing it faster than anyone ever thought possible. Very proud of that.
And around the world, America is respected again because we are finally putting America first. Been a long time. Our economy is now the hottest anywhere on the planet Earth. Just this morning, we learned that the GDP smashed expectations, with the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter -- always the worst quarter for whatever reason.
3.2. And if we kept the same interest rates and the same quantitative easing that the previous administration had, that 3.2 would have been much higher than that. But they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years. We had a tremendous increase in inventory investment. You know what that means. And -- listen to this -- a very big increase in net exports.
Isn't it about time? Isn't that nice? We've added almost 6 million jobs since my election. And if I would have said that during the campaign, all of those people back there -- we call them the ""fake news"" -- they wouldn't have believed it. They're fake.
They're fake. Blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest rate in more than three decades. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps since our election. Wages are rising fast, and the lowest-paid workers are making the biggest percentage gains of all. And that's nice to hear.
It's about time. Unemployment recently achieved its lowest rate in 51 years, and very shortly, it should be its lowest rate in the history of our country. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American -- have reached the lowest levels of unemployment in our history. America's future has never been brighter, and yet Democrats have never been angrier, especially now that their ""collusion delusion"" has been exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud.
It's been the greatest political hoax ever in our country. Instead of working with us to rebuild our infrastructure, lower drug prices -- which, by the way, this year, for the first time in 50 years, drug prices went down. They're going to go down a lot lower. And instead of working with us to fix our trade deals -- which I'm doing without them -- and continue creating millions and millions of new jobs, which we're doing at a level that people have not seen before, that people don't even believe, Democrats are obsessed with hoaxes, delusions, and witch hunts.
It's what they're obsessed with. That's what they want to do. And we can play the game just as well or better than they do. Far-left radicals in Congress want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns. You know that. They want to take away your guns.
You better get out there and vote. You better get out there and vote. It seems like it's a long ways away. It's not. I was saying to Melania, our great First Lady, whose birthday it is today. Happy birthday, Melania! I remember standing, two and a half years ago, in the same hallway where Abraham Lincoln and so many others have stood.
My first night in the White House and I said to Melania -- I said, ""This is incredible."" And four years seemed so long away. And now here we are. We're getting ready to start up the campaign again. Start up the campaign again. I never want to do anything with MAGA because MAGA country and MAGA -- ""Make America Great Again"" has been great, but we've really made it great.
We've made it great. We've brought it back. And we're thinking about -- slogan: ""Keep America Great."" Because you have socialists and far-left Democrats that want to destroy everything that we've done. Your stock market, since the election, has hit a record high.
Almost a hundred different records I've broken. Record high. But everyone is like a genius now. They buy stock and they're all up. Everybody is benefitting and jobs are benefitting. But it can all be taken away when you start putting the wrong people in office. We've cut regulations more than any President in the history our country.
And that's in two years. In two years, we did more to regulation -- — think of that -- than any President in the history of our country. It's one of the reasons our jobs are booming; one of the reasons the economy is booming. We gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country. The biggest, ever.
And we got ANWR approved. And we got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated. Now we're going for the rest. And we had it done except for one vote. You know what I'm talking about. One vote. In recent days, leading Democrats have proposed banning new guns and confiscating existing guns from law-abiding citizens.
What they don't tell you is the bad guys aren't giving up their guns. And you're not going to be giving up your guns either. At the same time, House Democrats recently voted against notifying ICE -- these brave, great, talented, brilliant patriots -- when an illegal alien attempts to buy a gun, which is a felony.
Democrats also support sanctuary cities that release thousands of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. In fact, they like the criminal aliens and aliens so much that when we're forced to release them into our country because of the horrible immigration laws that the Democrats refuse to give us the votes -- we need some of their votes to change -- we give them as many as they can handle.
And they're not too happy about it, folks. They're not too happy. They said, ""Who came up with that idea.. In other words, Democrats want to disarm law-abiding Americans while allowing criminal aliens to operate with impunity.
But that will never happen as long as I'm your President. Not even close. I promise to defend the Second Amendment rights of every American, and I always will. I'll never let you down. Never let you down. I haven't so far, and I won't. Because as the famous saying goes, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
Very simple. The Democrats are also working hard to block the wall, but we are building the wall. They're not happy about it. And we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. We're building a lot of wall, and I want to thank Border Patrol. I want to thank our great military.
And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They've been incredible. And we are doing something that I could do very quickly, and we're doing it very quickly. But dealing with these people is very, very difficult, if you haven't noticed, okay? Any politician would've given up a long time ago. So we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year.
It's going up rapidly. Rapidly. We're also renovating tremendous stretches of wall. We have wall that's in bad shape but it's structurally sound. And rather than building new, we renovate it. We make it as good as new, save a lot of money, and we gain a lot of territory. So we have a lot of great things going.
A lot of great things going. Most importantly, Democrats must change our immigration laws right now. Right now. We can do it in -- I used to say 45 minutes. We can do it in 15 minutes. It's very simple. You know the programs; they're horrible. The asylum -- where rough, tough MS-13 gang members come in. You don't want to meet with these people, but ICE doesn't mind because ICE is throwing them out of our country by the thousands.
And the Democrats want to eliminate ICE. Can you believe that? Boy, oh, boy. But it's incredible what they've done. It's incredible what we've done. But they stand there -- asylum -- and they read a statement, ""I am afraid for my life. I am afraid to go back to my country. I want to be an American!"" And you look and you see a toughness that you don't see.
And you just see what happens with the mayor of Tijuana and others. They say, ""These people, we try and help them, and they start hitting us. They start punching us."" We don't want them in our country, and they're not getting into our country. And when they have in the past -- a lot of them have come in -- we're throwing them the hell out.
They're out. We're getting them out. But we can fix the problem so easy. And when we fix the problem -- the wall is one thing. And that will have an incredible impact. But they won't even be coming up if we change our old, broken, ridiculous, weak immigration laws. They won't even be coming up. They won't make the journey.
The wall is still good to have. We need the wall. But all of those people you see coming up -- thousands and thousands of people -- they won't be coming because they're going to say, ""There's no way we can get into the United States anymore, except by going through legal channels."" And what we want is we want people.
We need them for all of the great companies that are coming in. But people have to come into our country legally and through merit. Through merit. One of the gravest threats to the Second Amendment, and to American freedom itself, are activist judges. You see it every day. Every day. They almost always file in a certain little jurisdiction; I won't tell you what it is, but you all know.
Every time we get sued on the ban, which we ended up winning -- you know, we have the ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit; we shouldn't have. We lost in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which we shouldn't have. And we won at the United States Supreme Court. So we have the ban. Travel ban. But the reporters -- the other day, some reporter said, ""Donald Trump, who lost the travel ban…"" I didn't lose it. Well, what he meant: I lost it in the Ninth Circuit.
But he didn't say we won at the United States Supreme Court. So everybody said, ""Oh, that's too bad. He lost the…"" No, no. We won the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court. But they don't say that. So when we confronted them, they said, ""No, we were referring to the lower courts."" I said, ""What about the upper court?
They ruled. It's done."" ""Well, we weren't talking about the Supreme Court. We were saying you lost…"" These are very, very dishonest people, okay.
Nobody gets it. Why? They're opposed to strong military. They're opposed to all of the things we've done, including making our nation wealthy, including high GDPs, including all of the security and all of the law enforcement, all of the things we're doing. It's incredible. Nobody understands it. Someday, we're going to figure it out, and I'll feel much better about it. But why are they opposed to things that truly make our country great?
Why? Nobody gets it. I don't get it. The level of dishonesty and corruption in the media is unbelievable. But we're stuck with activist judges who seek to rewrite our Constitution to force their own radical views onto our country. That is why my administration has led a historic effort to confirm fair and impartial and mostly conservative judges who will interpret the Constitution as written.
And I'm very proud to announce that we will soon have 145 federal judges confirmed -- a record number -- including two great Supreme Court judges -- — Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh. Two fantastic justices. In fact, next week, we will confirm our 100th federal judge.
Nobody knows what that means. The percentage is incredible. Nobody knows what that means. And in the end, I expect to have the second-highest percentage of judges confirmed in the history of the United States -- more than any other President, except one -- I'll never beat this one -- percentage of judges approved.
You know who the one is? Take a guess. George Washington. He gets 100 percent. No, he had 100 percent. He named every one of them. But you know what? We'll have more of them. George Washington. But we're also defending free speech on our college campuses. Last month, I signed an executive order requiring public colleges and universities to respect the First Amendment rights of their students, or risk losing tens of billions of dollars in federal funding.
If you don't want to hear another voice, you don't get all of this tremendous amount -- in some cases, ridiculous amounts of dollars. And we have shut down the previous administration's massive abuse of power known as Operation Choke Point. Under this ill-advised program, government bureaucrats discouraged banks from making loans to gun retailers -- a backdoor attack on private gun ownership that will never be allowed to happen on my watch.
That's step one, folks. Step one. You know what step two, three, and four is. Step four is: You don't have guns. You don't have any way to protect yourself. Today, I'm proud to announce another historic step to protect your Second Amendment rights. And I didn't tell Chris and Wayne and Oliver; I didn't even tell them about it. So they're listening in this big room someplace, and they're saying, ""I wonder what he's going to do."" The good thing with me: You never know.
. That's why we're making trade deals that are so good for our country. So, in the last administration, President Obama signed the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. And in his waning days in office, he sent the treaty to the Senate to begin the ratification process. This treaty threatened your subjugate -- and you know exactly what's going on here -- your rights and your constitutional and international rules and restrictions and regulations.
Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone. We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom. And that is why my administration will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. I hope you're happy. I'm impressed; I didn't think too many of you would really know what it is. You what it is? A big, big factor.
But I see a couple of very happy faces from the NRA over there. We're taking our signature back. The United Nations will soon receive a formal notice that America is rejecting this treaty.
As part of this decision, I will sign right now, in front of a lot of witnesses -- a lot -- — it's a lot of witnesses -- a message asking the Senate to discontinue the treaty ratification process and to return the now-rejected treaty right back to me, in the Oval Office, where I will dispose of it. By taking these actions, we are reaffirming that American liberty is sacred and that American citizens live by American laws, not the laws of foreign countries.
Thank you. Can you believe these people.
Famous pen. As we protect gun rights for law-abiding citizens, we are also getting guns out of the hands of violent criminals. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, the murder rate had increased by more than 20 percent, and the United States had experienced the largest increase in violent crime in over 25 years.
For this reason, my administration resurrected Project Safe Neighborhoods, bringing together prosecutors, police, sheriffs, and citizens groups to put the most dangerous offenders behind bars. We funded 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of criminal offenders. And last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever in our history.
And now, violent crime is way down. Murders in America's largest cities dropped by 6 percent between 2017 and 2018. But I do have to ask you: What the hell is going on in Chicago? What is going on? We could solve that problem. We would've been down even a lot more. And it's not a tough problem to solve.
You got to let law enforcement do what they have to do. They'll solve the problem very quickly. Very quickly. We don't think enough about the victims. They're too worried about the people that cause the crime. It's got to stop. That thought process is no good. The number of police officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year, I'm so happy to report, is down 21 percent compared to the year before.
And that was the year before I took office. One of the reasons is that we are supplying police with surplus military equipment, supplies, and gears that the previous administration refused to give up. This is surplus. This is extra. We don't need it. Great equipment. Sitting in warehouses all over the country.
Billions of dollars of equipment that the military no longer needs or wants or uses, but the top of the line. Some of it has never been used -- brand new -- from vehicles to, essentially, supplies of all kind, including bulletproof vests. And rather than having it sit and draw dust, I had it distributed all over the country to our police departments.
And that's why you see these numbers. It's a great thing. You know, a lot of being President is common sense, right? Don't you think? Right? Common sense. Have a good heart, but it's common sense. In this administration, we will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. They're heroes.
They're brave. They're great. And they will tell you they haven't felt so proud of themselves for many years, because they were abandoned by Washington. They were abandoned by our politicians. And not just the Obama administration -- before that. They felt abandoned. Well, they know that I love them, and we're going to protect them just like they protect us. Incredible people.
Great people. We've also taken critical steps to improve school safety. More than 30 states now allow teachers that are highly trained -- highly trained, talented people -- to carry guns in the classroom to protect themselves and to protect their students, who they love. Who's better? Who's better?
I've been calling for that for the last two years, and I think we had a big impact. Some legislations passed, and they don't have the few paragraphs, and the legislators actually go back to governors and say, ""We're not passing it unless you allow that to happen."" So we've come a long way. But who's better to protect our students than the teachers that love them?
Through STOP School Violence grants, we are helping local schools and police departments to hire more officers, train more teachers, and address early warning signs of mental illness. Every day, citizens across America exercise their constitutional right to defend themselves, their families, and their communities.
That's a constitutional right. They want to take it away from you. They will take it away. You let these maniacs get into office, they will take that right away. I mean, you see what's going on. ""Let the Boston bomber vote. He should be voting."" Right? I don't think so. ""Let terrorists that are in prison vote."" I don't think so. Can you believe it? But this is where some of these people are coming from.
And they're the most popular ones. When Bernie Sanders made certain statements the other day, I said, ""Well, that's the end of his campaign."" Then, what happened is everybody agreed with him. We know that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Now, I wanted to be a little bit more original than to use a phrase that you probably heard a thousand times.
But what's a better phrase than that? We can't do better. How simple is that? Today, I want to give a few of these brave citizens the chance to share their stories directly with the American people. A lot of television back there. Of course, when I start going after them, you watch those red lights go off.
They don't want any part of it. They turn those lights. Then they come back. They need the ratings. In fact, at a certain point, I think they'll probably all endorse me, because would they be dead without me? Can you imagine? Can you imagine having some nice, boring person get up here?
Well, they wouldn't be up here. They would be as far away from you as possible. April Evans joins us from Virginia. One night in 2015, she was home alone with her two-year-old daughter when an intruder broke into her home violently. April took care of it. April, please come up. Please, April.
Thank you, April. She was able to defend herself. Also with us is Mark Vaughan, who owns a meat processing plant in Oklahoma. When an employee began attacking coworkers with a knife viciously and violently, Mark drew his gun and ended the assault immediately, saving countless innocent lives. Mark, please come up.
Thank you, Mark. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Finally, Stephen Willeford joins us from Sutherland Springs, Texas -- great state of Texas -- — where a mass shooter opened fire at the First Baptist Church -- you all read about it -- in November 2017, taking many innocent lives.
Wonderful, wonderful people. Stephen heroically risked his life to bring the horrible violence to an end. Stephen, please come up and say a few words.
Wow, what a job. Thank you. Thank you. Can't say it better than that. But I want to thank you all for your courage, because you're really living proof that law-abiding gun owners make a tremendous, tremendous difference. Tremendous difference. You know, Paris, France, they say, has the strongest gun laws in the world.
And you remember those maniacs, when they went into the nightclub. I use this example. There are many examples. But they shot one person, another person, another person, another person. Hundreds of people dead and horribly wounded to this day. That was five years ago. If there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side, it very well could have been a whole different result.
The shooting went on so long and there wasn't a thing you could do about it. ""Get over here."" Boom. ""Get over here."" Boom. And then they left. They were captured later. If there was only one gun. If there were two, three, four, it wouldn't have happened. Tiny percentage, by comparison. But it probably wouldn't have happened because the cowards would've known there are people in there having guns.
Wouldn't have happened. So people don't really understand the other side of the argument. I have the debate a lot, and I win the debate all the time. And the next day, you see the same person who was so badly defeated in the debate going out and saying the same thing, even though he or she, I really believe, know that you can't justify their side of the argument.
So, gun owners make our communities safer and they make our nation stronger. Americans have always understood this truth, going back to the earliest days of our nation. Two months before the American Revolution broke out, with the shot heard around the world, a group of patriots gathered along a bridge in Salem, Massachusetts.
In the preceding months, British soldiers had confiscated muskets in Boston. You know the story well. Gunpowder was seized in Somerville. And the patriots in Salem knew that the Redcoats would soon come for the town's cannons. But the Americans were prepared -- they already loved our country -- and they were determined to defend their rights to the death.
When hundreds of British soldiers arrived at the bridge, the Americans stood firm, blocking their path. When swords were drawn, they didn't flinch. When the Redcoats tried to steal American boats, the patriots sank those boats and sank them very quickly. When a British soldier held the tip of his bayonet against a man's chest, that man -- Joseph Whicher -- tore open his shirt and dared him to do his worst.
Soon, the crowd grew larger, as civilians came from miles around to stand side by side with their great countrymen against tyranny. In the face of such unbreakable resolve, the King's soldiers had no choice but to admit defeat and failure and retreat. In the courageous actions of those early Americans, we see the defiant and determined spirit of patriotism that has always willed America to its greatest victories.
It is a spirit that is passed down from generation to generation, from fathers and mothers to sons and daughters. It is the spirit that lives in each and every one of you. Our duty, our responsibility, our sacred charge, is to preserve the freedoms that our ancestors gave their very lives to secure. Because no matter how many centuries go by, no matter how much the world changes, the central drama of human history remains the same.
On one side are those who seek power, control, and domination. And on the other side are patriots like those in this hall who stand upright and plant their feet in eternal defense of our liberty. And with God as our witness, we swear today that we will defend our rights, we will safeguard our freedoms, we will uphold our heritage, we will protect our Constitution, and we will make America stronger, prouder, safer, and greater than ever, ever, ever before! To all of our incredible friends at the NRA: Thank you for fighting the good fight.
It is an honor to fight by your side, and it's an honor to be with everyone in this giant hall today. I am with you. I will never, ever let you down. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2011-07-25,"All of the pressure on the debt ceiling is on Obama. It's not on the Republicans, even though they think it is, nobody's gonna remember Boehner or anybody else, they're only gonna remember Obama unless the Republicans can make a phenomenal deal, including getting rid of Obamacare, they should just tap it along because if this is going On prior to the election, there's no way that Obama can be reelected and that would be a great thing for the country. So don't fold.
Republicans don't give up the pressures on him. I know you think it's on you. The pressure is on Obama and the Democrats.
Do not fold, do not give up, you can tap it along, you can make it go longer, that's okay as long as it comes up before the election, if you make the great deal that's wonderful for the country, although it probably means Obama will get reelected. But if you make the great deal, the really good one that takes precedence over everything. But if you don't get that deal, which I don't think you will and I don't think you can let these discussions begin again in a year from now, which is before the presidential election and you can guarantee Obama cannot get reelected.
It's impossible for him to get reelected if this isn't solved. So don't be stupid. Don't be foolish either make the unbelievable great deal.
In fact, great to me, the only great deal is in addition to everything else you have to get rid of Obamacare. So either make the unbelievably good deal or have this whole discussion start around June or July of next year and I guarantee you one thing, Obama will not be President for long.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-09-07,"Hi Brady. How are you?
Nice to see you. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Great honor.
Good.
Yeah.
Well, the farmers are going to be in very good shape as soon as I finish the various deals. The farmers have been shut out from the EU, which is basically Europe.  They've been shut out from Canada, as you know, Canada is charging tremendous tariffs, almost 300 percent on dairy products. They've been shut out, to a large extent, in China while they do business with China, they're still shut out.
And what we're doing is, we're knocking down those trade barriers, and the farmers are going to be the biggest beneficiary.
And remember this: before my election, if you look at soybeans, five years before my election they dropped 5 -- or down -- each year, they were dropping down 10 and 15 percent. They ended up dropping 50 percent, and that's just for a period of five years and that's before we ever got here. So whether it's soybeans, or corn or any of it, I think the farmers are going to have a much bigger market.
But I have to get the trade deals done. I have to say this -- these countries have been really ripping the United States for a long time. They are very spoiled, but now they're learning. Those barriers are coming down and they're coming along. We've made our deal with Mexico. Canada is negotiating with us right now, and we have a lot of cards, as you know.
And I think the farmers have been terrific, because they say, look, President Trump knows what he's doing. It was time that somebody did it. We're going to open up the markets
Well, you have to remember they've been worried for 15 years. For 15 years they haven't been doing well and for 15 years, they've really been hurt by the trade practices of other countries. And I will tell you that I think the farming business is going to be very good as soon as I finish up with the things we're working on right now. And if you push it too fast, you're not going to make the right deal.
So, I don't want to push it too fast. The farmers are great patriots. They know exactly what I'm doing, and they've been behind me 100 percent. And I said this even during the -- as you remember -- during the primary campaigns, and during the campaign I said we're going to take care of the farmers we have to make new trade deals. The trade deals that we have in this country NAFTA and others are absolutely terrible.
So they're being renegotiated to the benefit of our country.
Well, they would have lost them anyway because they were being hurt so badly with the trade barriers. We will tell you they are going to be in a very good position very soon.
Well, what we're going to do -- and you have that problem, and so do a lot of -- because we're at 3.9% even 3.8% percent unemployment, which is great in most respects, but for businesses, a lot of people are going to be coming in through a merit system of immigration, which we're working on. And I think I'm going to be able to have it done very quickly.
But we want people to come into the country through merit, not through lotteries and not through other ways. We're going to have a lot of farmers, a lot of help for our farmers. And I think that's going to take place very soon. But I want people coming into the country through the merit system, not through a system where we have no idea who we're taking.
I'm talking about securing the borders, and we have largely. I mean, the borders are doing much better now, even though we have horrible laws. We have horrible, horrible laws. But the borders are doing much better now. But we want people to come in -- I want people to come into the country, but I want them to come in through merit.
Absolutely.
Well, I'm working on the bill with the Senate and that's going to be an important bill. We're also working through the postal system, because you know what's going on with fentanyl it's and you know where it's coming from, mostly coming from China, and we're working on a very strong stop act within the postal system. In addition to that, I had $6 billion approved to fight -- and to help -- with the opioid problem.
And we got that in the last budget. So we're doing a really big job. Most areas tend to be down, you know, with doctors and with other prescription type of things. So most areas -- I'm a little surprised that you're up -- but most areas tend to be down. We're fighting it very hard. We have $6 billion now, just got approved. We've got $6 billion now to fight the opioid crisis.
Yes. It's all been approved. It's all been approved. It's starting to flow in.
I think she's a terrific leader. She's been a terrific Congresswoman. She's done a great job. She's been very supportive of me. She's a tremendous leader. And I can tell you, she loves your state. She really loves your state. South Dakota is very important to her. And she left a very big job. You know, she is highly respected had good positions in Congress, she left that to become governor.
I think she'll be a great governor of your state. And she has some of the things you're talking about. She's very much talking about them, including ethanol which we discussed at great length at a meeting just now.
No, actually she's very much of a rebel within Congress. I mean she was somebody that would oftentimes go against Congress. And, I think that's why she probably did so well in terms of her primary election. She -- she's very much of -- and I use the term very affectionately in a sense -- she was very much of a rebel. She wanted things to change in Congress, and she helped.
She was terrific. She was a highly respected Congresswoman. And a lot of people are going to miss her.
Well, I think we've done a great job. On the economy we've done great. Our military is now being rebuilt. It was in shambles after eight years of President Obama. The military was absolutely in shambles. A lot of bad decisions were made, and they weren't renewing -- and we have done a tremendous job with the military, including the vets where we have choice, where we have so many other things that we've got approved that he was unable to get approved.
But, now we have Veterans Choice. We have veterans accountability. I think that we are probably less divided than we were when he was president. If you look at the divisions now, a lot of them are artificial. A lot of them are put up by people running for president in two years. And I think we probably are a lot -- lot less divided. But I can tell you this: our country is doing much better.
I mean if you look at the economy you look at all of the numbers 4.2%. You look at the GDP numbers which I think are going to go substantially higher. We have tremendous potential in this country, and I think he sees what we're doing, and I think he's probably saying, wow I wish I could have done that.
Sure I always would say that. But if you look at President Obama, look at what took place during his presidency, it was -- it was actually terrible. So, I think we've come a long way. Thank you very much.
Take care of yourself.
Thank you. Thank you.

Edward Timpson,United Kingdom,2018-02-25,"Thanks for that kind introduction Mark. It’s a pleasure to be here.
This morning I want to concentrate on some of the big challenges facing parents, politicians and industry leaders in making sure advertising and media doesn’t catalyse children into adults too quickly.
Some of these challenges are still very new to us. We don’t know what impact they’ll have on children in the years ahead. Others are far more familiar. These are the age-old issues that parents have been fretting over for decades and continue to fret over today.
So on the one hand we have the march of weird and wonderful – sometimes frankly bizarre – technologies that are transforming the way our children access information and socialise. I read an article in The Telegraph the other day about a puffer jacket that automatically expands to give you a hug when someone likes your Facebook status. I’ve resisted the temptation to buy one…
On the other hand, we have what might be classified as the ‘bad penny’ challenges. The ones that keep on turning up over the years. Issues over the messages young people are exposed to in the home or in the street. Swearing, violence, sex or inappropriate imagery.
Neither challenge – whether originating in the 21st century or 20th – is remotely simple to deal with.
So I’d like to offer my real appreciation to the Advertising Association, and its members, for their thoughtful, positive engagement with Government on the Bailey Review over the last year.
It is very difficult for those not directly involved – and I have to include myself here – to appreciate fully the very fine judgements involved in regulating advertising and media.
Arbitrating over matters of public taste and decency is not remotely straightforward: particularly when opinion varies so subtly between the regions, sexes and generations – even between parents. One person’s supreme indifference can easily be another’s grave concern.
In this context, I must applaud the industry as a whole – including major brands and retailers – for their intelligent approach over the last year in tackling the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood.
Thanks to your leadership, we are now making steady progress against most of Reg Bailey’s major recommendations. Better than that, we are making swift progress.
In the space of a few short months, you have made it simpler for parents to navigate media regulation with the launch of Parent Port. Only a year after its launch, a good proportion of parents already know about it. A great achievement.
On top of this, the ASA has issued new guidelines on outdoor ads: aimed at reducing children’s exposure to provocative on-street advertising.
Internet Service Providers are making it easier for parents to police the material their children see online.
The Advertising Association has been working with Media Smart to develop the excellent new Digital Adwise Parent Pack – which is being previewed today ahead of its public launch later this month – to give parents invaluable guidance on digital advertising.
And the industry is meeting parents’ expectations better when it comes to pre-watershed TV, with new guidelines issued for TV and radio.
These achievements deserve considerable fanfare and fireworks. So my thanks again for your positive engagement with government – and my congratulations.
Over the last year, we have seen that advertising in the UK has some of the most rigorous protections for children in the world. It is exceptionally well regulated. It is responsive. It is effective. It is regarded globally as the gold-standard for all others to follow.
From a personal perspective, I have no desire at all to rock this particular boat. I am firmly of the belief that heavy handed and unnecessary government regulation of the ad industry is to be avoided.
But looking ahead, it’s vitally important that advertisers and the wider business community continue to contribute towards, and lead, this debate. I’m very keen on the ‘work together’ approach espoused by today’s conference.
So it is encouraging to see so many major brands here, alongside advertising agencies and the media. And to see them put pen to paper on improved ways of working.
The industry’s pledge, led by the Advertising Association, on reducing commercial pressures on children – restricting the recruitment of under-16s as brand ambassadors or peer-to-peer marketers – is a case in point: embraced by global brands like Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Unilever.
On top of this, it is refreshing to see so many of the UK’s leading high street chains drawing up their code of good practice – through the British Retail Consortium – on appropriate retailing to children, including the design, materials and display of children’s clothes.

Grover Cleveland,United States of America,1897-03-02 00:00:00,"To the House of Representatives:
I herewith return without approval House bill No. 7864, entitled ""An act to amend the immigration laws of the United States.""
By the first section of this bill it is proposed to amend section 1 of the act of March 3, 1891, relating to immigration by adding to the classes of aliens thereby excluded from admission to the United States the following:
All persons physically capable and over 16 years of age who can not read and write the English language or some other language; but a person not so able to read and write who is over 50 years of age and is the parent or grandparent of a qualified immigrant over 21 years of age and capable of supporting such parent or grandparent may accompany such immigrant, or such a parent or grandparent may be sent for and come to join the family of a child or grandchild over 21 years of age similarly qualified and capable, and a wife or minor child not so able to read and write may accompany or be sent for and come and join the husband or parent similarly qualified and capable.
A radical departure from our national policy relating to immigration is here presented. Heretofore we have welcomed all who came to us from other lands except those whose moral or physical condition or history threatened danger to our national welfare and safety. Relying upon the zealous watchfulness of our people to prevent injury to our political and social fabric, we have encouraged those coming from foreign countries to cast their lot with us and join in the development of our vast domain, securing in return a share in the blessings of American citizenship.
A century's stupendous growth, largely due to the assimilation and thrift of millions of sturdy and patriotic adopted citizens, attests the success of this generous and free-handed policy which, while guarding the people's interests, exacts from our immigrants only physical and moral soundness and a willingness and ability to work.
A contemplation of the grand results of this policy can not fail to arouse a sentiment in its defense, for however it might have been regarded as an original proposition and viewed as an experiment its accomplishments are such that if it is to be uprooted at this late day its disadvantages should be plainly apparent and the substitute adopted should be just and adequate, free from uncertainties, and guarded against difficult or oppressive administration.
It is not claimed, I believe, that the time has come for the further restriction of immigration on the ground that an excess of population overcrowds our land.
It is said, however, that the quality of recent immigration is undesirable. The time is quite within recent memory when the same thing was said of immigrants who, with their descendants, are now numbered among our best citizens.
It is said that too many immigrants settle in our cities, thus dangerously increasing their idle and vicious population. This is certainly a disadvantage. It can not be shown, however, that it affects all our cities, nor that it is permanent; nor does it appear that this condition where it exists demands as its remedy the reversal of our present immigration policy.
The claim is also made that the influx of foreign laborers deprives of the opportunity to work those who are better entitled than they to the privilege of earning their livelihood by daily toil. An unfortunate condition is certainly presented when any who are willing to labor are unemployed, but so far as this condition now exists among our people it must be conceded to be a result of phenomenal business depression and the stagnation of all enterprises in which labor is a factor. With the advent of settled and wholesome financial and economic governmental policies and consequent encouragement to the activity of capital the misfortunes of unemployed labor should, to a great extent at least, be remedied. If it continues, its natural consequences must be to check the further immigration to our cities of foreign laborers and to deplete the ranks of those already there. In the meantime those most willing and best entitled ought to be able to secure the advantages of such work as there is to do.
It is proposed by the bill under consideration to meet the alleged difficulties of the situation by establishing an educational test by which the right of a foreigner to make his home with us shall be determined. Its general scheme is to prohibit from admission to our country all immigrants ""physically capable and over 16 years of age who can not read and write the English language or some other language,"" and it is provided that this test shall be applied by requiring immigrants seeking admission to read and afterwards to write not less than twenty nor more than twenty-five words of the Constitution of the United States in some language, and that any immigrant failing in this shall not be admitted, but shall be returned to the country from whence he came at the expense of the steamship or railroad company which brought him.
The best reason that could be given for this radical restriction of immigration is the necessity of protecting our population against degeneration and saving our national peace and quiet from imported turbulence and disorder.
I can not believe that we would be protected against these evils by limiting immigration to those who can read and write in any language twenty-five words of our Constitution. In my opinion, it is infinitely more safe to admit a hundred thousand immigrants who, though unable to read and write, seek among us only a home and opportunity to work than to admit one of those unruly agitators and enemies of governmental control who can not only read and write, but delights in arousing by inflammatory speech the illiterate and peacefully inclined to discontent and tumult. Violence and disorder do not originate with illiterate laborers. They are, rather, the victims of the educated agitator. The ability to read and write, as required in this bill, in and of itself affords, in my opinion, a misleading test of contented industry and supplies unsatisfactory evidence of desirable citizenship or a proper apprehension of the benefits of our institutions. If any particular element of our illiterate immigration is to be feared for other causes than illiteracy, these causes should be dealt with directly, instead of making illiteracy the pretext for exclusion, to the detriment of other illiterate immigrants against whom the real cause of complaint can not be alleged.
The provisions intended to rid that part of the proposed legislation already referred to from obvious hardship appears to me to be indefinite and inadequate.
A parent, grandparent, wife, or minor child of a qualified immigrant, though unable to read and write, may accompany the immigrant or be sent for to join his family, provided the immigrant is capable of supporting such relative. These exceptions to the general rule of exclusion contained in the bill were made to prevent the separation of families, and yet neither brothers nor sisters are provided for. In order that relatives who are provided for may be reunited, those still in foreign lands must be sent for to join the immigrant here. What formality is necessary to constitute this prerequisite, and how are the facts of relationship and that the relative is sent for to be established? Are the illiterate relatives of immigrants who have come here under prior laws entitled to the advantage of these exceptions? A husband who can read and write and who determines to abandon his illiterate wife abroad will find here under this law an absolutely safe retreat. The illiterate relatives mentioned must not only be sent for, but such immigrant must be capable of supporting them when they arrive. This requirement proceeds upon the assumption that the foreign relatives coming here are in every case, by reason of poverty, liable to become a public charge unless the immigrant is capable of their support. The contrary is very often true. And yet if unable to read and write, though quite able and willing to support themselves and their relatives here besides, they could not be admitted under the provisions of this bill if the immigrant was impoverished, though the aid of his fortunate but illiterate relative might be the means of saving him from pauperism.
The fourth section of this bill provides--
That it shall be unlawful for any male alien who has not in good faith made his declaration before the proper court of his intention to become a citizen of the United States to be employed on any public works of the United States or to come regularly or habitually into the United States by land or water for the purpose of engaging in any mechanical trade or manual labor for wages or salary, returning from time to time to a foreign country.
The fifth section provides--
That it shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, company, or corporation knowingly to employ any alien coming into the United States in violation of the next preceding section of this act.
The prohibition against the employment of aliens upon any public works of the United States is in line with other legislation of a like character. It is quite a different thing, however, to declare it a crime for an alien to come regularly and habitually into the United States for the purpose of obtaining work from private parties, if such alien returns from time to time to a foreign country, and to constitute any employment of such alien a criminal offense.
When we consider these provisions of the bill in connection with our long northern frontier and the boundaries of our States and Territories, often but an imaginary line separating them from the British dominions, and recall the friendly intercourse between the people who are neighbors on either side, the provisions of this bill affecting them must be regarded as illiberal, narrow, and un-American.
The residents of these States and Territories have separate and especial interests which in many cases make an interchange of labor between their people and their alien neighbors most important, frequently with the advantage largely in favor of our citizens. This suggests the inexpediency of Federal interference with these conditions when not necessary to the correction of a substantial evil, affecting the general welfare. Such unfriendly legislation as is proposed could hardly fail to provoke retaliatory measures, to the injury of many of our citizens who now find employment on adjoining foreign soil.
The uncertainty of construction to which the language of these provisions is subject is a serious objection to a statute which describes a crime. An important element in the offense sought to be created by these sections is the coming ""regularly or habitually into the United States."" These words are impossible of definite and certain construction. The same may be said of the equally important words ""returning from time to time to a foreign country.""
A careful examination of this bill has convinced me that for the reasons given and others not specifically stated its provisions are unnecessarily harsh and oppressive, and that its defects in construction would cause vexation and its operation would result in harm to our citizens.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-05-23,"Thank you very much. It's very nice. And thank you to Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I also want to thank Sara for hosting us last night in really a very unforgettable dinner. We had a great time. We talked about a lot of very, very important things. And thank you to Ambassador David Friedman and Mrs. Friedman for joining us, along with a number of very good friends who have come from our country to yours, as we reaffirm the unshakable bond between the United States of America and Israel. Thank you.
I'd like to begin my remarks today by sending the thoughts and prayers of the entire American people to the victims of the terrorist attack in Manchester. You know -- you've all been watching. You've seen just a horrible thing going on. I want to send our condolences to the many families who lost their loved ones. Horrific, horrific injuries. Terrible. Dozens of innocent people, beautiful young children savagely murdered in this heinous attack upon humanity. I repeat again that we must drive out the terrorists and the extremists from our midst, obliterate this evil ideology, and protect and defend our citizens and people of the world.
All civilized nations much be united in this effort. This trip is focused on that goal: bringing nations together around the goal of defeating the terrorism that threatens the world, and crushing the hateful ideology that drives it so hard and seems to be driving it so fast. It is a privilege to stand here in this national museum, in the ancient city of Jerusalem, to address the Israeli people and all people in the Middle East who yearn for security, prosperity and peace.
Jerusalem is a sacred city. Its beauty, splendor, and heritage are like no other place on Earth. What a heritage. The ties of the Jewish people to this Holy Land are ancient and eternal.
Yesterday, I visited the Western Wall, and marveled at the monument to Gods presence and mans perseverance. I was humbled to place my hand upon the wall and to pray in that holy space for wisdom from God. I also visited and prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a site revered by Christians throughout the world. I laid a wreath at Yad Vashem, honoring, remembering, and mourning the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. I pledged right then and there what I pledge again today: the words ""never again.
Israel is a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people. From all parts of this great country, one message resounds, and that is the message of hope. Down through the ages, the Jewish people have suffered persecution, oppression, and even those who have sought their destruction. But, through it all, they have endured and, in fact, they have thrived. I stand in awe of the accomplishments of the Jewish people, and I make this promise to you: My administration will always stand with Israel.
Through your hardships, you have created one of the most abundant lands anywhere in the world -- a land that is rich not only in history, culture, and opportunity, but especially in spirit. This museum where we are gathered today tells the story of that spirit. From the two Holy Temples, to the glorious heights of Masada, we see an incredible story of faith and perseverance. That faith is what inspired Jews to believe in their destiny, to overcome their despair, and to build here -- right here -- a future that others dared not even to dream.
In Israel, not only are Jews free to till the soil, teach their children, and pray to God in the ancient land of their fathers -- and they love this land, and they love God -- but Muslims, Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience, and to follow their dreams, right here. Today, gathered with friends, I call upon all people -- Jews, Christians, Muslims, and every faith, every tribe, every creed -- to draw inspiration from this ancient city, to set aside our sectarian differences, to overcome oppression and hatred, and to give all children the freedom and hope and dignity written into our souls.
Earlier this week, I spoke at a very historic summit in Saudi Arabia. I was hosted by King Salman -- a very wise man. There, I urged our friends in the Muslim world to join us in creating stability, safety and security. And I was deeply encouraged by the desire of many leaders to join us in cooperation toward these shared and vital goals.
Conflict cannot continue forever. The only question is when nations will decide that they have had enough -- enough bloodshed, enough killing. That historic summit represents a new opportunity for people throughout the Middle East to overcome sectarian and religious divisions, to extinguish the fires of extremism, and to find common ground and shared responsibility in making the future of this region so much better than it is right now.
Change must come from within. It can only come from within. No mother or father wants their children to grow up in a world where terrorists roam free, schoolchildren are murdered, and their loved ones are taken. No child is born with prejudice in their heart. No one should teach young boys and girls to hate and to kill. No civilized nation can tolerate the massacre of innocents with chemical weapons.
My message to that summit was the same message I have for you: We must build a coalition of partners who share the aim of stamping out extremists and violence, and providing our children a peaceful and hopeful future. But a hopeful future for children in the Middle East requires the world to fully recognize the vital role of the State of Israel.
Israelis have experienced firsthand the hatred and terror of radical violence. Israelis are murdered by terrorists wielding knives and bombs. Hamas and Hezbollah launch rockets into Israeli communities where schoolchildren have to be trained to hear the sirens and run to the bomb shelters -- with fear, but with speed. ISIS targets Jewish neighborhoods, synagogues, and storefronts. And Irans leaders routinely call for Israels destruction. Not with Donald J. Trump, believe me. I like you too.
Despite these challenges, Israel is thriving as a sovereign nation, and no international body should question the contributions Israel makes to the region and, indeed, the world. Today, let us pray for that peace and for a more hopeful future across the Middle East.
There are those who present a false choice. They say that we must choose between supporting Israel and supporting Arab and Muslim nations in the region. That is completely wrong. All decent people want to live in peace, and all humanity is threatened by the evils of terrorism. Diverse nations can unite around the goal of protecting innocent life, upholding human dignity, and promoting peace and stability in the region.
My administration is committed to pursuing such a coalition, and we have already made substantial progress during this trip. We know, for instance, that both Israelis and Palestinians seek lives of hope for their children. And we know that peace is possible if we put aside the pain and disagreements of the past and commit together to finally resolving this crisis, which has dragged on for nearly half a century or more.
As I have repeatedly said, I am personally committed to helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a peace agreement, and I had a meeting this morning with President Abbas and can tell you that the Palestinians are ready to reach for peace. I know youve heard it before. I am telling you -- thats what I do. They are ready to reach for peace.
In my meeting with my very good friend, Benjamin, I can tell you also that he is reaching for peace. He wants peace. He loves people. He especially loves the Israeli people. Benjamin Netanyahu wants peace.
Making peace, however, will not be easy. We all know that. Both sides will face tough decisions. But with determination, compromise, and the belief that peace is possible, Israelis and Palestinians can make a deal.
But even as we work toward peace, we will build strength to defend our nations. The United States is firmly committed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and halting their support of terrorists and militias.
Americas security partnership with Israel is stronger than ever. It is my hope that someday, very soon, Israeli children will never need to rush towards shelters again as sirens ring out loud and clear.
Finally, the United States is proud that Israeli Air Force pilots are flying the incredible, new American F-35 planes.
But even as we strengthen our partnership in practice, let us always remember our highest ideals. Let us never forget that the bond between our two nations is woven together in the hearts of our people, and their love of freedom, hope, and dignity for every man and every woman. Let us dream of a future where Jewish, Muslim, and Christian children can grow up together and live together in trust, harmony, tolerance, and respect.
The values that are practiced in Israel have inspired millions and millions of people all across the world. The conviction of Theodor Herzl rings true today: Whatever we attempt there for our own benefit will rebound mightily and beneficially to the good of all mankind.
As we stand in Jerusalem, we see pilgrims of all faiths coming to this land to walk on this hallowed ground. Jews place the prayers from their hearts in the stone blocks of the beautiful Western Wall. Christians pray in the pews of an ancient church. Muslims answer the call to prayer at their holy sites. This city, like no other place in the world, reveals the longing of human hearts to know and to worship God.
Jerusalem stands as a reminder that life can flourish against any odds. When we look around this city -- so beautiful -- and we see people of all faiths engaged in reverent worship, and schoolchildren learning side-by-side, and men and women lifting up the needy and forgotten, we see that Gods promise of healing has brought goodness to so many lives. We see that the people of this land had the courage to overcome the oppression and injustice of the past and to live in the freedom God intends for every person on this Earth.
Today, in Jerusalem, we pray and we hope that children around the world will be able to live without fear, to dream without limits, and to prosper without violence. I ask this land of promise to join me to fight our common enemies, to pursue our shared values, and to protect the dignity of every child of God. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the State of Israel. And God bless the United States. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Delivers Remarks at the Israel Museum,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-israel-musem-may-23-2017
Lord Adonis,United Kingdom,2015-02-20,"I took a journey for a week in the spring travelling the railways of Britain. It’s taken me two thousand miles to get here. I met some wonderful people, including the transport staff who keep Britain moving day by day. I enjoyed it so much, I’ve still got the bug. Faced yesterday with a train from London to Brighton I had this irresistible urge to go via Inverness.
More exciting journeys lie ahead of us in all fields of transport and I want to talk to you about them today.
Good transport changes lives. It strengthens communities. It spreads prosperity around the whole country. It’s what we in Labour are all about. But we face a challenge: how to reconcile personal mobility for all, one of the foundations of social justice, with tackling climate change in our generation. I believe we can meet this challenge. We do not have to choose between being green and being free. But only if we create a green transport system for the future.
What does green transport mean?
It means a plan for fundamental change, not incremental change, in the way we travel. No lazy cop-out that society and government should be neutral between different forms of transport, but going for green as a matter of principle.
Take cycling, the greenest form of travel. For too long in this country we have hesitated to promote cycling as a mainstream form of transport.
Yet consider. More than half of all journeys – including journeys to work, to school and to college – are of five miles or less. If we made it easier and safer, more people would cycle. Just talk to the people already on their bikes. They love it. They sail past the traffic, they enjoy the exercise, they get a sense of freedom.
And the cost in petrol?
Nothing.
In much of continental Europe, cycling is already mainstream. In Copenhagen, where I was discussing green transport last week, a staggering 40 per cent of journeys are now by bike.
It is the same in towns and cities across Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and Holland. The railway station I recently visited in the small Dutch city of Leiden has supervised parking for 6,000 bikes – 6,000, four times the number in all London’s rail terminals combined. No surprise – a third of all Dutch rail passengers use bikes to get to and from their final destination. In Britain the figure is not a third, but three per cent.
Now, our continental neighbours don’t cycle more because somehow it’s in their genes, but because it’s safe and supported. It needs to be here too. Our rail stations, our workplaces, our schools, colleges and universities, our streets, all need to be cycle friendly.
That’s why, as a step forward, I am today announcing a £14 million programme to create cycling hubs in ten of our major stations including Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and London St Pancras, Victoria and Waterloo. These stations will have thousands of extra supervised bike parking places, as well as cheap cycle repairs and safe cycle routes to and from the stations.
If we want a cycling revolution in this country, everyone should be able to join in. For us, “on your bike” is a transport option, not an insult to the unemployed. These new cycling hubs should be a model not only for other stations, but also for major employers nationwide – starting with government itself.
Joining up different ways of travelling is fundamental to green transport. Not just bikes and trains but better bus interchanges, more car parking at stations, more parkway stations, encouraging people to leave the car at home or to use it for only part of their journey.
Thanks to Labour, millions of older and disabled people are now benefiting from free bus travel. And we should shout this from the rooftops at the General Election. To encourage more bus use we are promoting smartcard ticketing, so that – as with Oystercard in London – passengers can get on and off buses, and change between buses and trains, quickly and easily.
Green transport also means a plan for going green within each mode of transport.
For rail it means more electrification. Gordon Brown and I have set out the biggest electrification programme in a generation – Liverpool to Manchester; London to Bristol, Oxford, Cardiff and Swansea. Wales will no longer be the only European nation besides Albania without a single mile of electrified railway.
For cars, vans and buses, going green means tough carbon limits on new vehicles, and big incentives for the manufacture and take-up of electric and hybrid models to get them off the drawing board and onto the drive.
Aviation must also go much greener. Ed Miliband and I have set a target – the first of its kind in the world – for UK aviation emissions to be lower in 2050 than they are today. Let me stress: all airport expansion, including Heathrow, must be compatible with this target. Greater fuel efficiency and new technologies will help us get there. So too will the international cap on aviation emissions which we are negotiating hard for in the run-up to Copenhagen.
The next essential for green transport is sustained investment in public transport.
Yes, of course these are tough economic times.
But – under this Labour government there will be no repeat of the stop-go, start then cancel, approach to transport which the Tories adopted in past recessions.
Take Crossrail. Proposed in the 1970s, planned in the 1980s, cancelled in the 1990s by the Tories.
I was very grateful for that health advice, so much so I wanted to approach Mr O’Leary with other medical issues of mine, but alas his charges for additional baggage were just too high, so I’m sticking with the NHS.
But let me say something about sanity and insanity in transport policy.
Insanity would be planning yet more motorways and short-haul flights between our major cities where high-speed rail can meet demand.
Sanity is to plan for the 21st century with 21st century technology – fast, clean and green. High speed rail wins on all counts. For large passenger flows between major cities, it is far more energy efficient than cars and planes. It gives huge extra capacity. It slashes journey times and it takes people to the centre of cities connecting directly into other public transport. That’s why I think that for Britain, high speed rail is a no brainer.
Most of Europe and Asia thinks so too. In Europe alone there are now 3,600 miles of high speed rail, plus an extra 7,300 miles in construction or planning.
The trouble is that only 68 of those miles are in Britain, and even those 68 don’t connect any of our major cities, much as I love Folkestone.
By contrast Paris-Marseille, Frankfurt-Hannover, Madrid-Barcelona, Rome-Milan – all are now linked by 200 mile an hour high speed trains – yes, displacing thousands of short-haul flights in the process. But London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh – all are still dependent on slow, saturated, Victorian railways.
Two thirds of journeys from Scotland to London are therefore by plane.
A north-south high speed rail line is a twenty year project, with big planning and financial implications.
But I’ve always been an optimist not a fatalist, and Labour’s whole approach to this great project will be one of ‘can do’ not ‘can’t do’. I see this as the union railway, uniting England and Scotland, north and south, richer and poorer parts of our country, sharing wealth and opportunity, pioneering a fundamentally better Britain.
This high speed vision is possible if we make green transport our common cause. True to Labour values. True to our vision of a United Kingdom and a united, prosperous and fair society. The choice is clear. Join Labour on this great journey. Let’s not go down the Tory dead-end street.
",2009 Speech to Labour Party Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/lord-adonis-2009-speech-to-labour-party-conference/
Margaret Thatcher,United Kingdom,2020-03-28,"The Prime Minister has made a very long statement and it would neither be possible nor desirable for me to comment on each and every point, especially as much of it will be the subject of debate later in the week. I shall confine myself, therefore, to my usual few points.
​ First, is the Prime Minister aware that we welcome any strong action by Governments which will bring terrorists to justice and which will prevent further violent acts of the kind which we are seeing far too often in Europe, that we welcome the setting of the date for the direct elections, and that we welcome the declaration of democracy which makes it clear that there is no room in Europe for any one-party State?
Secondly, as there appears to have been a great deal of discussion on international currency and exchange rates and a good deal of confusion—indeed, contradiction—in the reports, it would be helpful if the Prime Minister could clear up some of that confusion and, in particular, if he could say whether there is any change in the Government’s policy of allowing exchange rates to float either against all currencies or specifically against those of our Community partners.
Thirdly, will the Prime Minister say whether there has been any change in the very firm view taken at the Downing Street Summit—I am aware that it was of a different composition—against trade protection? He will remember that at the Downing Street Summit there was a communiqué which said that protection would foster unemployment, increase inflation and undermine the welfare of our peoples. Is that still his view about a country which exports as much as we do?
",1978 Speech on the European Council in Copenhagen,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/margaret-thatcher-1978-speech-on-the-european-council-in-copenhagen/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-11-02,"Wow, thank you so much. Hello, West Virginia. What a place. You know, we only won West Virginia by 42 points last time. 42 points. You know what that is? That's like -- did anyone ever hear of 42 points -- and we're going to better this time, OK? But I'm thrilled to be back in this great state. I love this state with thousands of hard working American patriots.
And what job numbers we had today. Did you hear? Did you hear? We're going to that. They all say speak about the economy. Speak about the economy. Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country... but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right? Because we have a lot of other things to talk about.
Also, very important, the economy I unbelievable. You know it better than anybody because your state under our great Governor Big Jim Justice wherever he may be. Where is he? Where's big Jim? He's around here someplace. One thing you can't miss him. There he is. You can't miss him. He's got to be 6'11 and he's up there in the weight, but I won't get into it. He's the greatest.
But I'm going to introduce him in a second. But we're here to celebrate our amazing achievements together, to make America's incredible comeback continuing and we will. Right now we're moving full speed ahead like nobody thought was possible. They did not think it was possible. They did not think it. In just four days -- so important.
Because you have a great candidate. You have a couple of great candidates. Carol is a great candidate also. You know that. Carol Miller. In just four days the people of West Virginia are going to send Carol Miller to the House and Patrick Morrisey to the Senate so we making America great again. This election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've unleashed.
Nobody can believe what's happened. Or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future. America now has the best economy in the history of our country, and we want to keep it that way. In last month alone we added -- this just came out a few hours ago -- 250,000 jobs.
That's in the month of October, by the way. That's for one month. And nearly half a million Americans returned to the workforce. We've created 4.5 million new jobs since the election, a number that was unthinkable. If I would have said that during the campaign, oh they would have given me a hard time. They would have said Pinocchio, you know, they do the whole thing.
Oh boy. And we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years. More Americans are working today -- think of this -- than ever before. More American today, right now, this hour, are working than ever before in the history of our country.
How good is that? How do you lose that debate? When we're debating a lefty, how do you lose the debate when they're looking at you and say well, we're going to look at jobs. But more Americans in the history of our country. I mean that to me is -- here's another one. African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans unemployment have all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country.
How do you lose that in a debate? How do you lose that in a debate? It's always nice. You know, when you go into a debate it is nice to have the facts on your side. It's going to be very tough to beat. Wages are rising and you know it's -- it's been incredible. And it just got announced they're going at the fastest pace in much more than a decade and wages went up. First time in a long time.
They haven't gone up. People were making more money 19 years ago. I used to talk about it during the campaign. Where people had single jobs and they were making more money than they had with two and three jobs today. And now for the first time wages are going up, and they're going up nicely, and people have a choice of lots of different jobs.
And right here in West Virginia jobless claims reached the lowest level in the history of your state. Is that good? No wonder I won by 42 points. No wonder. But then it was just talk. Remember? When I came, I was campaigning. What did you know? I mean, it was another, ""Can you believe politicians?"" I'm a politician.
I guess. I have to say. Am I a politician? But I said things. And we overperformed, let's put it that way. We overperformed. And West Virginia's very happy, and that coal is coming back and our miners are working again, folks. They're working again. After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.
And as you know very well, because you look at your wallet, Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal and we're putting our coal miners back to work. That you know better than anybody.
Remember when my opponent in the last race went to another state about four weeks before she got to West Virginia? And she was bragging, how she was going to put the coal miners out of work? Remember that? Remember that? And I said, ""You know? I don't think this is going to play well in four weeks."" She was in a non-coal state, talking about how she was going to put the coal business out of business.
That didn't work. It's doing great. And countries are buying our coal, and Asia now, you see what's happening? Asia's buying massive amounts. And you're back in business, folks. You're back in business. You wouldn't have been in business for another 12 months. You were going to be out of business in 12 months.
You couldn't have -- you couldn't have sustained it. I'm telling you, the timing was perfect. Don't ever wait that long. You were ready. You were ready to go over the cliff. That wasn't good. But you're back in business. Your miners are back. And last year, our coal export skyrocketed by 65 percent. Pretty amazing.
Under Republican leadership, America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning. Winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first. It's been a long time. But if Chuck Schumer -- cryin' Chuck -- and Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... take power, they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress.
That's what's going to happen. They're going to work hard, and we will be fighting. Oh, it will be -- it will be ridiculous, frankly. It'll be bad for our country. The Democrats -- and it could happen. Could happen. We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate. But it could happen. And you know what you do? My whole life.
You know what I say? Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out. Does that make sense? I'll just figure it out. The Democrats want to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations, shut down your coal mines -- and, by the way, they will shut down your coal mines. You know that. That's one thing I can guarantee.
We can talk about taxes, and I'll be here, veto, veto, veto. But they ultimately want to raise your taxes very substantially. But I can tell you, they will shut down your coal mines. They want to take away your good health care, and essentially use socialism to turn America into Venezuela and Democrats want to totally open the borders.
They have the caravans, let them in. Do you want to let them in? Does anybody want to let them in?
I don't get it. Think of it -- you campaign on open borders and higher taxes. How the hell do you win that -- how do you win?
You're right. Thank you, and we started the wall and built 1.6 billion and we have another 1.6 billion and then get another 1.6 billion. I want to build it all at one time, but wait till -- wait till you see -- go home and see tonight what our great military is doing on the border. Wait till you see. Go home and enjoy it. So the Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan and I don't know if you know -- you see the big caravan coming in? Three more are forming and you know what we give to these countries?
Hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras and to El Salvador, right? We have -- to others we give hundreds of millions of dollars. Do you know what they to give? Nothing -- nothing. They give us nothing. They give us nothing. That's going to be stopping, that's going to be stopping. But caravan after caravan is forming unvetted, illegal aliens trying to flood into our country on your dollar, over whelming your schools, depleting your resources, and endangering your community.
Homeland Security has just confirmed that members of the lawless caravan, the one you've been watching, come from 20 different countries and influet among them criminals and gang members convicted of crimes ranging from armed robbery to sexual assault. And I don't know if you saw the one -- they interviewed him yesterday and he was asking for pardon.
. And essentially it was for murder who wants -- and he's in the caravan. This is what we have -- and you look -- you look at him, you look like nice, no, no murder, right? You saw that, good I hope you saw that.
And then they gave me a hard time because I put it up on Twitter and they gave me a hard time. They said you shouldn't be doing that, that's not nice. And I say, all I'm doing is just telling the trust, what can I say. Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, and no caravans. The choice in this election could not be more simple, a Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime.
A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs. That's pretty good, that's nice and simple, doesn't get simpler than that. So this Tuesday you have to go out -- I know in West Virginia you tend to vote on Tuesday more so than I guess you could do the early thing, but everyone here likes to go out -- me too.
There's something nice about its called Election Day. We're all old fashioned. That's why we get along. That's why we get along, but you have to go out on Tuesday and vote. And I'll tell you, Patrick's going to be fantastic. And you know what, he'll always vote for us. Not for me, for us. He'll always -- he's not going to be voting with Schumer or Pelosi and open borders and all the things that they want.
And we're honored to be joined by a friend of mine who I just mentioned before because he is one great gentlemen. You know, he's a very, very successful man before he did this and he did it, and he made a mistake. He ran as a Democrat. And he didn't like it, and now he's a happy man and the Republican Party loves him.
Big Jim Justice, your governor. Where is Jim? Thank you, Jim. Big Jim, you're doing a great job -- stay there, Jim. Just relax. Just relax. Just relax, but I'll tell you what, are you enjoying being governor, Jim? The people love you. 65 percent up, coal exports, 65 and he works on it hard. Thank you, Jim for being here.
Thanks for your support. We love -- we love our governor. Thank you, Jim. And another great friend of mine, somebody that has always been there, just always been there. And she is a fighter. She is very strong, tough but a great woman. He says Melania, that's true also. That's true, because surely I could say Melania too.
Because she's been great. Great first lady, I will say that. And if you think it's easy being a first lady and married to me, it's not that easy. She's fantastic. But Senator Shelley Moore Capito, she was -- where is Shelley? Thanks, Shelley. Great job. Really a fantastic job, I appreciate it. Always there for us, always wanting to vote for West Virginia.
Also joining us is Tim Armstead, who is running as you know for Supreme Court. A man who is highly respected and I just want to put a little word out, he's going for that extension. You know what an extension is, I guess you do a good job, you're supposed to be extended. And he has done so, Tim, wherever you may be -- where's Tim?
Good luck, Tim. Good luck, Tim. Thank you. OK? And Jim specifically said you mind doing that, he's a good man, right? He is a good man. Thank you, good luck. Do you have any opposition -- any strong opposition? It's not strong, it's opposition but not strong. Nobody's going to beat you, Tim. Not after this anyway.
Thank you, Tim. And he's just -- he is a bundle of energy. He doesn't stop. You know, he's tied right now. They're tied in the polls, it's very close. It's very close. And I have to say, I like Joe. The problem is I'm just not going to get Joe's vote.
I'm just not going to get it. I like him; he's a friend of mine. I'm just not going to get his vote. Even with Justice Kavanaugh, you know, I called Joe. I said, ""Joe, do me a favor. I'd like you to vote."" He said, ""well, I may. I may."" But no, but you got to vote before I win, not after we have the vote because it was a real question because nobody has ever been treated worse that Judge Brett Kavanaugh at the time now Justice Kavanaugh.
Nobody, nobody. Get got blindsided like nobody ever got blindsided. What happened to him is disgraceful and what the Democrats did and the way they played that way a disgrace, right? A disgrace. And Joe said, ""I'll think about it. I'll think about it."" I said, ""Joe, I don't want you to vote after we get the votes,"" because I didn't know we were going to have the votes without any Democrats.
We didn't get one Democratic vote, so I said, ""Joe, I need the vote like today."" This was a few days before the vote. ""Well, let me think about it. Let me think about it. I want to wait to do it."" OK, because there's nobody smoother than Joe, you understand. There's nobody smoother than Joe. And, no. He's much smoother than Schumer actually.
Crying Chuck, right, right? When he wants something, he cries. But I've never seen him cry before, then he cried. But Joe said, ""all right, let me think about it. Let me think about it."" And then it came time to vote, and as you know we got the vote. And when that final vote was just coming out, Joe waited about one-tenth of one second.
Now it means that Justice Kavanaugh was going to be Justice Kavanaugh, right? We had all the votes, so we didn't need Joe's vote. And he pressed that button. I think it was about one-eighth of one second after we had the final vote from Susan Collins, who did us a good job, good job. She did a good job. Really did.
And it was really a tough period of time, but Joe -- I said, ""Joe, that doesn't count."" It doesn't count because if we would have needed the vote it was not going to happen. Does that make any sense? Do you guys understand that? I said, ""Joe, do it before we have the vote. I think we've got the vote. Do it before we have the vote."" And he said, ""let me think.
Let me think."" And then when I spoke to him later he tried to say, ""but I was watching for that one-eighth of a second. I was watching."" But he didn't do it. He didn't do it. And I'll tell you what. Patrick Morrisey, I built up your coal business and it's going to get a lot better by the way. A lot. As much as you're doing and as good as you're doing, if you look at what's happening, if you look at other countries wanting our coal -- and I'll tell you, which buys a lot of coal from West Virginia.
Do you know that? Vietnam -- I was with the Prime Minister and the president. You know, when you're with -- well, like when you're the President of the United States -I went to Vietnam, I went to various places in Asia -- but where you're the president here, you're not greeted by a president. You're greeted by a president and the Prime Minister.
They have both. And they said they buy their coal now, because of me, from West Virginia. Well, that's good. But I -- something I didn't know -- I learned a lot since then. That was six months ago -- they said it is -- they've used coal for a long time. They said it's the finest coal in the world. It's the finest coal in the world.
They have a lot of options, but they said it's the finest coal. I said, ""good, if I'm never like around the people, which I expect to be a lot, I will explain that."" But you -- do you understand? Do the miners know what I'm saying what I say that? The finest -- see, somebody like me coming from 5th Avenue.
What the hell do I know about that? All I know is I want to put my miners back to work. And I know it works. And I know -- and I know for national security reasons -- another reason -- coal is something we have to have. We have to have. But they said it's the finest coal in the world. I thought that was great.
Might as well tell you. Now I've told you and I don't feel guilty any longer. But I just want to introduce your next United States senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey. Patrick, come on up.
What a good job that was. So I said how's Patrick Morrisey doing to some of my friends, two people that live here, they -- I said how's he doing. They said he is the Energizer bunny. He is all over the state. You know, sometimes you'll ask that question about candidates -- I won't mention names -- and how're they doing -- oh, they're lazy, they're not working.
They're not working. Even these people say he's got a lot of energy. This man has a lot of energy. And just finally on Joe, I have to say that he was all for Hillary Clinton. He was for Hillary Clinton. She was against coal, she was against the miners, she got no support in this state, and yet Joe was totally in her camp.
. Because he's just focused on one thing, becoming your next United States senator. That's what he's doing. But Patrick's been tough on crime and a fierce defender of the rule of law.
And as your senator, he'll always be the tireless champion for the great people of this great state. He loves this state. And your vote on election day -- thank you very much. He's not my type, but I like him anyway, folks. He's a rough looking guy. But you're going to decide. And -- and everybody's watching West Virginia.
Because you know, this was a race -- when it started I won by a lot. And -- and a lot of people said that this was not one that was going to happen. This was a while ago, and then Patrick came along and did unbelievably in the primary. He has won statewide a number of times so he's been -- he's been through it but he's won statewide.
He knows your state as well as anybody I guess and a lot of people said well, I don't know. It's almost -- lets sort of focus on other states, which were also doing very well I have to say. And then all the sudden we see polls and it's tied -- it's in one case he's up a little bit, another case he's down a little bit but I mean its right there.
Let's assume it's sided. It's going to be whoever gets the people going to the polls on Tuesday. The whole country is watching the great state of West Virginia. It's going to be a very exciting moment. They asked me -- the fake news media asks me recently, like a couple of days it will say, what race are you watching?
Oh I'm watching Florida, I'm watching all of the red, but I said watch West Virginia. It's going to be very inter -- and they said what? I said watch West Virginia, the great place. So you're going to decide, maybe, which party controls the United States Senate. It's a very powerful love and a vote for Joe is a vote for Schumer.
It's a vote for a majority leader who will be not good and we don't want to put anti coal -- these are anti coal people. We are -- they are anti coal people and they vote anti coal and frankly, that's what you're getting and if that's what you end up with it's your vote, not mine. Remember that, remember that.
Joe will never be with us in terms of the vote, he'll be with us in a lot of ways. We'll go to dinner with him, we'll take him out, we like him but he's never going to vote for it so I just want you to remember that, ok? Ok, let's get on with it. Let's get on with it, let's get on with it. Patrick, I think if he ever voted against us I'll come back here, I'll say we're going to impeach him -- impeach, we will impeach Patrick.
He'll never do it. He loves the people too much. He loves your industry too much. He understands the state too well. It's not going to happen. So if you don't want the Democrat mob like you saw in the Senate, vote for Patrick. Just vote for him. Finally, we're thrilled to be joined by the next member of Congress, a person who you really do like a lot I have to say, and she's doing well and I thought I'd just call her up for a second.
Third district in West Virginia, Carol Miller, she's done a fantastic job, Carol.
Thank you, Carol. Be careful. You know that. She'll always support our vets. She's very strong on our vets. We love our vets. Our military and our law enforcement. And Carol's opponent is a radical left winger named Richard Ojeda.
If you don't want to be saying the words Speaker Pelosi for the next two years, who will end your coal business, then you better vote for Carol Miller. Thank you, Carol. Thank you. Thank you, Carol. She's doing great. If Democrats gain power, they'll also be planning a takeover of American healthcare and that would be socialism, what they want to do. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 121,000 West Virginia seniors who depend on it. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and by the way, who paid for it. Right?
You paid for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We're all doing that. I listened to President Obama speak today. He had a very small crowd. I have to be honest with you. They don't tell you that. You know? They don't tell you that. We had -- in Houston we had the biggest thing you've ever seen and they were saying Donald Trump spoke today in front of a few thousand people.
Few thousand? We had over 100,000 people that wanted to come. We had 22,000 people in the arena. We had thousands and thousands of people outside of the arena. Donald Trump spoke today in front of a crowd of a few thousand people. Can you believe it? It's called the fake news, folks. But I head President Obama speak today.
I had to listen -- I was in the plane; I had nothing else to do. I heard him talk about telling the truth. He was talking about you have to tell the truth. And yet 28 times he said you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor. You can keep your plan if you like your plan. They were all lies. Over and over again you heard that.
Just used it to pass a terrible healthcare plan that we are decimating strike by strike. You saw what happened to the individual mandate, the most unpopular part. And we actually had Obamacare killed except for one Republican vote and any Democrat -- one Democrat and we would have had it obliterated and you would have had great healthcare.
But we're doing a lot to make it a lot better until we do get rid of it. Then I heard him talk about the freedom of the press. We have to maintain the press. We have to love those people. Love. Except that nobody was worse to the President Obama. Nobody. In fact, he even used, as I remember, the Justice Department to go after reporters.
Remember? Remember? When he's talking about how I should be nice to the fake news. No thank you. And let's not forget President Obama's false promises about our trade deals. Just one. His administration promised that with South Korea we would create in a trade deal 70,000 jobs. But instead of that, it killed over 100,000 jobs in our country.
It was a horrible deal, which by the way, I have totally renegotiated and made it a good deal. Lie after lie, broken promise after broken promise, that's what he did. Unlike President Obama, we live by a different moto. It's called promises made, promises kept. And we've done more than we ever said we would.
We said we were going to do things and we've done a lot more and they will be the first to tell you tell. Democrats' plan -- that's right, the magic wand, right? Remember, he said you need a magic wand to produce manufacturing jobs. Well, we just hit almost 600,000. Democrats' plan to destroy healthcare, also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
I'm sure you don't mind that. As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our laws and to over run our borders. They want to sign illegal aliens up for free healthcare, free welfare, free education and the right to vote. Otherwise, they don't get much. Illegal immigration cost American tax payers more than $100 billion every single year, more than 20 times the entire state budget of the sate of West Virginia.
We need to use our precious resources to help low income Americans who respect our laws, not caravans who break in to our country and break our laws. We don't want that. We don't want that, I'm sorry. Now, we don't mind if they come in, but they have to come in legally. Democrat immigration policies not only drain our treasury, but they threaten our communities.
Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters though the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra lethal fentanyl killing a youth drug, fentanyl -- the worst. These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans every single year.
Last year alone, our brave ICE officers who they want to get rid of by the way, these are tough, great, strong patriots. We need strength, arrested more than 127,000. Think of that, 127,000-- Aliens- With criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes and 1,800 homicides.
They want to get rid of them, let's get rid of ICE. What are these people thinking? That's why you have to have Patrick Morrisey and Carol. You have to vote them in on Tuesday. You have to do it. Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE, they want to turn America in to a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, drug dealers and MS-13 killers.
And by the way, we remove thousands over the last little bit less than two years that I've been here. Thousands and thousands of MS-13 gang members have been thrown the hell out of the country. A blue wave equals a crime wave -- you don't hear too much about the blue wave anymore though, do you? Remember a couple of months -- oh, the blue wave, oh the blue wave.
Now they don't talk -- you know, I'm not saying they don't squeak it by, maybe because they got of races and I can't go everywhere. Can't go everywhere. I mean, you know let's see what happens. Going t be an interesting day at the office. You remember that election two years ago?
There were a lot of really happy people that night, but there were some that were slightly -- not too happy. Cry, baby, cry. A red wave equals jobs and safety. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement.
You have great law enforcement right here... in West Virginia. I look at those people -- I'm looking at your law enforcement right there. I feel very safe. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. And, yes, the wall is happening. It should happen immediately. It's moving beautifully. The design is beautiful, and it's happening.
And some communities in California, of all places, down to miss San Diego, we're just about finishing it up. But they're demanding the wall. They want the wall. I said, ""Let's not give it to them because then they'll put pressure on their government to build it,"" right? Now once we build it for them, they'll say, ""We shouldn't have a wall."" But they already have their wall.
That's the way it works, folks. Border security is also a woman's issue. You know, they keep talking about women. Trump with women. Remember the last election? ""Well, Donald Trump won't do very well with women."" I did great with women. I did great. Right? I did great with women. In fact, at the end, when I won, they -- they said, ""You know, a statistic we got wrong, women really came out for Trump."" I said, ""Thank you.
Thank you."" Same thing now. Because women want safe neighborhoods for their families, right? They want great schools, health care for their children. They want to keep drug dealers and predators and traffickers -- how about the traffickers? These are human traffickers. These are the worst scum in the world.
They want them out of our country. And we do that. The Democrats don't do that. They want the open borders. Fly right in, folks. Come on in. We don't care who the hell you are, come on in. Think of it, 300 people. You know, we're getting a lot of heat because, I was saying, there were some bad people in that caravan.
Right? So we checked, 300 people. I read them out to you. That is one more reason why women all across the nation are going to show up and vote Republican on Tuesday. They want security. They want safety. They don't want to have these people coming in. They don't want to have -- some of these people are just horrible people.
You have to see the crimes they've committed. This election is about security, and it's about prosperity. For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth and shutter our factories and steal our jobs. And you watched helplessly. We don't watch helplessly any more. Those days are over.
We've added half a million manufacturing jobs -- soon to be 600,000 -- since the election, including 32,000 in just the last month.
These were jobs that the previous administration said would never happen. And these are great jobs. These are among our greatest jobs. Manufacturing jobs. And thanks to our tariffs that we put on steel that was coming in, and they were dumping it all over the place and destroying our steel companies and our aluminum industry.
Roaring back. Steel industry is roaring back. And for the miners, by the way, in Minnesota and other places, we're grabbing that iron ore and they're making steel. And the hottest industry -- one of the hottest industries now, look at what's happened to steel. Steel, like coal, it was going off the cliff.
You weren't going to have a steel industry in this country and we need it. Certain industries you need, you need steel. You don't have steel -- you need it for defense. What are we going to go incase we're -- hopefully we'll never have a problem, ok. I made the military -- it'll be stronger than it ever was before ever and that's why you won't have a problem.
You know, if you don't want to have a problem, make your military much stronger than anybody else ever thought possible, but we need steel. How about this? We don't have any -- so see our steel bills were finished. We were going down -- you guys understand that, but we were going down. Now it's so hot, but you need steel.
There are certain industries you have to have -- you need defense. You don't have it -- you have purpose, what are we gonna do? We have a conflict and we call China? We need more steel. Please, please, could we have some more steel? It's ridiculous. Our steel industry is roaring back and we're putting billions of dollars in our treasury because we're charging 25 percent tax on those people that dump their steel.
They dump is all over the place in order to destroy our steel industry and the miner are coming back, in this case, since the iron ore and it's coming out and it's gonna -- it's a beautiful thing to see. I mean we've rebuilt -- we really started that about eight months ago, really heavy started it. I wanted to get my feet a little bit wet as President, right.
We started it about eight months ago. It's incredible. The head of U.S. Steel called up, he said I've never said anything like it -- what you've been able to do in such a short period of time. They're building seven new plants, they're expanding plants. Nucor -- Nucor, a big steel company is building brand new plants $750 million, $900 million brand new plants.
It's incredible. They haven't been built in years. Last month, I announced that we're replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst -- stupidest deals ever made with an incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada agreement. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices and we're doing very nicely.
We'll probably make a deal. They want to make a deal. America is being respected again. We're respected as a country again. We were not respected for a long time. We were laughed at just like these stupid immigration laws. The whole world looks at it, they laugh, they said what is this all about? A person comes into our country -- another country throws them out.
Hey, get out. You're not supposed to be here, you have to go through a process. You know what we do? We take them -- we can't do anything -- we bring them through a court proceeding. We take a person who walks onto our property we have a big deal -- a court case. They have lawyers, we have lawyers and what happens is then they go away and is supposed to come back for the trial.
Could be two years, three years later and they disappear into the country never to be seen again. There's no trial, very few people come back -- almost none. This is the procedure. This is the law. This is crazy. And the Democrats don't want to change it because they know its chaos and a disaster and they think that's good, but I think it's good for us because I think they overplayed their hand.
And how these caravans were formed, you'll have to figure that out. But they overplayed their hand too, assuming they had something to do with it but it was very well organized, amazingly, in Honduras and the different places very well. And you know they came up and I'll tell you people are really energized.
They're energized about that, they're energized about the way justice, as you know Kavanaugh. Just as Kavanaugh was treated, they're energized when they saw the way he was -- Brett Kavanaugh -- when they saw the way he was treated, they're energized about a lot of things. They want to see us be a great, respected country.
And that's what's happening. We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients get life saving treatments. We passed something that they've been trying to pass for many, many years. It's called right to try where you can try stuff. That isn't out yet, but it's looking promising.
That's such an important thing. They've been trying to pass that for decades. I got it done. After years of surging premiums, the cost of healthcare is finally coming down. We're getting the cost of healthcare down. And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic. It's the largest bill in American history.
We passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. And the landmark VA accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreat our veterans will be held accountable. You are fired. Get out. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military. And we gave our great warriors, I know you have some of them right here.
And I know they don't care about this, they couldn't care less, they don't mind; maybe we'll take it back. We gave them the largest pay raise they've had in more than a decade. OK? Our military. They deserve it. And my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth ranch of the American armed forces, the Space force.
. And just today, we riposted all sanctions that were lifted under that horrible deal. Just today. We now have in place the toughest ever sanctions on a corrupt regime in Iran. We've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Many, many presidents said they were going to do that, they never got it done. I got it done. I even got it built. I already built the embassy. $1 billion under budget, right? One billion. One billion under budget. It was supposed to go as $1.1 billion, we go tit done for less than $500,000. That's not bad, that's -- it's a long story, I won't bother telling you this.
But it's pretty amazing. And there are many things like that. Together, we have made extraordinary progress. And we're just getting started. But the democrats want to turn back the clock and put America in reverse and give power back to corrupt, selfish ruling class people. And they want to take the power back for themselves.
But we are not going backwards, we're going forwards. I need your vote for a republican house. I need your vote for a republican senate. So we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. And I say it all the time. And they can challenge it. Greatest movement in the history of our country.
You know, Bernie Sanders had a reasonably good movement. But Hilary clipped him. Yes, don't look in that one, he got clipped. But we would've beaten him easy. He would've been easier. Crazy Bernie. We will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations and raising your incomes. We will protect Medicare and your social security.
Remember what I said during the debates? Everyone was talking about cutting the social security and all -- I said we're not touching your social security. We haven't touched it in a long time now.
We will defend your right to free speech, religious liberty and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border, we will pass case law, we stop sanctuary cities, we will stop catch and release, and visa lottery, and chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We will lift millions of our citizens from Welfare to work. Dependents to independents and poverty to prosperity, that's what's going to happen. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for American. We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for West Virginia, and we are proudly standing up for our national anthem.
To continue our incredible momentum, I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and go out and vote Republican for all of them and our two stars right here. On Tuesday, I need the people of West Virginia to send a message to crying Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and the radical Democrats by voting for Carol Miller and Patrick Morrisey.
Loyal citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you -- the American people like we said we were going to do. This great state was built by some of the toughest men and strongest woman ever to walk the face of the earth. These proud West Virginia patriots braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home with their own two hands.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country, and they loved their God, right? They loved their God. They loved their God is right. These courageous American's did not shed their blood, sweat and tears, so that we could sit at home will others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake our children we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender, and we will always fight on to victory, always, always.
Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God and together we will make America wealthy again. Make America strong again. Make American safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, West Virginia. Thank you very much.
","Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Huntington, West Virginia",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-huntington-wv-november-2-2018
Barack Obama,United States of America,2013-01-29,"Well. It is good to be back in Las Vegas. And it is good to be among so many good friends.Let me start off by thanking everybody at Del Sol High School for hosting us. Go Dragons! Let me especially thank your outstanding principal, Lisa Primas.
There are all kinds of notable guests here, but I just want to mention a few. First of all, our outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, is here.Our wonderful Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar. Former Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis.Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus. Your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman.
But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important the issue we’re going to talk about today is. Marie Lopez Rogers from Avondale, Arizona. Kasim Reed from Atlanta, Georgia. Greg Stanton from Phoenix, Arizona. And Ashley Swearengin from Fresno, California.And all of you are here, as well as some of the top labor leaders in the country. And we are just so grateful. Some outstanding business leaders are here as well. And of course, we’ve got wonderful students here, so I could not be prouder of our students.
Now, those of you have a seat, feel free to take a seat. I don’t mind.
Now, last week, I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as President of the United States.And during my inaugural address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesn’t require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have, but it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose. It requires us to act.
I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others. Some debates will be more contentious. That’s to be expected. But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling; where a broad consensus is emerging; and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America. I’m here today because the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform.The time is now. Now is the time. Now is the time. Now is the time.
I’m here because most Americans agree that it’s time to fix a system that’s been broken for way too long. I’m here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement, and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity. Now is the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country’s future.
Think about it -- we define ourselves as a nation of immigrants. That’s who we are -- in our bones. The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, that’s always been one of our greatest strengths. It keeps our workforce young. It keeps our country on the cutting edge. And it’s helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known.
After all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo!. They created entire new industries that, in turn, created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens. In recent years, one in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants. One in four new small business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada -- folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans.
But we all know that today, we have an immigration system that’s out of date and badly broken; a system that’s holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class.
Right now, we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America; 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows. Yes, they broke the rules. They crossed the border illegally. Maybe they overstayed their visas. Those are facts. Nobody disputes them. But these 11 million men and women are now here. Many of them have been here for years. And the overwhelming majority of these individuals aren’t looking for any trouble. They’re contributing members of the community. They're looking out for their families. They're looking out for their neighbors. They're woven into the fabric of our lives.
Every day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living. Often they do that in a shadow economy -- a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay. And when that happens, it’s not just bad for them, it’s bad for the entire economy. Because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing -- that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules -- they’re the ones who suffer. They've got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules. And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened, too.
So if we're truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it into the middle class, we've got to fix the system.
We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules. We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable -- businesses for who they hire, and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law. That’s common sense. And that’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.
There’s another economic reason why we need reform. It’s not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy. It’s also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so, and the effect that has on our economy.
Right now, there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities. They’re earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science. But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, there’s a good chance they’ll have to leave our country. Think about that.
Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Right now in one of those classrooms, there’s a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea -- their Intel or Instagram -- into a big business. We’re giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then we’re going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else? That’s not how you grow new industries in America. That’s how you give new industries to our competitors. That’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.
Now, during my first term, we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system.First, we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants. We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history. And today, illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000.
Second, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities. And today, deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever.
And third, we took up the cause of the DREAMers -- the young people who were brought to this country as children, young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here. We said that if you’re able to meet some basic criteria like pursuing an education, then we’ll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong.
But because this change isn’t permanent, we need Congress to act -- and not just on the DREAM Act. We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now. That's what we need.
Now, the good news is that for the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together. Members of both parties, in both chambers, are actively working on a solution. Yesterday, a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles I’ve proposed and campaigned on for the last few years. So at this moment, it looks like there’s a genuine desire to get this done soon, and that’s very encouraging.
But this time, action must follow. We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate. We've been debating this a very long time. So it's not as if we don't know technically what needs to get done. As a consequence, to help move this process along, today I’m laying out my ideas for immigration reform. And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas I’m proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush. You don't get that matchup very often.So we know where the consensus should be.
Now, of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details, and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process. But it’s important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place. And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.
So the principles are pretty straightforward. There are a lot of details behind it. We're going to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we're talking about. But the principles are pretty straightforward.
First, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement. That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders. It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers. To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out who’s here legally, who’s not. So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someone’s employment status. And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties.
Second, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally. We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship. But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship.
We’ve got to lay out a path -- a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line, behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally. That's only fair, right?
So that means it won’t be a quick process but it will be a fair process. And it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship.
And the third principle is we’ve got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time. For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldn’t have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America. You shouldn't have to wait years.
If you’re a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology, or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here. Because if you succeed, you’ll create American businesses and American jobs. You’ll help us grow our economy. You’ll help us strengthen our middle class.
When we talk about that in the abstract, it’s easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of “us” versus “them.” And when that happens, a lot of folks forget that most of “us” used to be “them.” We forget that.
It’s really important for us to remember our history. Unless you’re one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else. Somebody brought you.
Ken Salazar, he’s of Mexican American descent, but he points that his family has been living where he lives for 400 years, so he didn't immigrate anywhere.
The Irish who left behind a land of famine. The Germans who fled persecution. The Scandinavians who arrived eager to pioneer out west. The Polish. The Russians. The Italians. The Chinese. The Japanese. The West Indians. The huddled masses who came through Ellis Island on one coast and Angel Island on the other. All those folks, before they were “us,” they were “them.”And when each new wave of immigrants arrived, they faced resistance from those who were already here. They faced hardship. They faced racism. They faced ridicule. But over time, as they went about their daily lives, as they earned a living, as they raised a family, as they built a community, as their kids went to school here, they did their part to build a nation.They were the Einsteins and the Carnegies. But they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember, but whose actions helped make us who we are; who built this country hand by hand, brick by brick. They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth, but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story.
In high school, Alan watched his friends come of age -- driving around town with their new licenses, earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall. He knew he couldn’t do those things. But it didn’t matter that much. What mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God-given potential.
Last year, when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows -- even if it's just for two years at a time -- he was one of the first to sign up.

",Address on Comprehensive Immigration Reform,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamaimmagrationreform.htm
Edwin Wainwright,United Kingdom,2016-01-30,"I have waited a long time to speak, Mr. Speaker, but I am very grateful to you for selecting me, even though at such a late hour. As this is my maiden speech, I ask the House to grant me its forbearance. I am supposed to be non-controversial, and obliging, and I expect reciprocity on this occasion. If, inadvertently, I break that rule I trust that hon. Members will forgive me.
I should be very remiss if, on this occasion, I did not say a few words about my predecessor. I refer to the Right Hon. Wilfred Paling, formerly Member of Parliament for Dearne Valley. He came into this House in 1922 and remained here until just recently, except for a period in 1931–33, when, unfortunately, an hon. Member opposite defeated him at Doncaster. Wilfred Paling is a man of very high integrity. He is sincere and has a great honesty of purpose. He also has a great ability. This House has rung many times with his voice on behalf of the working people. In fact, he, along with the Right Hon. Tom Williams and Tom Smith, were considered to be “the terrible three”.
Mr. Wilfred Paling has recently had an attack of pneumonia, from which, I am glad to say, he is recovering. On behalf of every right hon. and hon. Member of the House, I think that I can say to him the next time I see him that we wish him and his good lady good health and a long retirement.
During the last two days we have been discussing the Local Employment Bill. When we read new Bills, it is often hard to discover why they were necessary. In view of the fact that the Bill has been introduced, and the Government have assured us that they will maintain full employment, we must accept what they say in good faith. I hope that that good faith will be with us in twelve months’ or two years’ time and that they do not treat the Bill, when it becomes an Act, as they have treated other Acts in the past.
There are three things that I should like to say about the Bill. The first concerns Part I, where the words a high rate of unemployment exists or is imminent appear. What do the Government mean by “a high rate of unemployment”? Do they mean 7, 8 or 9 per cent., or 30 or 40 per cent., which we experienced during the depression period, or do they mean what the Board of Trade says is a reasonable percentage of 4 per cent.? The Government should tell the House what they mean by a “high rate of unemployment”.
Secondly, what do the Government mean by the word “locality”? Do they mean that where there are high pockets of unemployment the term “locality” covers a wide expansive area, thus ensuring that the average rate of unemployment is low, or do they mean that they will consider each pocket of high unemployment on its own?
Thirdly, in Part III the Government promise “to be responsible for the difference of 85 per cent. between the cost of the erection of a building and its market value after completion. In a Development Area, one appreciates that there would be a difference between those two values and this provision probably would encourage private enterprise to come along and erect a factory or plant. In an area where there is only a little unemployment, 400 or 500 unemployed could be absorbed if two or three factories were erected. If there is a stable economy, about which we have heard so much from the Government, the difference between the cost of erection and the market value may be insignificant. If it were so insignificant that it would not attract private industrialists, what would the Government do to encourage the erection of factories?
In my division we have 3 to 4 per cent. unemployment. Sixty-five per cent. of the industry is coal mining, but the employment of mine workers has been restricted, with the result that at present 540 men are out of work. In addition, 81 boys, 348 women and 46 girls in the Dearne Valley, which is supposed to be an area of practically full employment, are unemployed. What perturbs me particularly is that we have boys and girls who are unemployed. In fact, 21 boys and 5 girls who are still unemployed left school in July. If we waste our youth like that, what is the good of our educational programme? What is the good of attempting to train technologists and scientists if we allow our youths to be unemployed?
In my neighbouring constituency—and I mention this with the permission of my hon. The position, therefore, in that area is worse than the position in my own constituency.
The West Riding County Council administrative area has had no help from the Government under the Distribution of Industry Act or the 1958 Act. Personnel are going out of the West Riding County Council administrative area into the large towns and cities for employment. Girls are travelling by bus from my own constituency at 5.15 in the morning to the Halifax and Bradford areas for employment and are returning late at night, between 7 and 8 o’clock. That is not a good thing.
We say, therefore, that light industries should be allowed to come to my division to make certain that there is employment for our female workers, for our aged and sick miners and for persons not physically fit to work in heavy industries. We hope that the Bill will help us to obtain the light industries which are needed in the Dearne Valley area. The contraction of the mining industry, unless it is planned contraction, can have a grievous effect on the economy. I would remind hon. Members opposite that 80 per cent. of the oil that comes into this country comes from a politically unstable area, and in the event of anything untoward happening in that area the economy would immediately be in a very parlous state.
I ask the Government to do a bit of rethinking about their present attitude towards the coal mining industry. Coal is our indigenous fuel, and we should make certain that it plays its full part in the fuel supplied to industry. If it is necessary that the coal mining industry is contracted, let us carry out the purposes of the Bill and ensure that employment is maintained in the mining areas before the pits are closed. Once a mine is closed it is too late to say that we will build a plant or factory there. It is essential to ensure that chaos, social upheaval and degradation do not occur in our small towns and villages.
It has been said by an hon. Member that there is nothing worse than unemployment, except war. To a fit and able man unemployment is degrading. A man feels that it besmirches his character. It upsets his soul and warps his opinions. It is the duty of any Government to ensure full employment wherever labour happens to be at any given time.
I may have been a little controversial. If so, I hope that hon. Members will forgive me. I will save any further comments, caustic or otherwise, for some future occasion. But I must impress upon the Government and upon hon. Members generally that we in the mining industry desire—I nearly used the word “demand”—the Government to consider fully a national fuel policy. I regret that the Minister of Power is not in the House today. It is essential that coal should play its part if we are to make full use of our indigenous fuel.
I suggest that opencast mining should be stopped immediately. Compensation for loss of contracts, which would be the responsibility of the Coal Board, should be taken over by the Government. The situation could be eased by making certain that the personnel and machines at present used in opencast mining were transferred to building our roads, thus making certain that our roads were such that when factories were built the materials required in those factories could be delivered there. If the Government will consider that suggestion and will put it into effect, I am certain that we can build up our economy and maintain full employment.
I hope also that the Government will bear in mind the question of residual oil. The Secretary of State referred to finance in connection with the stocking of coal, oil dumping and opencast mining. We are waiting to see what the Government intend to do on each of those three points.
I am grateful to the House for having listened to me so patiently and I hope that hon. Members will take note of what I have said.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-03-04,"Well, it was an honor and I'll tell you, that's a great team. And, I just met some very large people, and, great people and champions, most importantly, they're great champions and, you can be very proud. And when I -- when I heard about this, actually, John Hoeven came in, and Kevin Cramer, and they wanted to know if -- if we could host.
We held a beautiful little ceremony for Clemson, as you know, and national champions. And, I said, absolutely, because I happened to see that final game, and I said that team is good. That's a good team, from North Dakota. And I also love the state. I love the people of the state. We've had great luck there.
I was very happy to see Kevin get elected, in a very  -- a very big sweep. He really did a great job. So you have two great senators, and you now have a really wonderful congressman. And your governor too. I mean we have -- you've got a great group of people, a great group of people, and it's a very special place.
I know you do. You do. But I -- I was there a lot. And I like the state, I like the people a lot.
I do know that about North Dakota. I do, actually, and it is a swamp and it's a disgrace. When you look at all these witch hunts and just -- there's nothing with Russia. So now they -- you've probably heard the senator -- Senator Byrd came out from the Senate Intelligence. He said We see nothing, no collusion.
This is after two years. We see no collusion. There is no collusion, and they knew there was no collusion two years ago. It's all a hoax. And the people of North Dakota know it, and frankly the people of the country know. The Democrats know it too but they just don't want to say it.
Well, I'd say the economy. You know we're setting records every day. You never hear anything about it on television. I mean, look at how well North Dakota's doing. We're -- where you've had very bad days before me. The economy is doing phenomenally. Unemployment's at the all time low. You look at Hispanic or African-American or Asian or women or so many others.
I mean, historic lows, and, you know, I think the economy would be a thing that's not very reported. But they don't report anything if it's positive. You know, they don't report -- and if it is positive, they try and make it negative. So, we have a very negative press, but fortunately we have a brilliant population that understands it, or I wouldn't be standing here talking to you.
Well, first of all, they're great patriots and they are with me all the way. They know we've been taken advantage of by China in particular, but by many countries, not just China. We're doing Mexico. We're doing Canada. I mean Canada's been really taking advantage of this country for many years. People just didn't know it. But China is the big one.
And we are being very tough on China, with billions and billions of dollars of tariffs, and lots of other things. Their economy is not good right now. I guess a lot of people would blame me for that, because the Chinese economy is not good, because people are realize that they're gonna have to pay up, and the biggest beneficiary is going to be the farmer, and the farmers know that.
In fact, just -- a meeting last week with the Vice Premier of China. He said he's going to buy tremendous amounts of soybean, even before we do the deal. You probably heard about that. I hope you did through --  through Sonny, who's your great -- Sonny Perdue, your great agricultural commissioner -- Secretary.
He's been so fantastic. So we're taking care of our farmers. But what I love about the farmers, they said we know that it's been a horrible thing, Mr. President. Set it right. We'll sort of suffer through this with you, and they stopped buying, and everything else. They want to make a deal so badly, you wouldn't believe it. And so, we'll see what happens.
But they're already back to buying from our farmers, and if we get the deal done, it will be purchases like never in our history. Not even close.
That was -- that was a good one. We did it in three months, and it was under construction for eight years, and it's a very similar thing. Well, I will say this. The Corps working very hard. It is a different kind of a thing. We're buying, and we're buying at a much better clip. I want to take a look at that letter, because I agree with you.
I think you could do it much faster. But the Corps is working very, very hard, and it's all intertwined with everything else, and it is more complicated, actually, than just a wall. We had to do certain things. We had to hold back rivers, like the Rio Grande. We had to hold back waters, and a lot of different things with -- so we had to build small dams all over the place.
But we are actually doing a lot, and we're going to have a couple of hundred miles built in the not-too-distant future. We're really moving along quickly. But I'm going to take a look at that letter, because you know what? If I can get somebody in there that could really do something very quickly, I'm okay with that, and I'll bet you that person could, because I agree with that person.
I want to take a look at that letter. If you would get it to me I would like it.
Good. Don't give it to somebody else. If you give it to somebody else, I won't get it.
Good thank you. And I love the team. What a group of people.
What a group of people. Great champions. Thank you very much. It's an honor to have them the White House. Thank you.
Thank you Scott. You've been such a good friend. Appreciate it.

Chris Grayling,United Kingdom,2019-04-04,"The Romanian presidency hosted an informal meeting of Transport Ministers in Bucharest on Wednesday 27 March. This was not a formal Council meeting and no decisions were taken. This statement provides a summary of discussions. The UK was represented by officials.
The meeting discussed multimodality, sustainability, infrastructure and road safety. On multimodality, participants underlined the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to multimodal transport. Integrated ticketing systems, promotion of car-sharing or public transport, digitalisation and interoperability were identified as means for developing multimodality.
On sustainability, participants discussed the importance of action to reduce the impact of transport on climate change, recognising the challenges raised by an increasing need for mobility and the negative impact on the climate. Policy and practical approaches to encouraging multimodal transport were discussed, with many interventions focusing on possible measures to be taken in order to decarbonise ​transport such as: promotion of alternative fuels, digitalisation, better planning of services, uptake of new technologies, and incentives for use of public transport or cycling.
The Commission set out its thinking on the revision of the TEN-T regulation, following the launch of its review process in March, and its plans for consultation with stakeholders and member states in the next few months. Participants welcomed the Commission’s initiative to start the revision process of the TEN-T regulation and discussed future funding options for the promotion of priority projects.
Over lunch the meeting heard some presentations on road safety. The European Commission stressed the importance of member states implementing the “Vision zero” to reduce fatalities and severe injuries on roads. The European Commission will be seeking to re-focus its efforts in this area by introducing a new policy framework on road safety for 2021-30. In addition, it will seek to foster a partnership with the European Investment Bank to provide the “Safer Transport Facility” with the aim of providing a “one stop shop” to support member states in achieving the objective.
The UK did not intervene substantively.

Zachary Taylor,United States of America,1849-03-05 00:00:00,"Elected by the American people to the highest office known to our laws, I appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution, and, in compliance with a time-honored custom, to address those who are now assembled.
The confidence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be the Chief Magistrate of a Republic holding a high rank among the nations of the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound gratitude; but when I reflect that the acceptance of the office which their partiality has bestowed imposes the discharge of the most arduous duties and involves the weightiest obligations, I am conscious that the position which I have been called to fill, though sufficient to satisfy the loftiest ambition, is surrounded by fearful responsibilities. Happily, however, in the performance of my new duties I shall not be without able cooperation. The legislative and judicial branches of the Government present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments and matured experience, and it shall be my endeavor to call to my assistance in the Executive Departments individuals whose talents, integrity, and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the faithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to their charge. With such aids and an honest purpose to do whatever is right, I hope to execute diligently, impartially, and for the best interests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me.
In the discharge of these duties my guide will be the Constitution, which I this day swear to “preserve, protect, and defend.” For the interpretation of that instrument I shall look to the decisions of the judicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of the Government under the earlier Presidents, who had so large a share in its formation. To the example of those illustrious patriots I shall always defer with reverence, and especially to his example who was by so many titles “the Father of his Country.”
To command the Army and Navy of the United States; with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and other officers; to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary; and to take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed—these are the most important functions intrusted to the President by the Constitution, and it may be expected that I shall briefly indicate the principles which will control me in their execution.
Chosen by the body of the people under the assurance that my Administration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country, and not to the support of any particular section or merely local interest, I this day renew the declarations I have heretofore made and proclaim my fixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the Government in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public policy those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of our national existence.
In reference to the Army and Navy, lately employed with so much distinction on active service, care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency, and in furtherance of that object the military and naval schools, sustained by the liberality of Congress, shall receive the special attention of the Executive.
As American freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty, but at the same time we are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations. In all disputes between conflicting governments it is our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral, while our geographical position, the genius of our institutions and our people, the advancing spirit of civilization, and, above all, the dictates of religion direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations with all other powers. It is to be hoped that no international question can now arise which a government confident in its own strength and resolved to protect its own just rights may not settle by wise negotiation; and it eminently becomes a government like our own, founded on the morality and intelligence of its citizens and upheld by their affections, to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before appealing to arms. In the conduct of our foreign relations I shall conform to these views, as I believe them essential to the best interests and the true honor of the country.
The appointing power vested in the President imposes delicate and onerous duties. So far as it is possible to be informed, I shall make honesty, capacity, and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the bestowal of office, and the absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal.
It shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measures to Congress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and protection to the great interests of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, to improve our rivers and harbors, to provide for the speedy extinguishment of the public debt, to enforce a strict accountability on the part of all officers of the Government and the utmost economy in all public expenditures; but it is for the wisdom of Congress itself, in which all legislative powers are vested by the Constitution, to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy. I shall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to adopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interests and tend to perpetuate that Union which should be the paramount object of our hopes and affections. In any action calculated to promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly loves his country I will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the Government.
In conclusion I congratulate you, my fellow-citizens, upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of Divine Providence has conducted our common country. Let us invoke a continuance of the same protecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence we this day occupy, and let us seek to deserve that continuance by prudence and moderation in our councils, by well-directed attempts to assuage the bitterness which too often marks unavoidable differences of opinion, by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal principles, and by an enlarged patriotism, which shall acknowledge no limits but those of our own widespread Republic.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2011-08-05,"Many people have been asking what can they do when the economy is going so bad so fast like our economy, what can they do to stay successful to be successful to get ahead to make money. Honestly, it's tough. You have to stay focused, you have to study, you have to work hard, maybe get the second job, you've got to write it out.
It's not easy and it's a -- it sounds like an easy question. It's not easy. The economy of this country stinks, it's going bad.
Our jobs are going to Asia, our jobs and manufacturing is being made in other parts of the world. I saw the other day, a Learjet, the wings are made in Mexico, other parts are made in Canada. Everything's made everywhere else, but they're not made in the United States, Learjet, that's like apple pie.
It's very, very sad. Now. I hate to recommend this, but sometimes you have to go where the action is.
So maybe you have to go to a country that's stealing all our jobs. The sad part is they won't give you jobs because you're an American. So if you went to China and you want to get a job in China, the Chinese government will say we don't want him to work.
He's an American, it's a very unfair system. Believe me, our leaders are not smart and our competition is very smart. We are being led down the road to absolute poverty, not a good situation, but stay focused work hard.

Not even a fake doctor, Dr. Robert Mojica, Director of the Budget. To my right, Melissa de Rosa, Secretary to the Governor. To my far right, real doctor, Howard Zucker, Commissioner of Health.
Good morning to all of you. Happy Memorial Day weekend, starts today. Summer is now upon us. This will be the 155th Memorial Day. Press gets to ask me questions. Here’s my question for you guys today. Where was the first officially recognized Memorial day celebration?
No answer. Let the record show there is not a single submission from the assembled press. You guys should know. Waterloo. New York, Seneca County, 1866. President Johnson declared Waterloo, New York the birthplace of the Memorial Day parade. And as you are a press corp from the State of New York, I would hope that you remember this going forward and there’s the sign just in case you forget, Waterloo, New York, birth place of Memorial Day.
Today is day 83 of the COVID-19 crisis. Some of my young guns saying, oh, it’s 83 days. We haven’t had a day off. It’s Memorial Day weekend. Life is about stamina, stamina. It’s Memorial Day weekend. Imagine if you were in a real war, overseas war, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War. Day 83, it’s nothing, tour of duty. News is good today. Hospitalizations are down. Net change in hospitalizations is down.
Number of new cases per day is down. This is a level now that is lower than when we first began. So that’s good. Number of deaths painfully high at any number, right? And you see that this number has been stubborn on its way down, but it’s 109 yesterday. They were all in our thoughts and prayers. Again, you see how quick that spike went up and you see how slow it is to come down. So we want to make sure we don’t go back there ever, ever again. We’re talking about reopening. Question is not whether or not to reopen, the question is how you reopen smart, how fast and safe can you reopen. Reopen as fast as you can, as long as it is safe and you are safe if you’re acting smart.
What does smart mean? Phasing it in by metrics, just study what’s happening. Continue to test so you have an idea of the growth of the virus. Trace those cases, isolate those positives, watch your hospital capacity, and monitor what’s going on so all your actions are based on data. We post all the data. Anyone in the state can go online, see where they are by their region. Long Island and Mid-Hudson region, if the number of deaths continues to decline the way it has and they get their tracing online. Every region has a certain number of tracers that they need to reopen because we want to make sure when they reopen, they have the testing and tracing operation working. But if the number of deaths continues to decline, they get their tracing up and online, both regions could reopen this week.
In anticipation of that, we’re going to allow construction staging. Before you can begin construction, you have to have staged the construction. The materials have to be onsite, etcetera, and safety precautions have to be onsite. So we’re going to allow that construction staging now for the Long Island and the Mid-Hudson. We’re hopeful that the number of deaths continues to decline and then they would be reopening this week.
Testing is a big component of all of this. New York State tests more than any of the state per capita, we test more than any other country per capita. So we are far ahead in terms of getting this operation online. And this is the first case, nobody’s ever done this before, putting together this tracing and testing capacity, but we’ve signed up another 52 independent pharmacies. That brings the total number of sites in the State of New York to 750. And our message is very simple. Get a test. We have state run sites where we have more capacity than we’re now performing tests.
We have some drive-ins where we can do 15,000 tests. We’re only doing 5,000 per day. Get a test. If you have any symptoms of COVID, which are basically the same symptoms as the flu. If you have any symptoms, get a test. If you were exposed to a person who you find out was positive, get a test, get a test, and you can go to this website and they’ll tell you exactly the site closest to you.
In terms of tracing, all the reasons that have come online had to have the right number of tracers. That’s why we were talking about Mid-Hudson and Long Island has to get their tracing numbers up. But every region has the tracing functioning. Mike Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, volunteered to have his Bloomberg philanthropies put together a tracing program because there is no such thing as a tracing program. How do you train tracers? How do you recruit tracers? What software do the tracers use? They’ve been doing that with Johns Hopkins. They have been fantastic. We have that in place now. And we’re going to share that with other states online. And we’re going to do that with the National Governors Association because New York is ahead and we do have more advanced curriculum and training and protocols.
So we’re going to work with the NGA and make that available to any state that wants to use it. Small business is a priority. Federal government passed the small business assistance program, that is run out of money and small businesses are taking a real beating in this situation. They are 90% of New York’s businesses and they’re facing the toughest challenges. The economic projections vis-a-vis small business are actually frightening. More than 100,000 have shut permanently since the pandemic hit. Many small businesses just don’t have the staying power to continue to pay all the fixed costs, the lease, et cetera, when they have no income whatsoever.
Minority owned businesses face a far greater risk and have received less in federal relief. So New York State is starting its own small business relief program. Working with private banks, we have over $100 million available to make loans to small businesses. We’re going to focus on MWBs that did not receive federal assistance and focus on really small business. You know, the federal definition of small business has what many could consider large businesses, but we’re going to focus on true small businesses. 20 or fewer employees, less than $3 million in gross revenues. People who are interested in participating in this program can go to the website that is on the screen.
It’s Memorial Day weekend. We expect people to be getting out, going to parks, beaches, etcetera. We understand that, but we have to remain vigilant at the same time. I know the weather is warmer. I know people have been cooped up. I know there’s tremendous energy to get out. You have to remain vigilant. You read in the papers that they’re talking now about a possible second wave or hotspots for places that have opened too fast or opened without testing and tracing or opened without doing monitoring. That would be the worst situation is if we went through everything we went through, you start to reopen, you’re not doing the monitoring and the vigilance, and it actually winds up with another hotspot or cluster. Or worse, frankly.
And remember, we are still learning about this COVID-19 virus. And one of the things I find most infuriating is the facts continue to change with this virus. Nobody’s fault. But since we didn’t know about the virus, we had certain assumptions that quote unquote experts made.
… certain assumptions that quote unquote “experts” made, and those facts change. From day one, it started that this virus was coming from China, so everybody’s looking to the West Coast from the West, and it turns out the virus came from the East. It came from Europe and it walked right through our airports and nobody was screening and no one was doing anything. And that it was not in March, it was coming here January, February, and March. Virus was here much sooner than anybody knew.
A fact was if you have the virus and you have the antibodies, then you’re immune, so we can put together a workforce that can go back to work. People who had the virus and now have the antibodies. Now they’re not so sure if you’re immune, if you have the antibodies.
It started, children were not going to be affected by the coronavirus. Now we’re not so sure that children aren’t affected and we’re watching carefully this inflammatory syndrome that is starting to hit children who are COVID positive, or have the antibodies for positive.
Most recently, CDC says infected surfaces are not a major source of transmission. When we started, it was about infected surfaces and you could get it from infected surfaces and that was a major problem. We have a very aggressive disinfecting campaign going on across the state, public transit, et cetera. Now the CDC says, yeah, that’s not a major source. It’s airborne. It’s droplets. That’s a major source. If the major source, if they’re right, and the major transmission source is airborne, it takes you back to wear a mask. Wear a mask.
This reminds me in some ways of the education campaign we went through after we learned about the HIV virus and transmission of the HIV. I remember how many times and how long we had to talk to people about wearing a prophylactic and how it could make the difference between life and death. The mask can make the difference between life and death. I know it’s a small thing. It’s de minimis, it doesn’t look like much. But if it’s now primarily airborne, you know the mask works.
How do you know the mask works? First responders have a lower infection rate than the general population. Nurses, doctors in emergency rooms have a lower infection rate than the general population. How can that possibly be? Because they wear the mask and they do the hand sanitizing. You feel out of control. You can’t protect yourself. You can’t protect your family. Yes, you can. That’s what the mask does. You want to be in control of yourself. You want to greatly increase your odds, wear the mask.
By the way, we’re not just asking you, the mask is mandatory in public settings, public transportation. If you’re in a taxi or an Uber, private carriers or any time you are in public within six feet of another person, the mask is mandatory. It is not just a nice thing to do, a responsible thing to do for citizen duty, it is mandatory that you wear the mask within six feet of another person in public. You don’t have a right to infect another person. You don’t. Look at the Constitution, tell me where it says you have the right to infect another person. You don’t.
Smart, how do we reopen smart? It’s up to you. It’s up to us. That’s both the beauty and the conundrum of this situation. It is wholly dependent on social action. Wholly dependent on social action. You tell me what people do, I will tell you the results. Period. Government can say whatever it wants, I can sit up here and say whatever I want. I can’t control it. People can control it.
May 5th, we announced a wear a mask in public campaign. We asked people to submit videos and we would pick the winner by vote of the people and the winner would become a public service announcement. We had over 600 submissions for videos. We showed you the five finalists that are now open for voting.
Here’s another question for the astute press corp. The voting has been open for two-and-a-half days. You can go to a website now and you can vote. How many votes have been cast thus far on the website? How many people have gone to the website in two-and-a-half days, watched the videos and voted for the best video? What’s the number of people who went to the website in two-and-a-half days?
No, I said there was 600. This is emblematic of my interaction with the press. I did not say that. I said 600 people submitted videos. Of the 600 submissions, five were picked as finalists. People could then vote on the five finalists. The question is over two-and-a-half days, you’re all political geniuses, over two-and-a-half days, how many people do you think went to the website to vote for one of those five finalists?
Five.
25? 65,000 people. Isn’t that amazing? Zach wins.
The competition is still open. We’re going to show you now five of the runner-ups. I tell you of the 600, all 600 are going to be put up. They are amazing what people did. Really amazing. But we’re going to show you five more of the, five of the runners-up.
I loved that one. If I could have vote, I would have voted for that.
Very close. On the submissions, they had to be the right length of time, they couldn’t use copyrighted music. A lot of them used music that you can’t just appropriate and run as a commercial. But I tell you, real talent. Oh, gees, I give you the wrong number on the number of votes. I give you last night’s number. Number of votes, 92, 000. 92,000.
92,000, and you have a lot of late night voters, obviously. What you see there in those ads, New York tough, smart, united, disciplined, loving. Mr. Sif.
You always have an annoying question Mr. Siff. One day, there will be a fun, upbeat, positive question.
That is not an annoying question. It is a repetitive question. The state set criteria that every region must meet. Their criteria doesn’t change. What is safe in Buffalo, is safe in New York, is safe in Suffolk. Those criteria don’t change. I don’t know what you’re talking about, threshold. Do you know? Does anybody-
Yeah. It’s simpler than that, right? You can go to the state dashboard. You can see the numbers. No local official can open or close, right? Suffolk County executive can’t open Suffolk. He can’t close Suffolk. He can’t open Suffolk schools. He can’t close Suffolk schools. We said deliberately, at the beginning of this, it’s going to be one standard that is data driven. There’s no politics here and safe is safe. What’s safe for your health in New York City… I’m not going to put your life at more risk or less risk than a life in Buffalo. I mean, it doesn’t work that way. There’s statewide criteria. They’re on the dashboard. There’s no changing the criteria. And it’s not up to the local officials. It’s a statewide decision across the board. Now, if you’re saying, well, look at particular circumstances in any locality. I mean, we could always do that, but that doesn’t change where we are now.
Look, if there’s a lack of coordination… well, I’m going to say the other way. If I have the ability to coordinate local policies, right, I have the ability to override local policies. The policy in the city of New York is that the beaches are closed. I understand that… I think the beaches in Nassau are open. The state beaches on Long Island are open. I think we have more of an operational issue, Zach. I think because the city beaches are closed, you’ll have more demand, not on the Nassau beaches, because they’re for Nassau residents only and Suffolk beaches are for Suffolk residents only, so you’ll have more demand on the state beaches, Jones Beach, Hither Hills, Robert Moses, Sunken Meadow, you could see an increased demand on those state beaches on Long Island, because they are open to New York City residents. Now, we have a 50% capacity for those beaches also, so they can do social distancing. But I understand the policy in New York City. I understand the Nassau policy and I understand the Suffolk policy. They can make sense for the locality, but still create a regional issue. And I think the regional issue people in New York City say, “I want to go to the beach.” We do have state beaches open precisely for that reason.
The local governments do not have any legal authority to open or reopen. They never have.
Nothing. What happens if you stand up and say, ” I think New York City should be open,” what happens? Nothing.
It would never happen. That would never happen. The mayor knows, first of all, the legality of the situation. And if you had a situation like that, we would talk.
What you guys tend to do is you juxtapose two different things. We have about 180 hospitals in downstate New York. Okay. Let’s say downstate, 200, just have a round number. Of the 200, H&amp;H, Health and Hospital Corporation has about, is it 11?
11, 12. 11? 11. Of those 11 are H&amp;H hospitals. H&amp;H, those 11 hospitals are run by the city of New York and the mayor. And he determines policy for those 11 hospitals. Elmhurst is one of those hospitals, et cetera. H&amp;H is 11 of 200 hospitals. H&amp;H and the policy of those hospitals is not a policy that covers all hospitals or all of New York City or all of downstate. It’s only those 11 hospitals. Whatever the policy in those 11 hospitals, those H&amp;H hospitals, that’s up to the city. They are city run hospitals. They are regulated by the state also, but they’re city run hospitals. But that is not a health policy that affects the 200 other hospitals or public health policy outside of those 11 hospitals. Do you know what I’m saying? The city often will make policy for those 11 hospitals that it’s reported… it sounds like it’s policy for all hospitals. That’s not true.
Yeah. The premise in your question is controversial. You stated a fact in your question. How many deaths are from COVID? That would suggest confirmed deaths from COVID are X. There’s a second category of probable deaths from COVID. They’re two different answers and they’re two different questions. Well just combine probable with confirmed. Some people say, “No. They’re not confirmed deaths. I asked how many deaths do you have from coronavirus?” Probable is different than confirmed. Probable is probable, but I have to check. I don’t know. I have to do further testing. We’ve had many cases that were probable coronavirus, turned out not to be coronavirus. That’s why they call them probable.
Your question says, “Well, just put them together.” Yeah, but there are a lot of scientists and experts who say don’t put them together because they’re two different categories, they’re two different answers. Confirmed deaths and probable deaths. Now some places just put them together. They then get criticized. You can’t put them together. They’re two different categories. So just state this number of confirmed, this number of probable. And then if you want to put them together, shorthand, that’s up to you. But scientifically they’re two different categories.
It’s how precise you want to be. People who want precision want them separate. I want confirmed deaths and then probable deaths, but they’re two different things.
Let’s take one more.
Yeah. It is the federal government’s obligation, as part of managing this national pandemic, that they provide financial relief to state and local governments just the way they took care of the big corporations, right? Are you saying the federal government should bail out airlines and hotels and big corporations, but nurses, doctors, police, officers, firefighters should lose their jobs? No, that’s unconscionable to me. Why don’t you pass legalization of marijuana? I support legalization of marijuana passage. I’ve worked very hard to pass it. I believe we will, but we didn’t get it done this last session because it’s a complicated issue and it has to be done in a comprehensive way.
Same thing.
Who says we’ve outsourced-
Is there anything left out, that I left out, doctor?
If there is blatant… Well, it’s not a fraud situation. Let me go back to my Attorney General days. They’re committing fraud. They’re not committing a fraud because the non eviction was not income specific, but the order said it had to be COVID related, right? And there might be a cause of action there. Let me look at the law and put on my Attorney General hat and I’ll get back to you on that. Thank you guys. Happy Memorial Day. I will see-
What about hydroxy?
The state is adopting the CDC guidance on hydroxychloroquine as state policy. So whatever the CDC said, the president’s CDC, is what we’re doing in New York. Thank you guys.
Thank you.
",Andrew Cuomo New York May 22 COVID-19 Press Conference Transcript,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/andrew-cuomo-new-york-may-22-covid-19-press-conference-transcript
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-10-22,"Oh, that is some crowd of people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's great to be back in Virginia Beach. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. And what a job Pat has done. Regent University, what a great place. Thank you very much. This is terrific. This is so amazing. In 17 days we are going to win the great Commonwealth of Virginia and we are going to win back the White House.
Early voting is underway so make sure you go and send your ballots. We've got to win this November 8th. We've got to win it. This is going to be our last chance, folks. I hate to tell you. This is about it. November 8th. One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the Evangelical community and the people of faith across our nation.
There are no more decent devoted and selfless people than our Christian brothers and sisters here in the United States. None. And I happen to be Presbyterian but that's good, that's good. Protestant. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. Earlier today I outlined my contract with the American voter.
The steps I will take my first 100 days in office and the bills I will send to Congress and these will be bills that will put us on the path of making this country great again, believe me. In fact I encourage you go visit our website and read it. you'll see a lot of good things and a lot of things that will make you very proud and very happy.
At the very top of the list is one of the most important promises of all: If I'm elected president, we are going to drain the swamp in Washington D.C. In the contract, I put forward a tough new ethics reform that will put the people back in charge of our government. We're going to renegotiate our terrible, and I mean terrible trade deals and illegal immigration stopped the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league, cut regulations even bigger league, unleash job producing American energy, cherish and defend faith and religious liberty.
And we are going to get rid of the Johnson Amendment. I hope you know what the Johnson Amendment is because it is a disaster for our great people and for our church. We will also repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. President Obama promised the American people that his plan would be affordable.
Instead, health insurance premiums are going through the roof and companies are being driven out of business, totally out of business. Many companies are being forced to flee the country. They're leaving our country. They're creating jobs in other countries instead. And now Hillary Clinton wants to double down and make Obamacare bigger and worse and much more expensive.
And it doesn't get any more expensive. Obamacare is now unaffordable and so unaffordable that even the Democrats are admitting it. Just this month, the Democratic governor of Minnesota said the reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. And Bill Clinton, who had a rough evening that evening, called Obamacare the craziest thing in the world.
He said that small businesses and middle class Americans are getting killed, and he was telling the truth. This election is our one chance to get rid of Obamacare and the cost of Obamacare. It doesn't work and it's too expensive. Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration.
Your taxes will go way way down under a Trump administration. And Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes your companies won't be leaving Virginia under a Trump administration. They'll be staying. We will be a strong nation again. We're going to rebuild our depleted military we have the greatest people on earth but our military is depleted with the equipment we're using and other things.
We are going to totally rebuild our military. We are going to start with the Navy, right here in Virginia Beach as part of our plan to create a 350 ship fleet. Little Creek and Naval Air Station Oceana are going to get a lot busier when I'm president. Get ready. How many people are from there? How many people do we have?
Well I saw a lot of people. Norfolk Naval Shipyard is too. Watch. They're going to get very busy, folks. Get ready. They're going to be right at the center of the action of the building of new ships. When it comes to the military, I believe in three very, very important words: Peace through strength. But we also need smart strategy.
WikiLeaks shows that John Podesta said of Hillary, ""She has bad instincts."" We knew that. Just look at her career. One of her close allies said, ""She doesn't seem to know what the planet and what planet we're living in."" Look at her record. She's been there for 30 years and what has she fixed. Nothing. She unleashes death, destruction, and failure in every country she touched in the Middle East, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran.
Hillary's catastrophic failures unleashed ISIS. Came right out of the vacuum which is now on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East and all over the world. I mean, think of what's happened. Think of what's going on. It started as a small group of people. And now ISIS is in 32 countries under her watch.
And now you hear that Hillary's going to do something about ISIS. That's not going to happen, folks. That's not going to happen at home. She failed on the economy and she failed in upstate New York. Right now, our economy isn't growing at all. We had only around 1% growth last quarter and a horrible jobs report on Thursday.
I'm going to get us to a 4% growth and maybe more than that and create 25 million jobs over a 10-year period. Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago working harder and longer and making less. And they're older but I'm working harder and longer and I'm older too so I don't feel sorry for you, OK. Some of them are working two and three jobs.
But still taking home less money for them and their families. Companies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small-car production divisions to Mexico. When I'm president if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico or other places then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their new products back into the United States.
And they won't be leaving very easily. Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs overseas and to other countries, you know that. With that money she's outspending our campaign in some ways by 50 to 1 in ads. We have markets where it's 50 to 1 and we're tied.
It's pretty good right. Our campaign is going and taking on these big donors. And interestingly polls just came out today where we're leading in three major polls leading nationwide. So that's good. Despite all of the Wall Street money that's being spent against us it's going to take on and we're going to take on the big donors.
We're going to take on big bonuses. And I'll tell you what the big business in this country. And I'm a part of it but I decided I'd been on the other side. You do know that right. I understand the other side. It's a very easy side to be on and I've been there a long time and I looked at and I said if I'm going to stay there I will tell you our country is in big trouble.
Our country is in trouble because it's the wrong thing. I love this country. I didn't need to do this. I love this country. And that's why I'm doing it. And we have a movement going. Like they've never had before. We have a movement going, folks, like they've never seen before in this country. Bet out and vote though, otherwise the movement comes to an end.
. This is a great, great movement. This is a movement, seriously, like they have never seen before in this country. We are driving them crazy. WikiLeaks even shows the Clinton campaign speaking with contempt about Catholics and evangelicals and then boasting gleefully about very friendly and malleable reporters who shower the Clintons with praise for no reason.
Our system is rigged. And I've been saying it for a long time and the best evidence is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for the presidency of the United States in the first place. She lied to the FBI and she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer.
Did anybody out there ever lose their phones with a hammer? Any -- Please raise your hand. Nobody. Well. You are a great group of people. By the way, we have two of our great generals, three of our great generals and we have right here, right here, General Kellogg, raise your hand. Fellas, raise your hand.
And we have a man that you've never heard of named Giuliani, the mayor of New York. Come on. Get over here, Rudy. Great guy. New York City was not doing well and it was crime infested. And after a year of Rudy it was starting to look good and after two years, boy, what a difference, and to this day what a difference he made.
He's something. Great job, Rudy. She bleached and deleted 33,000 emails and then two crucial boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing. You know we have a four-star general who has now got the potential to serve five years in prison and pay a massive fine. This was two days ago for doing something that was a tiny, tiny fraction of what took place with Hillary Clinton.
And it's a sad day for this country what's going on with her, with the FBI, with the Department of Justice. This is a sad time in the United States. Believe me and you all know it. A Trump administration will end government corruption. We will also end economic stagnation. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.
At the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals. Forty seven million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on food stamps. This is in our country, 45 million. We have nearly an eight-hundred-billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the World Trade and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.
We also have something else. The murder rate in the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. Virginia has lost one in three of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Clinton. A deal that was supported very strongly by Hillary. We've lost, listen to this number, 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization under the Bill-and-Hillary-backed deal.
We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. That's what it is. The greatest jobs theft. Our jobs are being taken out of our country and they're going to other countries all over the world. We don't make anything anymore on a relative basis. We're going to change that around.
We're going to start making things again. And it's going to happen fast. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating and stop the jobs from leaving our country. We're going to start making things in America. You're going to be so proud of it. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs we're going to lower our business tax from 35% to 15% and our businesses will start humming again.
We're also going to rebuild our inner cities for years and years and years. You've heard about this from the Democrats. They get the votes. They don't do a thing. African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.
There's no education. There's no jobs there's no safety. Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Think of that. Since January, 3,500 people have been shot. That's as bad as and worse than some of the war zones you're reading about in the Middle East. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore and it's getting worse.
To the African-American and Hispanic voters I say, ""What do you have to lose?"" Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it. It can't get worse. I will fix it. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be the country and to be a country of wealth we must also be a safe country. National security begins at the border.
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, her dream is for a totally open trade, there go your businesses, and open borders, there goes your country. You lose your businesses and your country. Anyone who supports open borders can never be the president of the United States. You will not have a country that.
Open borders would be the end of the United States, believe me as we know it. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes we will build a wall and we will stop drugs from pouring into our country.
And they're great people they want to do their job. They're not being allowed to do their job as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousand of thousands. I mean all of them, thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Think of it. It was just reported that a man deported from our country, 10 times in six years, has been charged with raping a 12 year old girl.
In August, Texas police arrest a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times. His victims included one 68-year old woman with a cane who took his offer to have a drive to her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road in horrible, horrible condition. A 64-year old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Perez was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant, who should have been deported under the Obama administration.
But never was. Should have been deported but never was. What kind of a government allows its citizen and it's citizens to suffer like this? And believe me, there is tremendous suffering going on. We have people from the remembrance project here and you just have to look at remembrance project these are amazing people.
These are amazing people, amazing people. So many, so many, and it's growing so fast and that's a bad thing. That's a bad thing. Either we win this election or we lose our country as we know it today. A victory in November will be a victory for you the American people. In closing, here are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We are going to have -- I love you too.
. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, even bigger. We'll eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We will defend religious liberty. We're going to provide school choice to every low-income child in America.
And we are going to end Common Core and bring education local. We will support the men and women of law enforcement. We're going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our wonderful, wonderful veterans who have not been properly taken care of. We're going to save the Second Amendment, which is under serious attack.
And we will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You have 17 days. That's all. You know I started this a year and a half ago it was on June 16th, in Trump Tower, coming down the escalator with Melania chest. I looked I saw downstairs I said, ""Wow, this is going to be -- this is going to be something."" Who knew this was going to happen, right?
Who knew/ We had 17 people running. We won. Now we have one left. Crooked Hillary Clinton. One, one. So you have 17 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your children, for your family, for your country to come to. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our citizens.
It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment. I'm going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom and every dad who lost her child or his child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence.
And it's happening all over. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of the states like Virginia and shipped to other countries. We're going to fight for your jobs and they have not done that for many, many years. I'm going to fight for every person in this country, who believes government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interest and I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag.
Because this will be the beginning. This is a movement like has never been seen before. You're going to look back at the election and you're going to remember November 8th because your country is going to be a country that starts winning again. We don't win anymore. When was the last time we don't win against ISIS.
We don't win against anything. Look at Mosul. For years I've heard that's where the ISIS leaders are. They're staying at Mosul. So what do we do? Instead of element of surprise. What do we do. What a disaster. What a disaster. We don't win anymore. We're not the smart people because of our leadership. We are going to start winning again bigger and better than ever before.
You're going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time because we started winning again and we started winning with heart. And remember the words religious liberty, that's a very big part of winning. That's a very, very impart of winning.
And our religious liberty is being trampled on and we can't let that happen. We can't let that happen. So you're going to look back. And you're going to be proud of your country again and hopefully you're going to be proud of your president because we will make America wealthy again. You hate to say that.
A woman came up to me said, ""Mr. Trump, it's not nice when you say you're going to make America wealthy or you're going to make America rich."" I said, ""I agree. But we have to do that in order to do what we have to do."" She said, ""But could you please refrain from saying it."" And she's a fan. I said, ""No we have to make America wealthy again."" I hate to say.
I'd like to say no but we have to. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. God bless you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Virginia Beach, VA",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-virginia-beach-va-october-22-2016
Barack Obama,United States of America,2012-01-05,"Good morning, everybody. The United States of America is the greatest force for freedom and security that the world has ever known. And in no small measure, that's because we've built the best-trained, best-led, best-equipped military in history -- and as Commander-in-Chief, I'm going to keep it that way.
Indeed, all of us on this stage -- every single one of us -- have a profound responsibility to every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coast Guardsman who puts their life on the line for America. We owe them a strategy with well-defined goals; to only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary; to give them the equipment and the support that they need to get the job done; and to care for them and their families when they come home. That is our solemn obligation.
And over the past three years, that's what we've done. We've continued to make historic investments in our military -- our troops and their capabilities, our military families and our veterans. And thanks to their extraordinary service, we've ended our war in Iraq. We've decimated al Qaeda's leadership. We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, and we've put that terrorist network on the path to defeat. We've made important progress in Afghanistan, and we've begun to transition so Afghans can assume more responsibility for their own security. We joined allies and partners to protect the Libyan people as they ended the regime of Muammar Qaddafi.
Now we're turning the page on a decade of war. Three years ago, we had some 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we've cut that number in half. And as the transition in Afghanistan continues, more of our troops will continue to come home. More broadly, around the globe we've strengthened alliances, forged new partnerships, and served as a force for universal rights and human dignity.
In short, we've succeeded in defending our nation, taking the fight to our enemies, reducing the number of Americans in harm's way, and we've restored America's global leadership. That makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that's an achievement that every American -- especially those Americans who are proud to wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces -- should take great pride in.
This success has brought our nation, once more, to a moment of transition. Even as our troops continue to fight in Afghanistan, the tide of war is receding. Even as our forces prevail in today's missions, we have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to look ahead to the force that we are going to need in the future.
At the same time, we have to renew our economic strength here at home, which is the foundation of our strength around the world. And that includes putting our fiscal house in order. To that end, the Budget Control Act passed by Congress last year -- with the support of Republicans and Democrats alike -- mandates reductions in federal spending, including defense spending. I've insisted that we do that responsibly. The security of our nation and the lives of our men and women in uniform depend on it.
That's why I called for this comprehensive defense review -- to clarify our strategic interests in a fast-changing world, and to guide our defense priorities and spending over the coming decade -- because the size and the structure of our military and defense budgets have to be driven by a strategy, not the other way around. Moreover, we have to remember the lessons of history. We can't afford to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past -- after World War II, after Vietnam -- when our military was left ill prepared for the future. As Commander in Chief, I will not let that happen again. Not on my watch.
We need a start -- we need a smart, strategic set of priorities. The new guidance that the Defense Department is releasing today does just that. I want to thank Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey for their extraordinary leadership during this process. I want to thank the service secretaries and chiefs, the combatant commanders and so many defense leaders -- military and civilian, active, Guard and reserve -- for their contributions. Many of us met repeatedly -- asking tough questions, challenging our own assumptions and making hard choices. And we've come together today around an approach that will keep our nation safe and our military the finest that the world have ever known.
This review also benefits from the contributions of leaders from across my national security team -- from the departments of State, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, as well as the intelligence community. And this is critical, because meeting the challenges of our time cannot be the work of our military alone -- or the United States alone. It requires all elements of our national power, working together in concert with our allies and our partners.
So I'm going to let Leon and Marty go into the details. But I just want to say that this effort reflects the guidance that I personally gave throughout this process. Yes, the tide of war is receding. But the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the last decade are over. And today, we're fortunate to be moving forward from a position of strength.
As I made clear in Australia, we will be strengthening our presence in the Asia Pacific, and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region. We're going to continue investing in our critical partnerships and alliances, including NATO, which has demonstrated time and again -- most recently in Libya -- that it's a force multiplier. We will stay vigilant, especially in the Middle East.
As we look beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the end of long-term nation-building with large military footprints -- we'll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces. We'll continue to get rid of outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities that we need for the future, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, counterterrorism, countering weapons of mass destruction and the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny us access.
So, yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats.
We're also going to keep faith with those who serve, by making sure our troops have the equipment and capabilities they need to succeed, and by prioritizing efforts that focus on wounded warriors, mental health and the well-being of our military families. And as our newest veterans rejoin civilian life, we'll keep working to give our veterans the care, the benefits and job opportunities that they deserve and that they have earned.
And with that, I will turn this discussion over to Leon and to Marty, who can explain more and take your questions.
So thank you very much. I understand this is the first time a President has done this. It's a pretty nice room.
Thank you guys.
",Address on Military Strategy Review,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamamilitarystrategychanges.htm
Michael Ancram,United Kingdom,2015-03-19,"This session has inevitably centred on Iraq. It has been a serious debate. Iain Duncan Smith set the scene for us. Bernard Jenkin and Caroline Spelman have enlarged upon it.
It has also rightly ranged wider.
We must never forget the war against international terrorism. The Chairman reminded us of the horrors of September 11 last year. We must continue to work with the international community to hunt down the terrorists and to ensure that they have nowhere to hide.
We welcome the recent arrests in Pakistan even if they are only the tip of the iceberg.
We have seen from recent alerts in Britain that the threat to us is real.
The first responsibility of government is the protection of its citizens. We will ensure that the Government does not take their eye off this ball.
Iraq however is the immediate priority. I make no excuse for returning to it again.
Of course we are concerned.
None of us want war. Some of us have spent significant parts of our lives working for peace. War must always be the last resort – when there is no better way of achieving what must be done.
That sad reality now stares us in the face. I still pray that Saddam Hussein will finally see that he has run out of road, and that even at this late date he will disarm.
His attitude has to change. If it does not, then the international community must act.
There are many questions and doubts. I take them very seriously. I believe the Government should have done much more to answer the questions and to meet the doubts from the outset.
They have not. So let me share with you our view.
Does Saddam really pose a risk to international peace and security?
The UN certainly thinks so – and has done so for the last 12 years.
All 17 resolutions passed against Iraq fall under Chapter VII of the UN Charter which specifically and exclusively deals with threats to international peace and security and in Article 42 specifically permits the use of military force if necessary to deal with it.. Indeed Resolution 1441 deliberately replicates the language of Article 42.
Nobody who signed up for it, including France, can be in any doubt as to what it means. They knew at the time they signed, and they still know it now.
So is that the threat a danger to us? There may be no obvious smoking gun yet. But I learned in Northern Ireland the value and importance of intelligence advice. They are our eyes where we cannot see and our ears where we cannot hear. They have told the PM that the threat is real, present and endangers us. We would be unwise to seek to second-guess them.
And even if the smoking gun is not there, there is certainly smoke is.
There is the further evidence produced in written form by Dr Hans Blix a week ago. It lists a blood-chilling number of unaccounted for weapons and biological and chemical stockpiles. Tonnes of anthrax and the nerve agent VX were present four years ago. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we can only assume that they are still there. Today’s Iraqi letter at first sight seems once again a propaganda device, too little and too late.
These weapons are simple to use either in Iraqi hands or in the hands of terrorists, particularly those who are careless of their own lives. They can be easily developed into even more lethal agents. They are easily transported and easily hidden.
These are the real risks and real threats we cannot ignore.
So why now?
There can never be an absolutely right time. But history teaches us that action delayed or postponed is rarely action avoided; that putting off what needs to be done almost always leads to worse challenges later on.
If we leave Saddam Hussein armed with WMD now, he will still have to be dealt with later when the risks will almost inevitably be much higher and the dangers infinitely greater.
I do not believe we have a right to pass this lethal buck on to those who will come after us. It would be contemptible, and as Conservatives must never tread that dishonourable path.
We support efforts to achieve a Second Resolution to implement Resolution 1441 within a given timetable. But a second resolution is not, and has never been, a legal prerequisite for military action.
We therefore will support whatever action – in conformity with international law – is necessary to remove Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction.
There is another aspect we should not ignore.
There are inevitably feelings of destabilisation throughout the Gulf. We should not underestimate how much of a running sore the unresolved problem of Israel/Palestine remains.
If we are to demonstrate that this is not a war against Islam we must support President Bush in his call for real progress on achieving two states west of the Jordan, a secure Israel and a viable Palestinian state, and the ending of settlement activity.
We must applaud his decision yesterday to publish the long-awaited ‘road-map’ to achieve this. We must add our weight, and press an ending of violence and a resumption of talks.
And as Caroline Spelman has said we must not lose sight of our obligations to help Iraq get back on its feet once this is all over.
We support the Prime Minister on Iraq. That support is not unconditional. Nor does it come easily. How politically tempting it would be to ride public opinion and oppose. It would also be dishonourable, irresponsible and wrong.
As have been the Liberal Democrats throughout this crisis, facing in all directions at the same time. Their behaviour has been despicable. It has even outdone their own usual low standards.
Hostile to Saddam at one moment, sympathetic at another. For the UN route last September, against the UN route in February, back in favour of it now. Against military action yesterday, apparently morally supporting it to day. What will his position be tomorrow?
He claims to have been consistent, when their only consistency has been their inconsistency. Kennedy makes the Grand Old Duke of York look like a paragon of decisiveness.
The Liberal Democrats are the ‘weather-vaners’, swinging with every shift of the popular wind.
Well we will not take that easy and dishonourable path. We will support Tony Blair on Iraq as long as he is acting in the national interest and is doing what is right.
But that is as far as we will support him.
Where he’s wrong as he has been on Gibraltar we will oppose him. We will stand by the people of Gibraltar and their rights to remain British. We will not betray them. And nor should the Prime Minister even for a moment think that he can trade Gibraltar’s sovereignty tomorrow for Spain’s support today
And then there is the government’s desertion of Zimbabwe. I cannot help feeling a profound sense of shame at how Britain under the lily-livered leadership of a government transfixed by its post-colonial guilt has abandoned that once great land.
Tony Blair told us that it was his moral duty to act in Zimbabwe. In practice he has done nothing.
On the cricket world cup he disgracefully tried to walk by on the other side. I hope he felt ashamed in the face of the courage of the Zimbabwean cricketers Andy Flower and Henry Olongo in their black arm-banded protest on the field against what is being done to their land. I salute those two brave cricketers.
Tony Blair may have abandoned the people of Zimbabwe in their hour of need. These two brave men did not. And nor shall we.
And we will oppose this Government on the future shape of Europe.
How many of us here are really aware of what is happening in Europe at this time?
How many of you know that the firm recommendations emanating from those charged with recommending the future shape of Europe are:
– a legal personality which is the first prerequisite of a European state,
– a fully fledged constitution complete with legally enforceable fundamental rights which is the second prerequisite,
– and the subjugation of our foreign and defence policy to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice which is the final prerequisite?
These together form a Rubicon between the original and acceptable concept of a Europe of Nations – the Europe we joined – and a European political union which ultimately will sound the death knell of our rights of self-determination.
I am horrified at the speed in which this Europe is being developed. Ministers who originally told us that they would resist such moves are now busy preparing the ground for a shameful volte-face and a despicable surrender.
Sadly Parliament with its overwhelming government majority can’t stop it. But it must be totally against the spirit of the unwritten British constitution that basic sovereignty can in this way be surrendered without the democratically expressed consent of the British people .
That is why I have demanded, and demand again today, a referendum before any treaty embodying such surrender is ratified.
Let me make this clear. We are not anti-Europe. We believe in a Europe built from the bottom up, with power flowing from the nation states – as was always originally intended.
We believe in a partnership of sovereign nations within which the single market is completed, where directives are framework rather than specific,
– where there is far greater parliamentary accountability over Euro-decisions, where we retain our own currency,
– where we cooperate on matters of mutual interest, but where we accept and indeed value our differences
And where we retain our basic rights of self-determination not least on Foreign policy and defence.
We must now go out and fight for this Europe as a genuine option.
Indeed when this current crisis is over there will be much restructuring to be done, much weakness to be repaired – on Europe, on Nato and on the UN. We will have a crucial role to play in all of these exercises. We must be ready.
And while Iraq inevitably preoccupies us, we must make sure that it does not allow this wretched government to get away with it on other international or European fronts.
And we will do so as part of that wider campaign to see this discredited bunch on their way.
New Labour has failed. Their much-vaunted pledges of standing up for Britain and their ethical foreign policy are now in tatters. They have not only failed domestically. They have failed in the international arena as well.
They are a derelict government, a government with no purpose. A government that should go.
I am sick and tired of living in a Britain that is being inexorably undermined by a Government that has lost its way.
I am sick and tired of a government that has lost all sense of national pride and which settles for the second rate.
I am sick and tired of a government that seeks to make us ashamed of our history, our traditions, our culture, our currency and our very Britishness.
As Conservatives we believe in Britain. We long for a country where people matter again, where values and standards once more count for something.
We want to be proud of our country without being called extremist, proud of our history without being labelled anachronistic.
We long for a country where freedom, nationally and internationally, means what it says rather than what political correctness tells us it means.
We are starting the march back to power.
We will need self-confidence. We will need self-belief. Above all we will need to work together as one, loyal to each other, and true to our leader Iain Duncan Smith.
We owe it to our country to send this rotten Government packing.
It is time for us to take them head on. The surrenderers in Europe, the betrayers of trust in Zimbabwe and of loyalty in Gibraltar. And the destroyers of national pride here at home. It is time they were gone.
Our resolution must be clear. To have strength, to have conviction, to have hope. To stand firm in defence of our national interests. And when this crisis is over, to go out and win.
",2003 Speech to Conservative Spring Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/michael-ancram-2003-speech-to-conservative-spring-conference/
Dominic Raab,United Kingdom,2020-04-07,"Good afternoon, welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and our Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty.
Before we get on to the detail, can I first give an update on the condition of the Prime Minister. I know a lot of people will be concerned about that.
I can tell you he is receiving the very best care from the excellent medical team at St Thomas’ hospital. He remained stable overnight, he’s receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance. He has not required mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support. He remains in good spirits and, in keeping with usual clinical practice, his progress continues to be monitored closely in critical care.
We will give further updates on the Prime Minister’s condition, when there are any material developments.
And I know that there’s been a groundswell of messages of support from people here at home, from leaders around the world and I know that everyone will want to join with me in wishing the Prime Minister a very swift recovery.
As you will know, the Prime Minister asked me to deputise for him whilst he recovers. In line with the Prime Minister’s instructions, this morning I chaired the meeting of senior ministers tackling coronavirus and this afternoon I chaired an update for members of the Cabinet.
And I think it’s probably worth just worth remembering that, as will be the case for so many people up and down the country, who knows someone at work at work who has fallen ill with coronavirus, it comes as a shock to all of us. He’s not just the Prime Minister, and for all of us in Cabinet he’s not just our boss, he’s also a colleague and he’s also our friend.
So, all of our thoughts and prayers are with the Prime Minister at this time, with Carrie and with his whole family.
And I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this Prime Minister, he’s a fighter and he’ll be back at the helm leading us through this crisis in short order. And for us in the Cabinet, we know exactly what he wants from us and what he expects from us right now.
And following the Cabinet discussion today, I can reassure the Prime Minister, and we can reassure the public, that his team will not blink, and we will not flinch from the task at hand at this crucial moment. We will keep all of our focus and all of our resolve, with calm determination on delivering the government’s plan to defeat the coronavirus.
And it’s with that objective and that unity of purpose, that Cabinet turned to business today.
We had reports from the 4 Ministerial Groups on the action we’re taking across all of the strategic priority areas: including NHS capacity, procurement of ventilators and personal protective equipment, then delivery of public services including social care, on the economy and our support for both businesses and workers, and of course on the international action we’re taking to reinforce our efforts on all of the home front.
As we’ve explained before, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that will help us protect the NHS’s ability to cope. At every step, we have been following the scientific advice, the medical advice, and we’ve been very deliberate in our actions that we’ve taken, so that we take the right steps at the right moment in time.
We are increasing our NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff, life-saving equipment on the front-line, so people have the care they need when they need it most. As we’ve consistently said, we are instructing people to stay at home, so we can protect the NHS and so that we can save lives.
So today I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme that, as of today:
213,181 people have now been tested for the coronavirus
55,242 people have tested positive
the number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 18,589
of those who have contracted the virus, 6,159 have, I am very sorry to say, died
Every death in this pandemic is a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones grieving at what must be an incredibly difficult time.
I think these figures reinforce that the single most important thing we can all do right now, in this national effort to defeat the virus, is to keep on following the government’s advice to:
",2020 Statement on the Coronavirus,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/dominic-raab-2020-statement-on-the-coronavirus-3/
Gordon Brown,United Kingdom,2015-11-07,"Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, distinguished members of Congress, I come to this great capital of this great nation, an America renewed under a new President to say that America’s faith in the future has been, is and always will be an inspiration to the whole world.
The very creation of America was a bold affirmation of faith in the future: a future you have not just believed in but built with your own hands.
And on January 20th, you the American people began to write the latest chapter in the American story, with a transition of dignity, in which both sides of the aisle could take great pride. President Obama gave the world renewed hope, and on that day billions of people truly looked to Washington D.C as “a shining city upon a hill”.
And I hope that you will allow me to single out for special mention today one of your most distinguished Senators, known in every continent and a great friend. Northern Ireland is today at peace, more Americans have health care, more children around the world are going to school, and for all those things we owe a great debt to the life and courage of, Senator Edward Kennedy.
And so today, having talked to him last night, I want to announce that Her Majesty The Queen, has awarded an honorary Knighthood for Sir Edward Kennedy.
Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, I come in friendship to renew, for new times, our special relationship founded upon our shared history, our shared values and, I believe, our shared futures.
I grew up in the 1960s as America, led by President Kennedy, looked to the heavens and saw not the endless void of the unknown, but a new frontier to dare to discover and explore. People said it couldn’t be done – but America did it.
And 20 years later, in the 1980’s, America led by President Reagan refused to accept the fate of millions trapped behind an Iron Curtain, and insisted instead that the people of Eastern Europe be allowed to join the ranks of nations which live safe, strong and free. People said it would never happen in our lifetime but it did, and the Berlin Wall was torn down brick by brick.
So early in my life I came to understand that America is not just the indispensible nation, it is the irrepressible nation.
Throughout your history Americans have led insurrections in the human imagination, have summoned revolutionary times through your belief that there is no such thing as an impossible endeavour. It is never possible to come here without having your faith in the future renewed.
Throughout a whole century the American people stood liberty’s ground not just in one world war but in two.
And I want you to know that we will never forget the sacrifice and service of the American soldiers who gave their lives for people whose names they never knew, and whose faces they never saw, and yet people who have lived in freedom thanks to the bravery and valour of the Americans who gave the “last full measure of devotion”.
Cemetery after cemetery across Europe honours the memory of American soldiers, resting row upon row – often alongside comrades-in-arms from Britain. There is no battlefield of liberty on which there is not a piece of land that is marked out as American and there is no day of remembrance in Britain that is not also a commemoration of American courage and sacrifice far from home.
In the hardest days of the last century, faith in the future kept America alive and I tell you that America kept faith in the future alive for all the world.
Almost every family in Britain has a tie that binds them to America. So I want you to know that whenever a young American soldier or marine, sailor or airman is killed in conflict anywhere in the world, we, the people of Britain, grieve with you. Know that your loss is our loss; your families’ sorrow is our families’ sorrow and your nation’s determination is our nation’s determination that they shall not have died in vain.
And let me pay tribute to the soldiers, yours and ours, who again fight side by side in the plains of Afghanistan and the streets of Iraq, just as their forefathers fought side by side in the sands of Tunisia, on the beaches of Normandy and then on the bridges over the Rhine.
And after that terrible September morning when your homeland was attacked, the Coldstream Guards at Buckingham Palace played the Star Spangled Banner. Our own British tribute as we wept for our friends in the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And let me promise you our continued support to ensure there is no hiding place for terrorists, no safe haven for terrorism. You should be proud that in the hard years since 2001 you have shown that while terrorists may destroy buildings and even, tragically, lives, they have not, and will not ever, destroy the American spirit.
So let it be said of the friendship between our two countries; that it is in times of trial – true, in the face of fear – faithful and amidst the storms of change – constant.
And let it be said of our friendship – formed and forged over two tumultuous centuries, a friendship tested in war and strengthened in peace – that it has not just endured but is renewed in each generation to better serve our shared values and fulfil the hopes and dreams of the day. Not an alliance of convenience, but a partnership of purpose.
Alliances can wither or be destroyed, but partnerships of purpose are indestructible. Friendships can be shaken, but our friendship is unshakeable. Treaties can be broken but our partnership is unbreakable. And I know there is no power on earth than can drive us apart.
We will work tirelessly with you as partners for peace in the Middle East: for a two state solution that provides for nothing less than a secure Israel safe within its borders existing side by side with a viable Palestinian state.
And our shared message to Iran is simple – we are ready for you to rejoin the world community. But first, you must cease your threats and suspend your nuclear programme. And we will work tirelessly with all those in the international community who are ready to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation.
Past British Prime Ministers have travelled to this Capitol building in times of war to talk of war. I come now to talk of new and different battles we must fight together; to speak of a global economy in crisis and a planet imperilled.
These are new priorities for our new times.
And let us be honest – tonight too many parents, after they put their children to bed, will speak of their worries about losing their jobs or the need to sell the house. Too many will share stories of friends or neighbours already packing up their homes, and too many will talk of a local store or business that has already gone to the wall.
For me, this global recession is not to be measured just in statistics, or in graphs or in figures on a balance sheet. Instead I see one individual with their own aspirations and increasingly their own apprehensions, and then another, and then another.
Each with their own stars to reach for.
Each part of a family, each at the heart of a community now in need of help and hope.
And when banks have failed and markets have faltered, we the representatives of the people have to be the people’s last line of defence.
And that’s why there is no financial orthodoxy so entrenched, no conventional thinking so engrained, no special interest so strong that it should ever stand in the way of the change that hard-working families need.
We have learned through this world downturn that markets should be free but never values-free, that the risks people take should never be separated from the responsibilities they meet.
And if perhaps some once thought it beyond our power to shape global markets to meet the needs of people, we know now that is our duty; we cannot and must not stand aside.
In our families and workplaces and places of worship, we celebrate men and women of integrity who work hard, treat people fairly, take responsibility and look out for others.
If these are the principles we live by in our families and neighbourhoods, they should also be the principles that guide and govern our economic life too.
In these days the world has learned that what makes for the good economy makes for the good society.
My father was a Minister of the church and I have learned again what I was taught by him: that wealth must help more than the wealthy, good fortune must serve more than the fortunate and riches must enrich not just some of us but all.
And these enduring values are the values we need for these new times.
We tend to think of the sweep of destiny as stretching across many months and years before culminating in decisive moments we call history.
But sometimes the reality is that defining moments of history come suddenly and without warning. And the task of leadership then is to define them, shape them and move forward into the new world they demand.
An economic hurricane has swept the world, creating a crisis of credit and of confidence.
History has brought us now to a point where change is essential. We are summoned not just to manage our times but to transform them.
Our task is to rebuild prosperity and security in a wholly different economic world, where competition is no longer local but global and banks are no longer just national but international.
And we need to understand what went wrong in this crisis, that the very financial instruments that were designed to diversify risk across the banking system instead spread contagion across the globe. And today’s financial institutions are so interwoven that a bad bank anywhere is a threat to good banks everywhere.
So should we succumb to a race to the bottom and a protectionism that history tells us that, in the end, protects no-one? No. We should have the confidence that we can seize the opportunities ahead and make the future work for us.
Why?
Because while today people are anxious and feel insecure, over the next two decades literally billions of people in other continents will move from being simply producers of their goods to being consumers of our goods and in this way our world economy will double in size.
Twice as many opportunities for business, twice as much prosperity, and the biggest expansion of middle class incomes and jobs the world has ever seen.
And America and Britain will succeed and lead if we tap into the talents of our people, unleash the genius of our scientists and set free the drive of our entrepreneurs. We will win the race to the top if we can develop the new high value products and services and the new green technologies that the rising numbers of hard-working families across our globe will want to buy.
So we must educate our way out of the downturn, invest and invent our way out of the downturn and re-tool and re-skill our way out of the downturn.
And this is not blind optimism or synthetic confidence to console people; it is the practical affirmation for our times of our faith in a better future.
Every time we rebuild a school we demonstrate our faith in the future. Every time we send more young people to university, every time we invest more in our new digital infrastructure, every time we increase support to our scientists, we demonstrate our faith in the future.
And so I say to this Congress and this country, something that runs deep in your character and is woven in your history, we conquer our fear of the future through our faith in the future.
And it is this faith in the future that means we must commit to protecting the planet for generations that will come long after us.
As the Greek proverb says, why does anybody plant the seeds of a tree whose shade they will never see?
The answer is because they look to the future.
And I believe that you, the nation that had the vision to put a man on the moon, are also the nation with the vision to protect and preserve our planet earth.
And it is only by investing in environmental technology that we can end the dictatorship of oil, and it is only by tackling climate change that we create the millions of new green jobs we need.
For the lesson of this crisis is that we cannot just wait for tomorrow today. We cannot just think of tomorrow today. We cannot merely plan for tomorrow today. Our task must be to build tomorrow today.
And America knows from its history that its reach goes far beyond its geography. For a century you have carried upon your shoulders the greatest of responsibilities: to work with and for the rest of the world. And let me tell you that now more than ever the rest of the world wants to work with you.
And if these times have shown us anything it is that the major challenges we all face are global. No matter where it starts, an economic crisis does not stop at the water’s edge. It ripples across the world. Climate change does not honour passport control. Terrorism has no respect for borders. And modern communications instantly span every continent. The new frontier is that there is no frontier, the new shared truth is that global problems need global solutions.
And let me say that you now have the most pro-American European leadership in living memory. A leadership that wants to cooperate more closely together, in order to cooperate more closely with you. There is no old Europe, no new Europe, there is only your friend Europe.
So once again I say we should seize the moment – because never before have I seen a world so willing to come together. Never before has that been more needed. And never before have the benefits of cooperation been so far-reaching.
So when people here and in other countries ask what more can we do now to bring an end to this downturn, let me say this: we can achieve more working together. And just think of what we can do if we combine not just in a partnership for security but in a new partnership for prosperity too.
On jobs, you the American people through your stimulus proposals could create or save at least 3 million jobs. We in Britain are acting with similar determination. How much nearer an end to this downturn would we be if the whole of the world resolved to do the same?
And you are also restructuring your banks. So are we. But how much safer would everybody’s savings be if the whole world finally came together to outlaw shadow banking systems and offshore tax havens?
Just think how each of our actions, if combined, could mean a whole, much greater than the sum of the parts
– all and not just some banks stabilised
– on fiscal stimulus: the impact multiplied because everybody does it
– rising demand in all our countries creating jobs in each of our countries
– and trade once again the engine of prosperity, the wealth of nations restored.
No one should forget that it was American visionaries who over half a century ago, coming out of the deepest of depressions and the worst of wars, produced the boldest of plans for global economic cooperation because they recognised prosperity was indivisible and concluded that to be sustained it had to be shared.
And I believe that ours too is a time for renewal, for a plan for tackling recession and building for the future. Every continent playing their part in a global new deal, a plan for prosperity that can benefit us all.
First, so that the whole of the worldwide banking system serves our prosperity rather than risks it, let us agree rules and standards for accountability, transparency, and reward that will mean an end to the excesses and will apply to every bank, everywhere, and all the time.
Second, America and a few countries cannot be expected to bear the burden of the fiscal and interest rate stimulus alone. We must share it globally. So let us work together for the worldwide reduction of interest rates and a scale of stimulus round the world equal to the depth of the recession and the dimensions of the recovery we must make.
Third, let us together renew our international economic cooperation, helping the emerging markets rebuild their banks. And let us work together for a low carbon recovery worldwide. And I am confident that this President, this Congress and the peoples of the world can come together in Copenhagen this December to reach a historic agreement on climate change.
And let us not forget the poorest. As we strive to spread the values of peace, political liberty, and the hope for better lives across the world, perhaps the greatest gift our generation could give to the future, the gift of America and Britain to the world could be, for every child in every country of the world, the chance millions do not have today; the chance to go to school.
For let us remember there is a common bond that unites us as human beings across different beliefs, cultures and nationalities. It is at the core of my convictions, the essence of America’s spirit and the heart of all faiths.
And it must be at the centre of our response to the crisis of today. At their best, our values tell us that we cannot be wholly content while others go without, cannot be fully comfortable while millions go without comfort, cannot be truly happy while others grieve alone.
And this too is true. All of us know that in a recession the wealthiest, the most powerful and the most privileged can find a way through for themselves.
So we do not value the wealthy less when we say that our first duty is to help the not so wealthy. We do not value the powerful less when we say that our first responsibility is to help the powerless. And we do not value those who are secure less when we say that our first priority must be to help the insecure.
These recent events have forced us all to think anew. And while I have learnt many things, I keep returning to something I first learned in my father’s church as a child. In this most modern of crises I am drawn to the most ancient of truths; wherever there is hardship, wherever there is suffering, we cannot, we will not, pass by on the other side.
But working together there is no challenge to which we are not equal, no obstacle that we cannot overcome, no aspiration so high that it cannot be achieved.
In the depths of the Depression, when Franklin Roosevelt did battle with fear itself, it was not simply by the power of his words, his personality and his example that he triumphed.
Yes, all these things mattered. But what mattered more was this enduring truth: that you, the American people, at your core, were, as you remain, every bit as optimistic as your Roosevelts, your Reagans and your Obamas.
This is the faith in the future that has always been the story and promise of America. So at this defining moment in history let us renew our special relationship for our generation and our times. Let us restore prosperity and protect this planet and, with faith in the future, let us together build tomorrow today.

Warren G. Harding,United States of America,1920-08-28 00:00:00,"I greet you in a spirit of rejoicing. Not a rejoicing in the narrow partisan or personal sense, not in the gratifying prospect of party triumph, but I rejoice that America is still free and independent and in a position of self-reliance, opposed to the right of self-determination.
Let us take stock for a moment of America in the world, aye, and of America at home. The end of the war found our unselfishness emphasized to all mankind. The garlands of world leadership were bestowed from every direction. We had only to follow the path of America, rejoicing in the inheritance which led to our eminence, to rivet the gaze of all peoples upon our standards of national righteousness and our conception of international justice. 
Moreover, the world was ready to give us its confidence. It was the beckoning opportunity of the century, not for the glorification of this New World republic, but for America to hold every outpost of advancing civilization and invite all nations to join the further advance to heights dreamed of, but never before approached.
But force of example was slung aside for force of armed alliance. We neglected our restorations at home, and the sacrifice of millions of lives left us and the world groping in anxiety, instead of revealing us in the sunlight of a new day with lines formed, ready for the onward march of peace and all its triumphs. Mindful of our splendid examples, and renewing every obligation of association in war, I want America to be the rock of security at home, resolute in righteousness and supremacy of the law. Our moral leadership in the world was lost when ambition sought to superimpose a reactionary theory of discredited autocracy upon the progressive principle of living, glowing democracy.
My deep aspiration, my countrymen, if clothed with power, will be to regain that lost leadership, not for myself, not even for my party, though honoring and trusting it as I do, but for the country that I love from the bottom of my heart, with every fiber of my being, above all else in the world.

Grover Cleveland,United States of America,1894-03-29 00:00:00,"House of Representatives:
I return without my approval House bill No. 4956, entitled ""An act directing the coinage of the silver bullion held in the Treasury, and for other purposes.''
My strong desire to avoid disagreement with those in both Houses of Congress who have supported this bill would lead me to approve it if I could believe that the public good would not be thereby endangered and that such action on my part would be a proper discharge of official duty. Inasmuch, however, as I am unable to satisfy myself that the proposed legislation is either wise or opportune, my conception of the obligations and responsibilities attached to the great office I hold forbids the indulgence of my personal desire and inexorably confines me to that course which is dictated by my reason and judgment and pointed out by a sincere purpose to protect and promote the general interests of our people.
The financial disturbance which swept over the country during the last year was unparalleled in its severity and disastrous consequences. There seemed to be almost an entire displacement of faith in our financial ability and a loss of confidence in our fiscal policy. Among those who attempted to assign causes for our distress it was very generally conceded that the operation of a provision of law then in force which required the Government to purchase monthly a large amount of silver bullion and issue its notes in payment therefor was either entirely or to a large extent responsible for our condition. This led to the repeal on the 1st day of November, 1893, of this statutory provision.
We had, however, fallen so low in the depths of depression and timidity and apprehension had so completely gained control in financial circles that our rapid recuperation could not be reasonably expected. Our recovery has, nevertheless, steadily progressed, and though less than five months have elapsed since the repeal of the mischievous silver-purchase requirement a wholesome improvement is unmistakably apparent. Confidence in our absolute solvency is to such an extent reinstated and faith in our disposition to adhere to sound financial methods is so far restored as to produce the most encouraging results both at home and abroad. The wheels of domestic industry have been slowly set in motion and the tide of foreign investment has again started in our direction.
Our recovery being so well under way, nothing should be done to check our convalescence; nor should we forget that a relapse at this time would almost surely reduce us to a lower stage of financial distress than that from which we are just emerging.
I believe that if the bill under consideration should become a law it would be regarded as a retrogression from the financial intentions indicated by our recent repeal of the provision forcing silver-bullion purchases; that it would weaken, if it did not destroy, returning faith and confidence in our sound financial tendencies, and that as a consequence our progress to renewed business health would be unfortunately checked and a return to our recent distressing plight seriously threatened.
This proposed legislation is so related to the currency conditions growing out of the law compelling the purchase of silver by the Government that a glance at such conditions and a partial review of the law referred to may not be unprofitable.
Between the 14th day of August, 1890, when the law became operative, and the 1st day of November, 1893, when the clause it contained directing the purchase of silver was repealed, there were purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury more than 168,000,000 ounces of silver bullion. In payment for this bullion the Government issued its Treasury notes, of various denominations, amounting to nearly $156,000,000, which notes were immediately added to the currency in circulation among our people. Such notes were by the law made legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, except when otherwise expressly stipulated, and were made receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues, and when so received might be reissued. They were also permitted to be held by banking associations as a part of their lawful reserves.
On the demand of the holders these Treasury notes were to be redeemed in gold or silver coin, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury; but it was declared as a part of this redemption provision that it was ""the established policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be provided by law."" The money coined from such bullion was to be standard silver dollars, and after directing the immediate coinage of a little less than 28,000,000 ounces the law provided that as much of the remaining bullion should be thereafter coined as might be necessary to provide for the redemption of the Treasury notes issued on its purchase, and that ""any gain or seigniorage arising from such coinage shall be accounted for and paid into the Treasury.""
This gain or seigniorage evidently indicates so much of the bullion owned by the Government as should remain after using a sufficient amount to coin as many standard silver dollars as should equal in number the dollars represented by the Treasury notes issued in payment of the entire quantity of bullion. These Treasury notes now outstanding and in circulation amount to $152,951,280, and although there has been thus far but a comparatively small amount of this bullion coined, yet the so-called gain or seigniorage, as above defined, which would arise from the coinage of the entire mass has been easily ascertained to be a quantity of bullion sufficient to make when coined 55,156,681 standard silver dollars.
Considering the present intrinsic relation between gold and silver, the maintenance of the parity between the two metals, as mentioned in this law, can mean nothing less than the maintenance of such a parity in the estimation and confidence of the people who use our money in their daily transactions. Manifestly the maintenance of this parity can only be accomplished, so far as it is affected by these Treasury notes and in the estimation of the holders of the same, by giving to such holders on their redemption the coin, whether it is gold or silver, which they prefer. It follows that while in terms the law leaves the choice of coin to be paid on such redemption to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, the exercise of this discretion, if opposed to the demands of the holder, is entirely inconsistent with the effective and beneficial maintenance of the parity between the two metals.
If both gold and silver are to serve us as money and if they together are to supply to our people a safe and stable currency, the necessity of preserving this parity is obvious. Such necessity has been repeatedly conceded in the platforms of both political parties and in our Federal statutes. It is nowhere more emphatically recognized than in the recent law which repealed the provision under which the bullion now on hand was purchased. This law insists upon the ""maintenance of the parity in value of the coins of the two metals and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the markets and in the payment of debts.""
The Secretary of the Treasury has therefore, for the best of reasons, not only promptly complied with every demand for the redemption of these Treasury notes in gold, but the present situation as well as the letter and spirit of the law appear plainly to justify, if they do not enjoin upon him, a continuation of such redemption.
The conditions I have endeavored to present may be thus summarized: First. The Government has purchased and now has on hand sufficient silver bullion to permit the coinage of all the silver dollars necessary to redeem in such dollars the Treasury notes issued for the purchase of said silver bullion, and enough besides to coin, as gain or seigniorage, 55,156,681 additional standard silver dollars.
Second. There are outstanding and now in circulation Treasury notes issued in payment of the bullion purchased amounting to $152,951,280. These notes are legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, except when otherwise expressly stipulated; they are receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues; when held by banking associations they may be counted as part of their lawful reserves, and they are redeemed by the Government in gold at the option of the holders. These advantageous attributes were deliberately attached to these notes at the time of their issue. They are fully understood by our people to whom such notes have been distributed as currency, and have inspired confidence in their safety and value, and have undoubtedly thus induced their continued and contented use as money, instead of anxiety for their redemption.
Having referred to some incidents which I deem relevant to the subject, it remains for me to submit a specific statement of my objections to the bill now under consideration.
This bill consists of two sections, excluding one which merely appropriates a sum sufficient to carry the act into effect. The first section provides for the immediate coinage of the silver bullion in the Treasury which represents the so-called gain or seigniorage, or which would arise from the coinage of all the bullion on hand, which gain or seigniorage this section declares to be $55,156,681. It directs that the money so coined or the certificates issued thereon shall be used in the payment of public expenditures, and provides that if the needs of the Treasury demand it the Secretary of the Treasury may, in his discretion, issue silver certificates in excess of such coinage, not exceeding the amount of seigniorage in said section authorized to be coined.
The second section directs that as soon as possible after the coinage of this seigniorage the remainder of the bullion held by the Government shall be coined into legal-tender standard silver dollars, and that they shall be held in the Treasury for the redemption of the Treasury notes issued in the purchase of said bullion. It provides that as fast as the bullion shall be coined for the redemption of said notes they shall not be reissued, but shall be canceled and destroyed in amounts equal to the coin held at any time in the Treasury derived from the coinage provided for, and that silver certificates shall be issued on such coin in the manner now provided by law. It is, however, especially declared in said section that the act shall not be construed to change existing laws relating to the legal-tender character or mode of redemption of the Treasury notes issued for the purchase of the silver bullion to be coined.
The entire bill is most unfortunately constructed. Nearly every sentence presents uncertainty and invites controversy as to its meaning and intent. The first section is especially faulty in this respect, and it is extremely doubtful whether its language will permit the consummation of its supposed purposes. I am led to believe that the promoters of the bill intended in this section to provide for the coinage of the bullion constituting the gain or seigniorage, as it is called, into standard silver dollars, and yet there is positively nothing in the section to prevent its coinage into any description of silver coins now authorized under any existing law.
I suppose this section was also intended, in case the needs of the Treasury called for money faster than the seigniorage bullion could actually be coined, to permit the issue of silver certificates in advance of such coinage; but its language would seem to permit the issuance of such certificates to double the amount of seigniorage as stated, one-half of which would not represent an ounce of silver in the Treasury. The debate upon this section in the Congress developed an earnest and positive difference of opinion as to its object and meaning. In any event, I am clear that the present perplexities and embarrassments of the Secretary of the Treasury ought not to be augmented by devolving upon him the execution of a law so uncertain and confused.
I am not willing, however, to rest my objection to this section solely on these grounds. In my judgment sound finance does not commend a further infusion of silver into our currency at this time unaccompanied by further adequate provision for the maintenance in our Treasury of a safe gold reserve.
Doubts also arise as to the meaning and construction of the second section of the bill. If the silver dollars therein directed to be coined are, as the section provides, to be held in the Treasury for the redemption of Treasury notes, it is suggested that, strictly speaking, certificates can not be issued on such coin ""in the manner now provided by law,"" because these dollars are money held in the Treasury for the express purpose of redeeming Treasury notes on demand, which would ordinarily mean that they were set apart for the purpose of substituting them for these Treasury notes. They are not, therefore, held in such a way as to furnish a basis for certificates according to any provision of existing law.
If however, silver certificates can properly be issued upon these dollars, there is nothing in the section to indicate the characteristics and functions of these certificates. If they were to be of the same character as silver certificates in circulation under existing laws, they would at best be receivable only for customs, taxes, and all public dues; and under the language of this section it is, to say the least, extremely doubtful whether the certificates it contemplates would be lawfully received even for such purposes.
Whatever else may be said of the uncertainties of expression in this bill, they certainly ought not to be found in legislation affecting subjects so important and far-reaching as our finances and currency. In stating other and more important reasons for my disapproval of this section I shall, however, assume that under its provisions the Treasury notes issued in payment for silver bullion will continue to be redeemed as heretofore, in silver or gold, at the option of the holders, and that if when they are presented for redemption or reach the Treasury in any other manner there are in the Treasury coined silver dollars equal in nominal value to such Treasury notes, then and in that case the notes will be destroyed and silver certificates to an equal amount be substituted.
I am convinced that this scheme is ill advised and dangerous. As an ultimate result of its operation Treasury notes, which are legal tender for all debts, public and private, and which are redeemable in gold or silver at the option of the holder, will be replaced by silver certificates, which, whatever may be their character and description, will have none of these qualities. In anticipation of this result and as an immediate effect the Treasury notes will naturally appreciate in value and desirability. The fact that gold can be realized upon them and the further fact that their destruction has been decreed when they reach the Treasury must tend to their withdrawal from general circulation to be immediately presented for gold redemption or to be hoarded for presentation at a more convenient season. The sequel of both operations will be a large addition to the silver currency in our circulation and a corresponding reduction of gold in the Treasury. The argument has been made that these things will not occur at once, because a long time must elapse before the coinage of anything but the seigniorage can be entered upon. If the physical effects of the execution of the second section of this bill are not to be realized until far in the future, this may furnish a strong reason why it should not be passed so much in advance; but the postponement of its actual operation can not prevent the fear and loss of confidence and nervous precaution which would immediately follow its passage and bring about its worst consequences. I regard this section of the bill as embodying a plan by which the Government will be obliged to pay out its scanty store of gold for no other purpose than to force an unnatural addition of silver money into the hands of our people. This is an exact reversal of the policy which safe finance dictates if we are to preserve parity between gold and silver and maintain sensible bimetallism.
We have now outstanding more than $338,000,000 in silver certificates issued under existing laws. They are serving the purpose of money usefully and without question. Our gold reserve, amounting to only a little more than $100,000,000, is directly charged with the redemption of $346,000,000 of United States notes. When it is proposed to inflate our silver currency it is a time for strengthening our gold reserve instead of depleting it. I can not conceive of a longer step toward silver monometallism than we take when we spend our gold to buy silver certificates for circulation, especially in view of the practical difficulties surrounding the replenishment of our gold.
This leads me to earnestly present the desirability of granting to the Secretary of the Treasury a better power than now exists to issue bonds to protect our gold reserve when for any reason it should be necessary. Our currency is in such a confused condition and our financial affairs are apt to assume at any time so critical a position that it seems to me such a course is dictated by ordinary prudence.
I am not insensible to the arguments in favor of coining the bullion seigniorage now in the Treasury, and I believe it could be done safely and with advantage if the Secretary of the Treasury had the power to issue bonds at a low rate of interest under authority in substitution of that now existing and better suited to the protection of the Treasury.
I hope a way will present itself in the near future for the adjustment of our monetary affairs in such a comprehensive and conservative manner as will accord to silver its proper place in our currency; but in the meantime I am extremely solicitous that whatever action we take on this subject may be such as to prevent loss and discouragement to our people at home and the destruction of confidence in our financial management abroad.

David Lidington,United Kingdom,2018-10-25,"Well thank you very much indeed for the invitation to open trading today and to mark this, the first, the inaugural, and I’m sure by no means the only or the last, London Stock Exchange Group’s cyber security conference.
We’ve got every reason in this country to be proud of the United Kingdom’s position at the front of the global digital revolution – driving our prosperity and enhancing our national security. We have seen a rise in the number of new cyber technology companies, right across the UK, who are helping to keep some of our biggest enterprises secure.
But of course, with that opportunity comes risk. We’ve also seen a significant increase in malicious cyber activity globally – both from hostile nation states and from cyber criminals. And only last week The National Cyber Security Centre reported that it is defending the United Kingdom from around 10 significant cyber attacks every week.
And that’s why cyber security remains a top priority for the government and why, two years ago, we launched the National Cyber Security Strategy.
At the very heart of the government’s response was the creation of the National Cyber Security Centre, bringing together the best intelligence and expertise. Right here in the City, the NCSC’s valuable partnership with the Bank of England and its suppliers is helping to build cyber security into the heart of a number of next generation systems. And I am delighted to announce this morning, that Faster Payments – now called Pay.UK – will be the latest scheme to benefit from this collaboration. It will ensure that every payment processed in the United Kingdom is done so safely and securely.
The financial sector has, for a long time, recognised the cyber risk posed by criminals and by states, and I know that financial companies routinely considers cyber security as part of an overall approach to business risk.
In fact, we in government have taken best practice from the financial sector. We’ve launched the GBEST scheme, for government, based upon the sector’s CBEST model. And this will improve government systems to identify and to act against sophisticated and persistent cyber attacks.
And I think the finance sector in the UK should be commended for the initiatives they have taken and the standards they have set.
But the government’s latest Cyber Security Breaches survey showed a significant proportion of companies overall in our economy are still not adopting the basic cyber security precautions that are needed. More than two in five businesses identified breaches in the last twelve months. Despite that, two thirds of FTSE 350 boards say that they have had no training in how to deal with a cyber incident.
There is still a lot more to do – and our ability to build the necessary resilience in the face of these challenges, relies on the strength of our collective action and expertise.
Now last week, I really enjoyed being at UK Finance, and it gave me great pleasure to give the government’s full backing to a new initiative to further cement the growing partnership between industry and the public sector. Early next year, we will establish the Finance Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre. This will build on existing industry expertise and exploit the NCSC’s Industry 100 scheme, it will be led by UK Finance in alliance with 20 financial institutions.
As government, we recognise that cyber security is everyone’s responsibility. We must learn from – and support – one another. For example…
…By taking part in our annual FTSE 350 Cyber Governance Health check – which is now open – you can benchmark the cyber security of your organisation against your peers and understand where you can improve your resilience to cyber attacks.
And I believe our efforts are bearing fruit. The UK’s cyber security industry is making an enormous contribution and is generating more than £5 billion to our economy.
It benefits from strong support from government, including specialist expertise and world leading academic institutions which are providing much needed access to funding, targeted support and also testing facilities. There has never been a better time to invest in our high-quality and home-grown cyber security start-ups and emerging businesses – there are now more than 800 of those across the UK.
Those businesses, supported by the government’s Industrial Strategy, provide world leading products and services to buyers right across the world – injecting innovation into our economy to build a UK fit for the future.
We consider it vital that all organisations should embrace and embed cyber security, from the boardroom down. This isn’t only about minimising operational, financial and reputational risk. Building resilience amongst employees and customers can also be a catalyst for far greater change.
That’s why I will be meeting a number of FTSE 350 Chairman to discuss how the government’s new Board Toolkit will help you better understand cyber risks and also to seek the ideas of business leaders on how to make our nation more resilient.
So, to look ahead to the challenges and opportunities of the future, I look forward to continuing to work together with you in the financial sector, and business more widely, to protect both our national security and our joint economic prosperity.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-05-09,"Okay, thank you very much. We have a lot of things happening, as you know. But last night was a very big night for the Republican Party. Every candidate that we wanted won, and they did very well. There was tremendous enthusiasm.
And with the economy going so strong and so good with all of the things that are happening, including a tremendous foreign affairs picture. If you look at what's going on with so many different elements, including the fact that, right now, flying back are three, what they were calling hostages. We call them fine people. Three really fine people. Seemed to be healthy.
They'll be landing at two o'clock in the morning at Andrews Air Force Base, and I'll be there to greet them. Mike will be with me. It will be, I think, a very special time -- because nobody thought this was going to happen. And if it did, it would be years or decades, frankly. Nobody thought this was going to happen. And I appreciate Kim Jong-un doing this and allowing them to go.
We've picked a time. We've picked a place for the meeting, or summit, as you like to call it. And I think it'll be very successful. But as I always say, Who knows? Who knows what's going to happen. But it's going to be a very important event.
Again, I think this is something that nobody thought was going to happen for years or more. And I really believe it's going to be a great thing for North Korea, a great thing for South Korea and Japan. I want to thank President Xi. He was very helpful to us two days ago on something very specific. President Xi of China. China has been very helpful.
And we're working trade with China. And they're doing okay because they're helping us, and I guess they're probably doing a little bit better because they're helping us. But they have really helped us on North Korea. We appreciate it and we appreciate President Xi.
I just spoke to President Moon and explained what was taking place with respect to the three gentlemen. And President Moon of South Korea was very, very happy to hear it. He, likewise, has been incredibly helpful.
So the relationships we have with Prime Minister Abe, President Moon, President Xi, I think it all goes into what is taking place right now. And we very much look forward to having the meeting between the United States and North Korea. And that will be announced over the next couple of days as to timing.
We have a lot of things going on within our country. We've very much toughened up the border, but the laws are horrible. The laws in this country for immigration and illegal immigration are absolutely horrible. And we have to do something about it -- not only the wall, which we're building sections of wall right now. We have $1.6 billion. We're fixing a lot of wall that basically is non-existent because it's been ripped to pieces. It was poorly built and it wasn't -- it was really only temporary, in some cases.
San Diego has asked us to go forward with their section of the wall in California. And rather than not doing that and letting them lobby for us with Governor Brown, we decided to do it. And we'll have a little bit less of a lobby, but we'll have a lot of people happy in San Diego.
We have, I think, the numbers coming out from the economy. And you're seeing what's going on; they're extraordinary. The stock market is up almost 35 percent from the election, but I think companies are doing even better than that, and they're really ready to rock.
The conference we had yesterday was a very important one. You look at the deal that we had with Iran, it was a one-sided deal that ultimately was going to lead to nuclear proliferation all over the Middle East. And they were talking about it; other countries were talking about it. It was going to lead to that. They are all very happy at what I did. That was a one-sided deal that we spent $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash on getting done. And it was not good, and it was not appropriate.
And we'll see how we do with Iran. Probably, we won't do very well with them, but that's okay too. They've got to understand life, because I don't think they do understand life. If you look at what's happening in the Middle East with Syria, with Yemen, with all of the places they're involved, it's bedlam and death. And we can't allow that to happen.
So we have terminated a terrible, terrible deal that should have never, ever been made. And we will be putting on among the strongest sanctions that we've ever put on a country. And they're going into effect very shortly. They're mostly constituted and drawn already, and we'll just have to see what happens.
But we can't allow a deal to hurt the world. That's a deal to hurt the world; that's not a deal for the United States. That's a deal to hurt the world and, certainly, Israel. You saw Benjamin Netanyahu get up yesterday and talk so favorably about what we did.
Some of the senators, I watch them now as they say, Oh, he shouldn't have done it.
But they don't say it -- the Democratic senators -- they don't say with their full throat; they don't say it with heart. Because they have one problem: They were totally against it. Like Chuck Schumer was totally against the deal. He voted against the deal. He was fighting with Obama. In fact, I remember reading at the time they ended up in a fight together over this deal because he wanted to protect Israel.
And he knows this deal is very bad for Israel and very bad for the Middle East. But I know that they voted against it, and then you'll see Chuck Schumer say, Oh, he shouldn't have ended the deal. It's like, oh -- perhaps he changed his mind. But, by the way, the deal only got worse.
So we have a lot of exciting things happening, and I think that's going to be an exciting thing. And perhaps -- and Iran will never say it because they're great negotiators. Kerry never had a chance against the gentleman he was negotiating with. The first time I saw that man, I watched him on a certain show -- a show of an anchor who is no longer with us. He was taken down. But it was an interesting show. And I looked at him, and after about three minutes of watching the show, I said, There's no way that Kerry can negotiate against this gentleman. And that turned out to be a fact.
So we're going to make either a really good deal for the world, or we're not going to make a deal at all. And Iran will come back and say, We don't want to negotiate. And of course, they're going to say that. And if I were in their position, I'd say that, too, for the first couple of months, We're not going to negotiate. But they'll negotiate, or something will happen. And hopefully that won't be the case.
So I just want to let you know the United States is strong. Our military is in a position that we haven't had in a long time. We have $700 billion approved and $716 billion for next year, numbers that we've never had before. We're rebuilding our military to a level that it's, frankly, never been. And these are good times to have a strong military, and hopefully we'll never have to use it. You know, peace through strength, which I believe in very strongly.
So we're honored by the fact that the three gentlemen are coming home, and I look forward to seeing you -- probably, some of you, maybe a lot of you. It'll be two o'clock in the morning. It'll be quite a scene, and it'll be -- to me, it's very exciting because it represents something. It represents something very important to this country.
People never thought a thing like this could happen and can. People never thought you were going to have a situation where we're having serious and positive communication with North Korea, and we are. What happens? Who knows. We have a chance at something really great for the world and great for North Korea, and great for everyone. So I want to thank you all for being here, and we will see you at two o'clock in the morning. We're very excited.
We're going to announce that in three days, Jon. Within three days.
We're just working arrangements.
It will not be there, no.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it. I want to get it finished. The prize I want is victory for the world, not for even here. I want victory for the world. Because that's what we're talking about. So that's the only prize I want.
Everything can be scuttled. Everything can be scuttled. Doesn't mean -- a lot of things can happen. A lot of good things can happen, a lot of bad things can happen. I believe that we have -- both sides want to negotiate a deal. I think it's going to be a very successful deal. I think we have a really good shot at making it successful. But lots of things can happen. And, of course, you'll be the first to know about it if it fails.
But I think we have a really good chance to make a great deal for the world. Thank you very much.
Iran will find out. They're going to find out. I don't think they should do that. I would advise Iran not to start their nuclear program. I would advise them very strongly. If they do, there will be very severe consequence. Okay? Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

Obedient to that precept of the Constitution which commands the President to give from time to time to the congress information of the state of Union and to recommend to their consideration such measures as shall be judged necessary and expedient, it becomes my duty now to address your body with regard to the grave crisis that has arisen in the relations of the United States to Spain by reason of the warfare that for more than three years has raged in the neighboring island of Cuba.
I do so because of the intimate connection of the Cuban question with the state of our own Union and the grave relation the course which it is now incumbent upon the nation to adopt must needs bear to the traditional policy of our Government if it is to accord with the precepts laid down by the founders of the Republic and religiously observed by succeeding Administrations to the present day.
The present revolution is but the successor of other similar insurrections which have occurred in Cuba against the dominion of Spain, extending over a period of nearly half a century, each of which, during its progress, has subjected the United States to great effort and expense in enforcing its neutrality laws, caused enormous losses to American trade and commerce caused irritation, annoyance, and disturbance among our citizens, and by the exercise of cruel, barbarous, and uncivilized practices of warfare, shocked the sensibilities and offended the humane sympathies of our people.
Since the present revolution began in February, 1895, this country has seen the fertile domain at our threshold ravaged by fire and sword in the course of a struggle unequaled in the history of the island and rarely paralleled as to the numbers of the combatants and the bitterness of the contest by any revolution of modern times where dependent people striving to be free have been opposed by the power of the sovereign state.
Our people have beheld a once prosperous community reduced to comparative want, its lucrative commerce virtually paralyzed, its exceptional productiveness diminished, its fields laid waste, its mills in ruins, and its people perishing by tens of thousands from hunger and destitution. We have found ourselves constrained, in the observance of that strict neutrality which our laws enjoin, and which the law of nations commands, to police our own waters and watch our own seaports in prevention of any unlawful act in aid of the Cubans.
Our trade has suffered; the capital invested by our citizens in Cuba has been largely lost, and the temper and forbearance of our people have been so sorely tried as to beget a perilous unrest among our own citizens which has inevitably found its expression from time to time in the National Legislature, so that issues wholly external to our own body politic engross attention and stand in the way of the close devotion to domestic advancement that becomes a self-contained commonwealth whose primal maxim has been the avoidance of all foreign entanglements. All this must need awaken, and has, indeed, aroused the utmost concern on the part of this Government, as well during my predecessor's term as in my own.
In April, 1896, the evils from which our company suffered through the Cuban war became so onerous that my predecessor made an effort to bring about a peace through the mediation of this Government in any way that might tend to an honorable adjustment of the contest between Spain and her revolted colony, on the basis of some effective scheme of self-government of Cuba under the flag and sovereignty of Spain. It failed through the refusal of the Spanish Government then in power to consider any form of mediation or, indeed, any plan of settlement which did not begin with the actual submission of the insurgents to the mother
country, and the only on such term as Spain herself might see fit to grant. The war continued unabated. The resistance of the insurgents was in no wise diminished.
The efforts of Spain were increased, both by the dispatch of fresh levies to Cuba and by the addition to the horrors of the strife of a new and inhuman phase happily unprecedented in the modern history of civilized Christian peoples. The policy of devastation and concentration, inaugurated by the Captain-General's bando of October 21, 1896, in the Province of Pinar del Rio was thence extended to embrace all of the island to which the power of the Spanish arms was able to reach by occupation or by military operations. The peasantry, including all dwelling in the open agricultural interior, were driven into the garrison towns or isolated places held by the troops.
The raising and movement of provisions of all kinds were interdicted. The fields ware laid waste, dwellings unroofed and fired, mills destroyed, and, in short, everything that could desolate the land and render it unfit for human habitation or support was commanded by one or the other of the contending parties and executed by all the powers at their disposal.
By the time the present administration took office a year ago, reconcentration -- so called -- had been made effective over the better part of the four central and western provinces, Santa Clara, Matanzas, Havana, Pinar del Rio.
The agricultural population to the estimated number of 300,000 or more was herded within the towns and their immediate vicinage, deprived of the means of support, rendered destitute of shelter, left poorly clad, and exposed to the most unsanitary conditions. As the scarcity of food increased with the devastation of the depopulated areas of production, destitution and want became misery and starvation. Month by month the death rate increased in an alarming ration. By March, 1897, according to conservative estimates from official Spanish sources, the mortality among the reconcentrados from starvation and the diseases thereto incident exceeded 50 per centum of their total number.
No practical relief was accorded to the destitute. The overburdened towns, already suffering from the general dearth, could give no aid. So called ""zones of cultivation"" established within the immediate areas of effective military control about the cities and fortified camps proved illusory as a remedy for the suffering. The unfortunates, being for the most part women and children, with aged and helpless men, enfeebled by disease and hunger, could not have tilled the soil without tools, seed, or shelter for their own support or for the supply of the cities. Reconcentration, adopted avowedly as a ware measure in order to cut off the resources of the insurgents, worked its predestined result. As I said in my message of last December, it was not civilized warfare; it was extermination. The only peace it could beget was that of the wilderness and the grave.
Meanwhile the military situation in the island had undergone a noticeable change. The extraordinary activity that characterized the second year of the war, when the insurgents invaded even the thitherto unharmed fields of Pinar del Rio and carried havoc and destruction up to the walls of the city of Havana itself, had relapsed into a dogged struggle in the central and eastern provinces. The Spanish arms regained a measure of control in Pinar del Rio and parts of Havana, but, under the existing conditions of the rural country, without immediate improvement of their productive situation. Even thus partially restricted, the revolutionists held their own, and their conquest and submission, put forward by Spain as the essential and sole basis of peace, seemed as far distant as at the outset.
In this state of affairs my Administration found itself confronted with the grave problem of its duty. My message of last December reviewed the situation and narrated the steps take with a view to relieving its acuteness and opening the way to some from of honorable settlement. The assassination of the Prime Minister, Canovas, led to a change of government in Spain. The former administration, pledged to subjugation without concession, gave place to that of a ~~more liberal party, committed long in advance to a policy of reform, involving the wider principle of home rule for Cuba and Puerto Rico.
The overtures of this Government, made through its new envoy, General Woodford, and looking to an immediate and effective amelioration of the condition of the island, although not accepted to the extent of the condition of the island, although not accepted to the extent of admitted mediation in any shape, were met by assurances that home rule, in advanced phase, would be forthwith offered to Cuba, without waiting for the war to end, and that more humane methods should thenceforth prevail in the conduct of hostilities. Coincidentally with these declarations, the new Government of Spain continued and completed the policy already begun by its predecessor, of testifying friendly regard for this nation by releasing American citizens held under one charge or another connected with the insurrection, so that by the end of November not a single person entitled in any way to our national protection remained in a Spanish prison.
While these negotiations were in progress the increasing destitution of the unfortunate reconcentrados and alarming mortality among them claimed earnest attention. The success which had attended the limited measure of relief extended to the suffering American citizens among them by the judicious expenditure through the consular agencies of the money appropriated expressly for their succor by the joint resolution approved May 24, 1897, prompted the humane extension of a similar scheme of aid to the great body of sufferers. A suggestion to this end was acquiesced in by the Spanish authorities. On the 24th of December last I caused to be issued an appeal to the American people, inviting contributions in money or in kind for the succor of the starving sufferers in Cuba, following this on the 8th of January by a similar public announcement of the formation of a central Cuban relief committee, with headquarters in New York City, composed of three members representing the American National Red Cross and the religious and business elements of the community.
The efforts of that committee have been untiring and have accomplished much. Arrangements for free transportation to Cuba have greatly aided the charitable work. The president of the American Red Cross and representative of other contributory organizations have generously visited Cuba and cooperated with the consul-general and the local authorities to make effective distribution of the relief collected through the efforts of the central committee. Nearly $200,000 in money and supplies has already reached the sufferers and more is forthcoming. The supplies are admitted duty free, and transportation to the interior has been arranged so that the relief, at first necessarily confined to Havana and the larger cities, is now extended through most if not all of the towns where suffering exists.
Thousands of lives have already been saved. The necessity for change in the condition of the reconcentrados is recognized by the Spanish Government. Within a few days past the orders of General Weyler have been revoked; the reconcentrados, it is said, are to be permitted to return to their homes and aided to resume the self-supporting pursuits of peace. Public works have been ordered to give them employment, and a sum of $600,000 has been appropriated for their relief.
The war in Cuba is of such a nature that short of subjugation or extermination a final military victory for either side seems impracticable. The alternative lies in the physical exhaustion of the one or the other party, or perhaps of both -- a condition which in effect ended the ten year's war by the truce of Zanjon. The prospect of such a protraction and conclusion of the present strife is a contingency hardly to be contemplated with equanimity by the civilized world, and least of all by the United States, affected and injured as we are, deeply and intimately, by its very existence.
Realizing this, it appeared to be my duty, in a spirit of true friendliness, no less to Spain than the Cubans who have so much to lose by the prolongation of the struggle, to seek to bring about on immediate termination of the war. To this end I submitted, on the 27th ultimo, as a result of much representation and correspondence, through the United States minister at
Madrid, propositions to the Spanish Government looking to an armistice until October 1 for the negotiation of peace with the good offices of the President.
In addition, I asked the immediate revocation of the order of reconcentration, so as to permit the people to return to their farms and the needy to be relieved with provisions and supplies from the United States, cooperating with the Spanish authorities, so as to afford full relief.
The reply of the Spanish cabinet was received on the night of the 31st ultimo. It offered, as the means to bring about peace in Cuba, to confide the preparation thereof to the insular parliament, inasmuch as the concurrence of that body would be necessary to reach a final result, it being, however, understood that the powers reserved by the constitution to the central Government are not lessened or diminished. As the Cuban parliament does not meet until the 4th of May next, the Spanish Government would not object, for its part, to accept at one a suspension of hostilities if asked for by the insurgents from the general in chief, to whom it would pertain, in such case, to determine the duration and conditions of the armistice.
The propositions submitted by General Woodford and the reply of the Spanish Government were both in the form or brief memoranda, the texts of which are before me, and are substantially in the language above given. The function of the Cuban parliament in the matter of ""preparing"" peace and the manner of its doing so are not expressed in the Spanish memorandum; but from General Woodford's explanatory reports of preliminary discussions preceding the final conference it is understood that the Spanish Government stands ready to give the insular congress full powers to settle the terms of peace with the insurgents -- whether by direct negotiation or indirectly by means of legislation does not appear.
With this last overture in the direction of immediate peace, and its disappointing reception by Spain, the Executive is brought to the end of his effort.
In my annual message of December last I said:
Of the untried measures there remained only: Recognition of the insurgents as belligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a national a rational compromise between the contestants, and intervention in favor of one or the other party. I speak not of forcible annexation, for that can not be thought of. That, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression.
Thereupon I reviewed these alternatives, in the light of President Grant's measured words, uttered in 1875, when after seven years of sanguinary, destructive, and cruel hostilities in Cuba he reached the conclusion that the recognition of the independence of Cuba was impracticable and indefensible, and that the recognition of belligerence was not warranted by the facts according to the tests of public law. I commented especially upon the latter aspect of the question, pointing out the inconveniences and positive dangers of a recognition of belligerence which, while adding to the already onerous burdens of neutrality within our own jurisdiction, could not in any way extend our influence or effective offices in the territory of hostilities.
Nothing has since occurred to change my view in this regard, and I recognize as fully now as then that the issuance of a proclamation of neutrality, by which process the so-called recognition of belligerents is published, could, of itself and unattended by other action, accomplish nothing toward the one end for which we labor -- the instant pacification of Cuba and cessation of the misery that afflicts the island.
Turning to the question of recognizing at this time the independence of the present insurgent government in Cuba, we find safe precedents in our history from an early day. They are well
summed up in President Jackson's message to Congress, December 21, 1836, on the subject of the recognition of the independence of Texas. He said:
In all the contest that have arisen out of the revolution of France, out of the disputes relating to the Crowns of Portugal and Spain, out of the separation of the American possessions of both from the European Governments, and out of the numerous and constantly occurring struggles for dominion in Spanish America, so wisely consistent with our just principles has been the action of our Government, that we have, under the most critical circumstances, avoided all censure, and encountered no other evil than the produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against whom we have been by force of evidence compelled to decide.
It has thus made known to the world that the uniform policy and practice of the United States is to avoid all interference in disputes which merely relate to the internal government of other nations, and eventually to recognize the authority of the prevailing party without reference to our particular interests and views or to the merits of the original controversy.
. . . But on this, as on every other trying occasion, safety is to be found in a rigid adherence to principle.
In the contest between Spain and the revolted colonies we stood aloof, and waited not only until the ability of the new States to protect themselves was fully established, but until the danger of their being again subjugated had entirely passed away. Then, and not until then, were they recognized.
Such was our course in regard to Mexico herself. . . . It is true that with defeated, the chief of the Republic himself captured, and all present power to control the newly organized government of Texas annihilated within its confines; but, on the other hand, there is, in appearance, at least, an immense disparity of physical force on the side of Texas. The Mexican Republic, under another executive, is rallying its forces under a new lender and menacing a fresh invasion to recover its lost dominion.
Upon the issue of this threatened invasion the independence of Texas may be considered as suspended; and were there nothing peculiar in the relative situation of the United States and Texas, our acknowledgment of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regarded as consistent with the prudent reserve with which we have hitherto held ourselves bound to treat all similar questions.
Thereupon Andrew Jackson proceeded to consider the risk that there might be imputed to the United States motives of selfish interest in view of the former claim on our part to the territory of Texas, and of the avowed purpose of the Texas in seeking recognition of independence as an incident to the incorporation of Texas into the Union, concluding thus:
Prudence, therefore, seems to dictate that we should still stand aloof and maintain our present attitude, if not until Mexico itself or one of the great foreign powers shall recognize the independence of the new government, at least until the lapse of time or the course of events shall have proved beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of that country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the government constituted by them. Neither of the contending parties can justly complain of this course. By pursuing it we are but carrying out the long-established policy of our Government, a policy which has secured to us respect and influence abroad and inspired confidence at home.
These are the words of the resolute and patriotic Jackson. They are evidence that the United States, in addition to the test imposed by public law as the condition of the recognition of independence by a neutral state (to wit, that the revolted state shall ""constitute in fact a body politic, having a government in substance as well as in name, possessed of the elements of
stability,"" and forming de facto, ""if left to itself, a state among the nations, reasonably capable of discharging the duties of a state""), has imposed for its own governance in dealing with cases like these the further condition that recognition of independent statehood is not due to a revolted dependency until the danger of its being again subjugated by the parent state has entirely passed away.
This extreme test was, in fact, applied in the case of Texas. The Congress to whom President Jackson referred the question as one ""probably leading to war,"" and therefore a proper subject for ""a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be declared and by whom all the provisions for sustaining its perils must be furnished,"" left the matter of the recognition of Texas to the discretion of the Executive, providing merely for the sending of a diplomatic agent when the President should be satisfied that the Republic of Texas had become ""an independent State."" It was so recognized by President Van Buren, who commissioned a charge d'affaires March 7, 1837, after Mexico had abandoned an attempt to reconquer the Texan territory, and when there was at the time no bona fide contest going on between the insurgent province and its former Sovereign.
I said in my message of December last, ""It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood which alone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor."" The same requirement must certainly be no less seriously considered when the graver issue of recognizing independence is in question, for no less positive test can be applied to the greater act than to the lesser; while, on the other hand, the influences and consequences of the struggle upon the internal policy of the recognizing State, which form important factors when the recognition of belligerency is concerned, are secondary, if not rightly eliminable, factors when the real question is whether the community claiming recognition is or is not independent beyond peradventure.
Nor from the standpoint of expediency do I think it would be wise or prudent for this Government to recognize at the present time the independence of the so-called Cuban Republic. Such recognition is not necessary in order to enable the United States to intervene and pacify the island. To commit this country now to the recognition of any particular government in Cuba might subject us to embarrassing conditions of international obligation toward the organization so recognized. In case of intervention our conduct would be subject to the approval or disapproval of such government. We would be required to submit to its direction and to assume to it the mere relation of a friendly ally.
When it shall appear hereafter that there is within the island a government capable of performing the duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation, and having, as a matter of fact, the proper forms and attributes of nationality, such government can be promptly and readily recognized and the relations and interests of the United States with such nation adjusted.
There remain the alternative forms of intervention to end the war, either as an impartial neutral by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants, or as the active ally of the one party or the other.
As to the first it is not to be forgotten that during the last few months the relations of the United States has virtually been one of friendly intervention in many ways, each not of itself conclusive, but all tending to the exertion of a potential influence toward an ultimate pacific result, just and honorable to all interests concerned. The spirit of all our acts hitherto has been an earnest, unselfish desire for peace and prosperity in Cuba, untarnished by differences between us and Spain, and unstained by the blood of American citizens.
The forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war, according to the large dictates of humanity and following many historical precedents where neighboring States have interfered to check the hopeless sacrifices of life by internecine conflicts beyond their
borders, is justifiable on rational grounds. It involves, however, hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement.
The grounds for such intervention may be briefly summarized as, follows:
First. In the cause of humanity and to put an end to the barbarities, bloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries now existing there, and which the parties to the conflict are either unable or unwilling to stop or mitigate. It is no answer to say this is all in another country, belonging to another nation, and is therefore none of our business. It is specially our duty, for it is right at our door.
Second. We owe it to our citizens in Cuba to afford them that protection and indemnity for life and property which no government there can or will afford, and to that end to terminate the conditions that deprive them of legal protection.
Third. The right to intervene may be justified by the very serious injury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people, and by the wanton destruction of property and devastation of the island.
Fourth, and which is of the utmost importance. The present condition of affairs in Cuba is a constant menace to our peace, and entails upon this Government and enormous expense. With such a conflict waged for years in an island so near us and with which our people have such trade and business relations; when the lives and liberty of our citizens are in constant danger and their property destroyed and themselves ruined; where our trading vessels are liable to seizure and are seized at our very door by war ships of a foreign nation, the expeditions of filibustering that we are powerless to prevent altogether, and the irritating questions and entanglements thus arising -- all these and others that I need not mention, with the resulting strained relations, are constant menace to our peace, and compel us to keep on a semiwar footing with a nation with which we are at peace.
These elements of danger and disorder already pointed out have been strikingly illustrated by a tragic event which has deeply and justly moved the American people. I have already transmitted to Congress the report of the naval court of inquiry on the destruction of the battle ship Maine in the harbor of Havana during the night of the 15th of February. The destruction of that noble vessel has filled the national heart with inexpressible horror. Tow hundred and fifty-eight brave sailors and marines and two officers of our Navy, reposing in the fancied security of a friendly harbor, have been hurled to death, grief and want brought to their homes, and sorrow to the nation.
The naval court of inquiry, which it is needless to say, commands the unqualified confidence of the Government, was unanimous in its conclusion that the destruction of the Maine was caused by an exterior explosion, that of a submarine mine. It did not assume to place the responsibility. That remains to be fixed.
In any event the destruction of the Maine, by whatever exterior cause, is a patent and impressive proof of a state of things in Cuba that is intolerable. That condition is thus shown to be such that the Spanish Government can not assure safety and security to a vessel of the Americas Navy in the harbor of Havana on a mission of peace, and rightfully there.
Further referring in this connection to recent diplomatic correspondence, a dispatch from our minister to Spain, of the 36th ultimo, contained the statement that the Spanish minister for foreign affairs assured him positively that the Spain will do all that the highest honor and justice require in the matter of the Maine. The reply above referred to of the 31st ultimo also contained an expression of the readiness of Spain to submit to an arbitration all the differences which can arise in this matter, which is subsequently explained by the note of the Spanish minister at Washington of the 10th instant, as follows:
As to the question of fact which springs from the diversity of views between the reports of the American and Spanish boards, Spain proposes that the facts be ascertained by an impartial investigation by experts, whose decision Spain accepts in advance.
To this I have made no reply.
President Grant, in 1875, after discussing the phases of the contest as it then appeared, and its hopeless and apparent indefinite prolongation, said:
In such event, I am of opinion that other nations will be compelled to assume the responsibility which devolves upon them, and to seriously consider the only remaining measures possible -- mediation and intervention. Owing, perhaps, to the large expanse of water separating the island from the Peninsula, . . . the contending parties appear to have within themselves no depository of common confidence, to suggest wisdom when passion and excitement have their away, and to assume the part of peacemaker.
In this view in the earlier days of the contest the good offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in good faith, without any selfish purpose, in the interest of humanity and in sincere friendship for both parties, but were at the time declined by Spain, with the declaration, nevertheless, that at a future time they would be indispensable. No intimation has been received that in the opinion of Spain that time has been reached. And yet the strife continues with all its dread horrors and all its injuries to the interests of the United States and of other nations.
Each party seems quite capable of working great injury and damage to the other, as well as to all the relations and interests dependent on the existence of peace in the island; but they seem incapable of reaching any adjustment, and both have thus far failed of achieving any success whereby one party shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other. Under these circumstances, the agency of others, either by mediation or intervention, seems to be the only alternative which must sooner or later be invoked for the termination of the strife.
In the last annual message of my immediate predecessor, during the pending struggle, it was said:
when the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection has become manifest, and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife which means nothing more then the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge.
In my annual message to Congress, December last, speaking to this question, I said:
The near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans and to Spain, as well as equitable to all our interests so intimately involved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken. When the time comes that action will be determined in the line of indisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or hesitancy, in the light of the obligation this Government over to itself, to the people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and honor, and to humanity.
Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated only by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion nor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over the rights and property of American citizens and will abate
none of its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the support and approval of the civilized world.
The long trail has proved that the object for which Spain has waged the war can not be attained. The fire of insurrection may flame or may smolder with varying seasons, but it has not been and it is plain that it can not be extinguished by present methods. The only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which gives us the right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop.
In view of these facts and of these considerations, I ask the Congress to authorize and empower the President to take measure to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between the Government of Spain and the people of Cuba, and to secure in the island the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations, insuring peace and tranquility and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and to use the military and naval forces of the United States as may be necessary for these purposes.
And in the interest of humanity and to aid in preserving the lives of the starving people of the island I recommend that the distribution of food and supplies be continued, and that an appropriation be made out of the public Treasury to supplement the charity of our citizens.
The issue is now with the Congress. It is a solemn responsibility. I have exhausted every effort to relieve the intolerable condition of affairs which is at our doors. Prepared to execute every obligation imposed upon me by the Constitution and the law, I await your action.
Yesterday, and since the preparation of the foregoing message, official information was received by me that the latest decree of the Queen Regent of Spain directs General Blanco, in order to prepare and facilitate peace, to proclaim a suspension of hostilities, the duration and details of which have not yet been communicated to me.
This fact with every other pertinent consideration will, I am sure, have your just and careful attention in the solemn deliberations upon which you are about to enter. If this measure attains a successful result, then our aspirations as a Christian, peace-loving people will be realized. If it fails, it will be only another justification for our contemplated action.
",Message Regarding Cuban Civil War,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Dennis Turner,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"I felt a little diffident about speaking after the comment by the leader of the Social Democratic party, the right hon.
I sincerely thank hon. Members on both sides of the House, and all the workers in the House — the people who serve us our food, the Whips’ Office, Mr. Speaker’s Office, and the Fees Office, which I must not forget — for the warm welcome that I have received and for the courteous and helpful way in which I have been treated. Every hon. Member has helped me in settling into an awesome place. It is an experience that one has to live through to fully appreciate it. I say that in all humility. I am grateful for the help that has been shown to me.
I come to the House following a legend — the legend of Bob Edwards, who was a fine parliamentarian, and who devoted all his life to the interests of the people. If I can serve the people of my constituency one quarter as well as he did, I shall be very pleased.
Bob Edwards made a wider contribution than that, from the days when he sat with Trotsky as a young man, and with Mao Tse Tung. He fought in the Spanish civil war. All that is known to the House. He is such a modest man. He served through the years with such humility. It is a great privilege to follow him. To have had him as a mentor over the past 20 years has been of great value to me.
Bob represented a black country constituency. Many of my constituents expected me to use words such as yow, bay or thear, and wanted me to talk in good black country dialect. However, I shall not do so, only because I have respect and regard for the Hansardwriters. The dialect orginated from the language of Chaucer, but I understand the difficulties of writing down all that I have been saying in black country dialect, so I shall stick to the Queen’s English as we debate the Queen’s Speech.
Bob represented the black country towns of Bilston, Coseley and Sedgley. I now represent, as he did before his retirement, the constituency of Wolverhampton, South-East, which still takes in a large part of the black country. I am a black country man and proud of it. I come here with the spirit of the black country with all that has happened to us over the past few years, some of which has been debated in the past few days.
Many of my black country men would not comprehend what has been said in the speeches over the past few days, I think that they would have difficulty in identifying some of the things that have been said by the Government about the community in which we live in the black country today. Unemployment is 25 per cent. in my constituency. In Wolverhampton, 25,000 good men and women do not have the opportunity to make a useful contribution to society and cannot receive the rewards that would arise from that.
When we talk of unemployment, we must take into account the indignity that comes with it. Independence and freedom have been mentioned often in the past few days. The people whom I represent no longer have the freedom and independence given by the wage packet. A wage packet is important to them, and their dignity, standards and independence are based on that. So I must reconcile that freedom and independence with the difficulties and impoverishment in which many of our people have been placed by being out of work and finding it difficult to cope in present circumstances.
I wonder what I am supposed to say to the lady who came to see me and told me that she was existing on £39.50 a week. Although she received housing benefit, she had to pay for gas and electricity and keep herself on that amount of money. I reflect on that, and on the fact that there must be days in the week on which people, inside and outside the House, spend that much on one meal, yet that person and many thousands of others have to exist week by week on amounts such as that coming into their homes.
It is said that there is investment in housing, but in Wolverhampton we are starved of investment in housing. Year by year, since the Conservative Government came to power—my objective is not to make a political point—we have seen our capital programmes reduced to the extent that our ability to do what we want to in the inner areas has been taken away from us and we are not in a position to make a contribution.
Two thousand five hundred senior citizens and disabled people in Wolverhampton are seeking bungalows or purpose-built sheltered accommodation. We have not been in a position to build a bungalow for the past four or five years. We have estimated that it will take some of the people on that list who are 70 years old now until they are 120 to qualify for the bungalows or sheltered accommodation that they need, because of our lack of ability to provide it.
In Wolverhampton, 74 per cent. of the people are on housing benefit. Is that the freedom and independence that we are told about? What opportunities are afforded them to buy their own homes? Without any ideological hang-up, we— a Labour-controlled council—were selling houses in the 1960s and 1970s, and that is true of many authorities up and down the land. So the idea that tenants were somehow liberated purely by the advent of the Conservative Government is quite erroneous.
If we talk of health, 85 people have been turned away from our hospitals in the past three weeks—people who were seriously ill and could not be provided with a bed when they desperately needed one for emergency treatment. There has been a cut of £3.9 million in our district health authority funding since 1983 — which is not the increase about which we have heard. Recently, because of pressures of finance, we have cut back by 50 per cent. on the incontinence pads that our elderly and disabled people need to be able to live in some kind of decency and comfort. That has happened in the past month.
Will the education that we hear about be education that is uplifting for all, or occasional schools that will be identified and can be moved into the private sector? In the schools in Wolverhampton, there has been a reduction, year after year, in the capital programmes that are needed to improve those schools. There has been chaos in the legislation dealing with teachers, and we know that we cannot now give an education service to our children because of the turmoil that exists. Are we really intending to improve the lot of all our children in all our schools, or that of only a few? We shall see the test of that in the months ahead.
Across all these issues—and there are many more—the reality of people’s lives in my community is different from what is portrayed in the speeches that we have had from Conservative Members. The Father of the House, the right hon. could thou and I with Fate conspire To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire, Would we not shatter it to bits—and then Re-mould it nearer to the Heart’s Desire! That is what we want in our community. We want fresh thinking and application from this House for the real needs of our people. If we do that, we will give people hope where it does not now exist. We can give people the opportunity to believe that they can grow and build.
In our lives, we have infinitesimal time to do what is necessary. Would it not be better now if, together, we were to start building something better, not only for some of the people, but for all of them? That would make a tremendous contribution to the people whom I represent.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-08-15,"Thank you, Adam.
Right.
Right.
So it really is -- and it's something that's taken place in New Hampshire, almost more than in -- proportionately almost well, Ohio, New Hampshire. We have really worked hard on the opioid, as you know, tremendous lawsuits going in against the pharmaceutical companies, and we have it down 16, 17 percent which is tremendous.
That doesn't satisfy anything, but we have it down. The other thing we're trying to do is a non-addictive painkiller, and we're working very hard on that with everybody. The order's out -- get a painkiller that's not so addictive. You know, people go to the hospital, they take like four days of opioids, and all of a sudden they're addicted.
So we're working on that, but we're down 17 percent as of this moment. In fact the first lady is chairing a committee -- she's done an incredible job. She really feels very strongly about it. And then you have the other drug problem in New Hampshire, which are other kinds of drugs, and we're really stopping people now at the border.
We're collecting tremendous amounts, and you're doing much bette,r but we have a lot of very good things coming.
No, because this is what they tell me. I mean, they said we're drug-infested, sir. We're drug-infested. I don't mean that as a -- as a knock. I mean, it's a fact. Take a look at what happens. I mean, it's so many people. And for some reason, and I told you this once before, when I come up to New Hampshire, they always consider it their number one problem, and they call it -- the people -- people I love, that I know up here so well -- you kno,  I have a lot of friends in New Hampshire, and they say it's drug-infested.
and we're really cleaning it out, and the police are doing a great job too.
So, we have a great plan coming out. It's going to be -- if we can take back the House, because we're not going to get the Democrats to vote for it, because they're doing Medicare for All, which is going to take away your freedom, take away your doctors, take away everything that you should be able to have, and most importantly, it's going to take away -- we have 180 million people right now that have private insurance, and they love it, and all of that's going to be taken away.
It's absolute craziness. It -- I mean, on top of everything else, they're looking at 80, 90, 95 percent tax, because there's no -- there's no way they can afford it. But people don't want to go to a hospital, to go to a doctor. They don't want to go. They want to have their own doctor, number one, and we went through this with Obamacare, which we got rid of the individual mandate, by the way, which is very important.
But we have a great health care plan. If we get the House, we hold the Senate, we keep the presidency, we're going to have great health care, much better than Obamacare, at much less cost.
So, we're looking at it right now. We're dealing with a lot of Republicans, very strong conservative Republicans, and we're coming up with a plan if we can. Remember this,  we have a lot of background checks already, people don't realize that. So within the constitution, within all of the rights, and we also have to remember one other thing.
We have to remember that you have a mental illness problem, that's a tremendous problem, and you know, it's not the gun that pulls the trigger. It's the person holding the gun. We have to remember mental illness, and we're working on that, including institutions. We used to have institutions. They were closed for budgetary reasons many years ago.
Everybody was allowed to go out on the streets. We have a real mental illness problem. We're going to have it taken care of. So we'll be working with the Republicans, and ultimately, with the Democrats, to see if something can be done. I don't know if that's possible, but we're working on it.
I think you have voter fraud all over the country. If you look at California if you look at so many other states, in California, they settled -- they had a million people that they found through Judicial Watch, and plenty of other places too. So, we have to stop voter fraud. Voter fraud is a big problem in this country.
There's no question about it.
Well, I'll tell you what. He's outstanding, and if he tells me -- and we will certainly make a decision quickly. But he's a great guy, and if he ran -- I think he could really do amazingly well. He's smart, he's tough. He loves New Hampshire. This is where he -- you know, it all begins and ends in New Hampshire for him, and he loves our country.
So, if he runs I will certainly give it consideration.
Thank you very much.

Hilary Benn,United Kingdom,2015-09-04,"I rise with some trepidation, as I am sure is customary among Members making maiden speeches. There is, however, nothing customary in what I wish to say about my predecessor, Derek Fatchett. His tragic death just six weeks ago left us all the poorer. His family lost a much-loved husband and father; the House lost a fine parliamentarian; the Government lost a first-class Foreign Office Minister; the trade union movement lost a committed advocate of the rights of working people; and, above all, the people of Leeds, Central lost a friend as well as a Member of Parliament.
Derek served his constituents with passion and with distinction. People liked him as well as respected him. That is why his passing is still deeply felt by many, and why he is and will be greatly missed by all who knew him. As the new Member, I am proud to serve the constituency that he served.
Over the years, the strength of the city of Leeds and the source of its prosperity have been both its diversity and its capacity to change with the times. That diversity is reflected in the constituency. Starting from the north, it covers two universities and two hospitals, “Jimmy’s” and the Leeds general infirmary. It takes in the West Yorkshire playhouse. It then runs down across a thriving city centre, and on to a large area of manufacturing—to Holbeck, Hunslet and Beeston, which welcomed the first Kosovar refugees to this country. From Cottingley in the west to Richmond Hill in the east along the York road, each part is a unique community with its own characteristics and traditions. Let me add that the warmth of its people is matched only by their plain speaking.
The constituency contains two other great institutions: the Hunslet Hawks rugby league club, in its splendid stadium in south Leeds, and, of course, Leeds United football club at Elland Road. I shall always have a special affection for Elland Road, because that is where my selection conference took place. As my hon. The ballot box was pitch black. The voting slips piled on the table were a very pale shade of pink—no political significance whatever should be read into that! The faces of the candidates were, to put it mildly, a little grey. But, resplendent in their traditional white, gazing down at us from their picture frames on the wall, were those two great heroes of Leeds United teams gone by, Gordon Strachan and Johnny Giles. I knew at that moment that there was something special about the constituency, and so it has proved.
There is, however, something else about Leeds, Central, which is why I wanted to contribute briefly to this debate. It contains some of the poorest parts of Leeds, and some of the most deprived communities. It has the highest unemployment in the city. For many of the people who live there, social exclusion is not a theory, but their life experience. These are people whose faith in the capacity of the democratic system to produce real and lasting improvement is tested daily by crime, poor housing and social decay.
Perhaps not surprisingly in view of that, Leeds, Central had one of the lowest turnouts in the country at the last general election: only 55 per cent. Just a fortnight ago, only 20 per cent. of the electorate voted in the by-election, under the first-past-the-post system, and in the European elections, under proportional representation. Such a low turnout must be a matter of concern to all of us; but perhaps there is a deeper message than one just about electoral systems. I hope that the House will forgive me if I do not comment today on the relative merits of those systems, let alone the complexities of the d’Hondt system. I do not even understand the Lewis-Duckworth rule when it comes to rain delay in one-day cricket. However, I believe that the link between a Member of Parliament and his or her constituency is very important.
While there are steps that can and should be taken to make voting easier, I believe that the deeper message is this. The true test of our democratic system—and of the House, in the eyes of those who put us here—is whether we can demonstrate in practice to people in a constituency such as Leeds, Central that they can use this place to make a difference to their own lives.
As the community police officer for Lincoln Green said to me last Friday, when I was talking to him about the area which he knows very well and cares about so passionately: People are looking for a sign that things will get better. That statement summarises why the ballot box has to be an instrument of hope as well as of democracy, a means of economic and political progress, and a way out of poverty and despair.
It was that instrument of hope that, at the end of the second world war, created the national health service, and, under the current Government, created the minimum wage and the new deal, of which we are justly proud. I believe that it is that instrument of hope that remains our best chance of meeting the challenges of the new century that will shortly dawn.
Leeds, Central is special, if not unique, in one other respect: the potential of the people who live there to find a voice for themselves. As I travelled round the constituency during the by-election, time and again, I was impressed by the people I met who were not waiting for us to do something, but were trying to do something for themselves.
At the Holbeck community forum, for example, which I visited, 40 people turned out on a Wednesday evening simply to talk about how they could improve the community in which they live. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I visited a supported housing scheme on a tenant-managed housing estate that was providing supported living—and advice, help and a shoulder to cry on—to young people who could not, for whatever reason, continue to live with their own families. The elderly care project based in the Woodhouse Road community centre, which has raised 80 per cent. of its own funds, is now providing a hot breakfast every day for those in the community who might not otherwise get a square meal.
All those people have very high expectations of us, and rightly so: there is much more that we need to do. But those examples—and there are many others—give me hope, because they are a living demonstration that, where a community finds a voice for itself, it is in a much stronger position to tackle the problems about which it knows most. I also believe that, when that happens, our job as Members of Parliament is made that much easier, because we can then add our voice to theirs. If, by doing that, we can together make a difference, we shall be able to demonstrate not only that the House is the servant of those who elect us but that it is something worth voting for.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2014-03-26,"Hello, Greta.
It's one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard by a president. I don't mean just the president of this country. I have never heard a statement like that. I was watching and I heard it, and it was like I can't believe you said it. He just put a big target on Manhattan. I think it's one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard a president make.
I don't know if this man knows what he is doing at all anymore. He was exhausted. He was tired. Looked like he was just exhausted. It was absolutely the dumbest -- I guess I have to say one but maybe I can say the single dumbest statement I have ever heard a president make.
He is not a natural leader. It is very hard for him to lead. He never did it before in his life, and it is very hard for him to lead. But when he talks about nuclear weapons going off in Manhattan where you have millions and millions of people -- I mean, what you are doing is saying this is a target, do it here.
It's so incredible that a president would make a statement like that. I'm not the only one that feels that way, by the way. There are many people. They couldn't believe he said it.
I felt just the opposite. I think most people agree with me. I mean, I don't disagree with you much, but I certainly disagree with you. It shouldn't have been mentioned. It's called out of sight, out of mind. It shouldn't have been mentioned. What does he have to bring that up for?
You know, I have been right about things. I have been right about almost everything. I have been speaking to you for years. Look at China, the other day they just devalued their currency again. They wouldn't have even done that a year ago -- a year and a half ago. They devalued substantially their currency which is devastating for our country.
No, I would say we are going to look and see what happens in '14. I think the republicans are going to have a huge victory because Obamacare is a total disaster, that's hurting a lot of people. I think the republicans are going to pick up a lot of senate seats. After that come January something, where a lot of people are going to make decisions.
I'm certainly looking at it and I will make a decision.
",Interview: Greta Van Susteren Interviews Donald Trump on Fox News' On the Record,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-van-susteren-fox-march-26-2014
David Cameron,United Kingdom,2015-12-21,"This European Council has focused on 3 issues – the UK renegotiation, migration and terrorism.
I talked about the renegotiation last night and I will come back to it shortly – but first the other 2 issues.
Yesterday afternoon, we discussed the ongoing migration crisis facing Europe.
Even with the onset of winter, there are still many migrants coming to Europe – with around 5,000 arriving via the eastern Mediterranean route each day.
Britain has its own strict border controls, which apply to everyone attempting to enter the United Kingdom.
And every day those border controls are helping to keep us safe.
But while we are outside Schengen, we are ready to help our European partners secure their borders.
From the start, the United Kingdom has called for a comprehensive approach that tackles the root causes of this migration crisis – not just the consequences of vast numbers reaching Europe.
That’s why we have provided £1.2 billion in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian conflict and deployed HMS Enterprise and police officers to the Mediterranean to go after the traffickers.
And it’s why we have offered practical assistance to help with the registering and fingerprinting of migrants in countries where they land, like Greece and Italy.
Indeed, we have provided more technical expertise to the European Asylum Support Office than any other country.
Here at this summit, we discussed the importance of implementing the measures previously agreed.
Back in the summer, after some very frank discussions, countries committed to resettle 22,000 refugees from Syria over 2 years and to relocate 160,000 migrants arriving in ‘hotspots’ to other participating countries.
It’s clear from what others have said that very few have been relocated or settled.
Alongside this I announced that the United Kingdom would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees during this Parliament.
And we are meeting the ambition we set out since September, we have resettled over 1,000 Syrian refugees from camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.
They are in homes, their children are in schools and they can look forward to the New Year free from the fear of uncertainty and with the prospect of building a new life in Britain.
And the United Kingdom will continue to play our full part in helping all those affected by the Syrian crisis with the conference we will co-host with Germany, Kuwait, Norway and the UN next February.
Turning to terrorism.
The horrific attacks in Paris last month underline the threat we all face from Daesh.
What happened on a Friday night last month in Paris could have happened in any European city.
We face a common threat. No one country can defeat it alone. We have to defeat it together.
We made important progress last week with provisional agreement between the Council and the European Parliament on new rules to share passenger name records. This is an absolutely vital piece of work.
But there is more we must do.
We need more systematic data sharing so we can track down and stop terrorists.
We must step up our co-operation on aviation security.
We need to go after Daesh’s finances, choking off the oil and money.
We should do more to counter the extremists’ propaganda and their poisonous narrative.
And we must clamp down on firearms and explosives – stopping them from getting into the hands of evil terrorists who are determined to wreak such misery with them.
And I am pleased that we have got a very clear agreement here to rapidly take forward proposals on all these areas.
All of this requires closer co-operation, right now.
Common to both the challenge of migration and the threat of terrorism is the instability in Libya and Syria.
That’s why it’s so important that we work together to support strong, stable and inclusive governance in these countries.
Here today, we have reiterated the EU’s support for the efforts of the International Syria Support Group to end the conflict in Syria through a political process.
And we welcome the agreement reached in Morocco yesterday that we hope will pave the way for a new united national government in Libya.
In an unstable world, Britain is playing a leading role in the EU on issues of security – working with other member states so we better protect our people.
And that underlines why this renegotiation is so important.
As I said last night, we have made good progress.
We are a step closer to agreement on the significant and far-reaching reforms I have proposed.
It is going to be tough and there is lots of hard work to do.
But I believe 2016 will be the year we achieve something really vital fundamentally changing the UK’s relationship with the EU and finally addressing the concerns of the British people about our membership.
Then it will be for British people to decide whether we remain or leave.
It is a choice we will all need to think hard about.
But I believe if we can get these reforms right – and I believe we can I firmly believe that for our economic security and for increasing our national security, the best future for Britain is in a reformed European Union.
Happy to take some questions. Let’s start with the BBC.
Prime Minister, thank you. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. You’ve just given a very clear hint that the vote on our membership of the European Union will be in 2016. Previous major changes in the European Union have taken a long time. The Amsterdam Treaty took 2 years; the Maastricht Treaty took 2 years. How can we be confident that changes you want – if they are a big deal – can be done in 2 months?
And if I may, on Libya, are UK troops going to be intervening?
Okay, first of all, in terms of changes, I’ve been working on this with a clear mandate from the British people ever since the election back in May. And a lot of work has been done. What matters is that these changes are legally binding and irreversible, and I believe we can find ways of setting that out, demonstrating that, in the coming months. Obviously, I want a deal in February, but I’ve set the deadline for the referendum as the end of 2017. I always wanted to give myself time to get this right. What matters is the substance – is getting it right, rather than the timing. That’s the first point.
On Libya, what has happened is a good step forward. It’s not perfect, because not everyone involved in these Libyan political discussions has joined the new government, but we’ve always said that we stand ready to support them with resources, with training, with advice, with capacity building. But frankly, the last thing a new Libyan government wants is a lot of foreign troops on its soil. That is not what we’re proposing. It’s about helping them to build the capacity of a government to run that country.
And why that has a direct impact on us, as it were, back at home, is these 2 reasons. One is, because Libya had become a broken state, the criminal gangs were able to use it as a jumping off point for the migrant boats across the Med, and there weren’t proper authorities for us to work with in Libya to put a stop to that. So the government of Libya is absolutely crucial in being able to deliver an end to that migration route.
But secondly, and in many ways even more significantly, because there is now presence of Daesh in Libya, we need a government to be our partner and work with us – and we should work with them – to do the right thing for their country, which is to make sure that Daesh cannot have a foothold in that country.
So it’s early days; it is an agreement signed rather than a government actually in place, but we should do everything we can to back it and support it. ITV?
Prime Minister, there were reports this morning that you’re being offered an emergency break on in-work benefits for EU migrants, when Brussels agrees the public services risk being under – overwhelmed. Would that remotely be enough?
Well, what I’ve said is, look, my proposal – the 4-year proposal remains on the table. What happened last night is that the European Commission said that they were looking for solutions, not compromises, but were in a negotiation. And I’m convinced that if we work hard between now and February, we’ll find a good answer. George?
George Parker, from the Financial Times. Can I ask another question specific to the renegotiation, about the – your idea of re-designating the EU as a multi-currency union. Are you running into any resistance on that? We hear the President of the European Central Bank is concerned that if you make this explicit that some countries, for example Poland, might see that – decide that they no longer have to join the euro.
Well, there was a lot of discussion about this last night. I think there was a recognition that it’s a statement of fact that the EU has many currencies within it. Now obviously it’s important not just that we say that, but then we go one step further and make sure that you’re not disadvantaged in the single market if you’re outside the single currency. And I think there was a very good discussion about that last night. Of course, countries in the eurozone want to know that they can press ahead with vital integration that they might need without us outside the eurozone stopping them.
And I’ve said, look, my whole point is, I don’t want to stand in the way of the things the eurozone needs to do to make that currency work well. It’s in our interests that it does work well, but likewise it’s very important that we have a set of principles that Britain and other countries outside the euro can’t be put at a disadvantage. And you know, at the heart of this is this issue of not being liable in any way to have your taxpayers’ money spent on eurozone-related issues.
Now, there was a risk of that in the summer, as you know, of the European stability – financial stability mechanism being used to bail out Greece. We stopped that from happening, but we shouldn’t have to, you know, make ad hoc efforts to stop that happening. It should be written down, clearly, the principles of no disadvantage, of no discrimination, of eurozone countries having to pay for eurozone issues.
So it’s – you know, as I said last night, none of the 4 issues are easy to deliver. It’s a mistake to think you’ve got 3 baskets that are progressing towards completion and the fourth is the one with the – all the difficulties in. Each of these areas have problems that need to be resolved. But I felt that in each of the areas there’s sufficient good will to overcome difficulties and come up with a good solution. And in all these areas, as the Commission has said, you know, you’ve got to find answers rather than unsustainable compromises.
Sky News.
Prime Minister, so we now start an 8-week period where Donald Tusk looks for some sort of compromise that meets your needs on migration. Can you guarantee that whatever comes out of this will actually help control EU migration and will lessen EU migration into the United Kingdom?
The whole aim of this is if you stand back from it all why have I chosen these 4 areas? Well they are the 4 things that I think most concern Britain about Europe. People are concerned that it’s becoming a single currency only club and you need guarantees that if you’re outside the single currency you can have the flexibility and the success you need. People want to know, in Britain particularly, that it’s not an ever closer union, that we’re carved out of that. People want to know it adds to competitiveness, not takes away from competitiveness.
And, yes, people want to know that we can help relieve some of the pressure in terms of the movement of people across Europe. Not because Britain is unwelcoming. We’re an incredibly welcoming country. We have one of the most cosmopolitan countries on Earth and people come to Britain and work hard and make a life for themselves. And that strengthens our country. But the British people, and I totally share this view, feel that in recent years the pressure of new arrivals has just been too great.
And part of that pressure is caused by the fact that we have a very generous top-up welfare system which means sometimes that you could – you know, you can train as a – a nurse or a doctor in some less well-off European countries and having finished your training it actually pays you to work in an unskilled job in the United Kingdom rather than continue as a nurse or a doctor in your own country. Now that doesn’t make sense for either side in the European Union and actually there’s a lot of recognition of that that, you know, countries in southern Europe they want to keep the – those talented people to help build their countries.
So while of course there’s a very lively debate and discussion – there was a lively debate and discussion last night. There is an understanding that this is not some unreasonable request. This is a serious issue. It has real impacts for both Britain and for other countries as well. So, yes, as I’ve said, what we’re looking for is a solution rather than just some sort of compromise that won’t have the effect that we want it to – to have. I think the British people fully understand this as well. They know how important the issue of welfare is.
And if you go back to what I said at the election, you know, I basically said on welfare I said there were 4 things we wanted to achieve. First that people who come to Britain cannot claim unemployment benefit for the first 6 months. Well, we’re well on the way to achieving that with the introduction of universal credit. And that is backed and allowed by the European Union. The second thing I said was that people who can’t find a job after 6 months they have to go home. Again that is now pretty much in place. The third thing was the issue of sending child benefit home. I think we’re making very good – not being able to send child benefit home where there’s good progress made in the discussions last night. And the fourth thing was the 4 – no in-work benefit for 4 years where, yes, there’s the lively discussion. The proposal remains on the table and the European Commission has said they’re looking for solutions not compromises.
So I think that is good progress, going back to Laura’s question, in terms of what’s been achieved in the 7 months since the election. You know, we said we’d have a referendum. We’ve passed that legislation. It’s now part of the law of the land. We’ve said we’d have a renegotiation. A lot of people said, you know, “You won’t get 27 other countries to sit down and renegotiate with you.” Well, we have. It’s well under way. We’re making progress in all the 4 areas. Now we’ve got a pretty tight deadline, I accept, to bring it to a close by February. But, you know, I think there’s sufficient goodwill to have a really good go at that. But I’ve left myself some room. I want to get the substance right. This is not about artificial timetables and deadlines and all the rest of it. There’s plenty of time to get the substance that the British people need.
Because this is a massive decision for our country. You think of the terrorists and the security threats that we face. You think of the situation brought about by what Russia has done in Ukraine. You think of the instability in the Middle East, the terrorist threat that that is generating. I think we are better off standing together with our allies and partners in a reformed Europe. But we need to get that reformed Europe in order to make that happen. That’s why if anything this renegotiation has got more important. Because it’s so vital for the future of Britain and I would argue for Europe that we get it right.
And there was a lot of recognition of that last night, of people starting their speeches not by saying they all believe Britain is better off in Europe. They started their speeches by saying that Europe would be better off with Britain in. So this renegotiation has got more important. It certainly hasn’t been solved or fixed but we are well on the way to a deal. We’ve taken some good steps forward. Now we’ve got to bring it home. Thank you very much.
",2015 Press Conference on EU Council,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2015-press-conference-on-eu-council/
Robert Buckland,United Kingdom,2020-03-10,"On 6 December 2019 Joseph McCann was given 33 life sentences at the central criminal court for a series of violent sexual attacks which he committed between 21 April and 6 May that same year. His victims, ranging from an 11-year-old boy to a 71-year-old woman, each suffered a terrifying ordeal, and I pay tribute to them for the courage they showed in giving evidence to secure McCann’s conviction. Mr Justice Edis ordered that McCann serve a minimum of 30 years before being eligible for release on parole.
When he started these attacks, McCann was being supervised on licence by the national probation service, having been released automatically from prison on 15 February, after he had served half of a three-year determinate sentence for burglary and robbery offences, less time spent on remand. However, staff in the national probation service (NPS) south-east and eastern division failed to recall McCann, both when he was remanded into custody on 21 August 2017 and when he received the new sentence on 25 January 2018. Had he been recalled, he would not have been released automatically on 15 February last year; rather, the parole board would have conducted a full risk assessment in order to determine whether it was safe re-release him on licence.
There was only a limited amount which could be shared publicly, whilst we awaited the outcome of McCann’s trial, but under ministerial direction officials re-launched the recall policy framework in early July, giving NPS divisional directors and chief executives of community rehabilitation companies personal responsibility for ensuring that their staff understood the purpose of recall and the threshold for recall. Then, in January this year, alongside the recall policy framework, new mandatory training on recall for all probation staff was launched together ​with fresh operational guidance, to support staff in the judgments they need to make when presented with evidence of an offender’s increased risk or an offender breaching licence conditions.
As a vital part of our service to victims, the NPS offers victims the opportunity to receive a copy of the SFO review, redacted only to fulfil our statutory obligations to protect the rights to privacy of third parties. After McCann had been sentenced on 6 December, NPS victim liaison officers contacted McCann’s victims and asked them whether they would like to meet an assistant chief of probation, in order to have the findings of the SFO review explained to them and to hear the action which has been taken to address the failings which the SFO review sets out. Meetings were then arranged, having regard to the victims’ preferences and availability, the first on 27 February and the final one on 5 March.
Our primary responsibility is towards the victims, which is why I have waited until they have received the full SFO review before announcing further measures.
In order to address the serious concerns which have arisen in this case and to provide wider public assurance, I have decided, exceptionally, to publish a version of the SFO review. This is not the full review, necessarily redacted, which has been shared with McCann’s victims, but it is a thorough and open account of what went wrong in this case and what has been done to put it right.
Further, so we can be absolutely sure that all the lessons of this terrible case have been learned and addressed, I have asked Her Majesty’s chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, to conduct an independent review. Justin has decided that the review will be in two parts: the first by pursuing specific lines of enquiry in relation to the management of McCann in custody and in the community and by considering whether HMPPS has taken all the organisational action necessary to improve practice in the areas in which it was found wanting, the second to take a wider look on the culture and understanding of recall in the probation service. The chief inspector has placed the terms of reference for his review here: https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprobation/about-our-work/inquiriesandreviews.
When I receive the chief inspector’s reports, I will consider whether more needs to be done to strengthen probation practice. I am determined to do all that is necessary to protect the public from known offenders. They, and McCann’s victims in particular, deserve no less.
