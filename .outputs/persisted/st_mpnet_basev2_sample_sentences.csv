Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-11-27,"We're there because virtually every expert that I have and speak to say if we don't go there, they're going to be fighting over here. And I've heard it over and over again. We're in the process of doing some -- you know, as you know we are talking about peace over there with the Taliban, with the group of people that have a lot to do with it. They would like to see it after all these years, and we'll see what happens.
A little bit too early to say what's going to happen. But we are talking about things. But it's a very sad situation when I look -- we have incredible people, incredible fighters. But we're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens. But it's very sad. I just heard about the three people this morning.
Terrible.
At the right time I will.
Let me go off the record because I don't want to get in the middle of the whole thing.
I'd rather not. At some point, I'll talk on the record about it. But I'd rather not.
We think we need it -- we don't think; we desperately need a wall. --
I think that's been shown better than ever in the last short period of two weeks -- that we need a wall. I see the Democrats are going to want to do something, because they understand too. Those pictures are very bad for the Democrats. We're not having a wall because of the Democrats. We need Democrat votes to have a wall.
Now, if we don't get it, will I get it done another way? I might get it done another way. There are other potential ways that I can do it. You saw what we did with the military, just coming in with the barbed wire and the fencing, and various other things.
No, it's the Democrats' fault that we don't have a wall, because they never gave us the vote. They just wouldn't give us the vote. We almost had a deal, except when -- I mean, actually, it wasn't their fault, wasn't our fault, it was on DACA. We almost had a deal, and then the judge ruled shockingly in favor of Obama's signature, when even Obama said what he's doing is not legal.
Essentially, he said, it's not going to hold up. But when the judge ruled, all of a sudden it was like, that's the end of that deal. But we were very close to having a deal -- $25 billion for a wall and various other things on the border. And DACA. And when the judge shockingly -- you know, the Democrats never thought they were going to win that, and then you had another couple of judges rule, and then you had judges rule the other way.
It's going to be settled I assume in the Supreme Court. But we were close to having a deal on DACA until that ruling.
It's not a question of take from McConnell. McConnell is a friend of mine. We get along great. We've had a fantastic relationship. We've had a big success. We've had a lot of success. Hopefully today we'll have another success]; we'll see happens.
I did 4'oclock, 9 o'clock and one in the middle. Based on the enthusiasm we saw there I think we're going to do very well, but we'll see. I know one thing: If she loses, I'll be blamed, and if she wins, I'll be given no credit. That's the only thing I know. But anyway, do you guys want something to drink?
Go ahead.
One of the problems that a lot of people like myself -- we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. You look at our air and our water and it's right now at a record clean. But when you look at China and you look at parts of Asia and when you look at South America, and when you look at many other places in this world, including Russia, including -- just many other places -- the air is incredibly dirty.
And when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small. And it blows over and it sails over. I mean, we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific, it flows, and we say where does this come from. And it takes many people to start off with.
Number two, if you go back and if you look at articles, they talked about global freezing, they talked about at some point the planets could have freeze to death, then it's going to die of heat exhaustion. There is movement in the atmosphere. There's no question. As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it -- not nearly like it is. Do we want clean water?
Absolutely. Do we want clean air to breathe? Absolutely. The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the floor, the floor of the fire they have trees that were fallen, they did no forest management, no forest maintenance, and you can light -- you can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months.
And it's a massive problem in California.
Josh, you go to other places where they have denser trees -- it's more dense, where the trees are more flammable -- they don't have forest fires like this, because they maintain. And it was very interesting, I was watching the firemen and they're raking brush -- you know the tumbleweed and brush and all this stuff that's growing underneath.
It's on fire and they're raking it working so hard, and they're raking all this stuff. If that was raked in the beginning, there'd be nothing to catch on fire. It's very interesting to see. A lot of the trees, they took tremendous burn at the bottom, but they didn't catch on fire. The bottom is all burned but they didn't catch on fire because they sucked the water, they're wet.
You need forest management, and they don't have it.
Yes, we've got a lot of news there.
No, no, but we have plants moving in, too. We do.
No, I'm not because what I'm doing is I'm doing trade deals. The trade deals take a little time. The fact is I think -- I disagree with the Fed. I've been open about that. I think the Fed is a much bigger problem than China. I think that China wants to make a deal very badly. I think we'll either make a deal or we'll be taking in billions and billions of dollars a month in tariffs and I'm okay with either one of those two situations.
But I can tell you that China wants to make a deal. I can tell you that other countries want to make deals because they know that I'm not playing around. The USMCA was a very well-received deal. That got done and a lot of people said it wouldn't get done. We're making great trade deals. We lose $800 billion a year with trade.
Oh, I'm not blaming anybody.
I'm not blaming -- look, I took recommendations. I'm not blaming anybody. But I will tell you, at this moment in time I am not at all happy with the Fed. I am not at all happy with my choice. I think we have to let it go. You know, if you look at -- China is being accommodative. The Euro and Europe is being accommodative.
We're not getting any accommodation, and we're also paying $50 billion, we're paying down our liquidity, is -- you can make the case it's a positive thing in one way, but another thing it snaps your liquidity. So I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed. I'm not happy with the Fed. They're making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.
I'm not blaming anybody.
I'm just saying, I'm not happy with the Fed. So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay. Not even a little bit.
And I'm not blaming anybody, but I'm just telling you I think that the Fed is way off-base with what they're doing, number one. Number two, a positive note, we're doing very well on trade, we're doing very well -- our companies are very strong. Don't forget we're still up from when I came in 38 percent or something.
You know, it's a tremendous -- it's not like we're up -- and we're much stronger. And we're much more liquid. And the banks are now much more liquid during my tenure. And I'm not doing -- I'm not playing by the same rules as Obama. Obama had zero interest to worry about; we're paying interest, a lot of interest.
He wasn't paying down -- we're talking about $50 billion lots of different times, paying down and knocking out liquidity. Well, Obama didn't do that. And just so you understand, I'm playing a normalization economy whereas he's playing a free economy. It's easy to make money when you're paying no interest.
It's easy to make money when you're not doing any pay-downs, so you can't -- and despite that, the numbers we have are phenomenal numbers.
I'm going to listen to what they say. They're all friends of mine and I get along with them great. I'm going to certainly listen to what they have to say, Josh. In the end, though, they're spending massive amounts of billions of dollars. If you look at Iran and what they do, and you look at many other countries -- I don't have to embarrass other countries by saying it -- if you look at what they do, it's a rough part of the world.
It's a dangerous, rough part of the world. But they've been a great ally. Without them, Israel would be in a lot more trouble. We need to have a counterbalance to Iran. I know him. I know him well, the Crown Prince. And, by the way, never did business with them, never intend to do business with them. I couldn't care less.
This is a very important job that I'm doing right now. The last thing I care about is doing business with people. I only do business for us. Somebody said, well, maybe they're an investor in one of his jobs. The answer is no. But I just feel that it's very, very important to maintain that relationship. It's very important to have Saudi Arabia as an ally, if we're going to stay in that part of the world.
Now, are we going to stay in that part of the world? One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a reason because we're producing more oil now than we've ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don't have to stay there.
Well, it's not scheduled, but I certainly would. But it is not scheduled.
I haven't taken anything.
Phil, I haven't done that. If you look at my statement, it's maybe he did and maybe he didn't. But he denies it. And people around him deny it. And the CIA did not say affirmatively he did it, either, by the way. I'm not saying that they're saying he didn't do it, but they didn't say it affirmatively. I'm saying this: We have $52-a-barrel oil right now and I called them about three months ago, before this whole thing happened with Khashoggi, and I let him have it about oil.
We were up to $82 -- probably two and a half months ago -- we were up to $82 a barrel and it was going up to $100 and that would've been like a massive tax increase and I didn't want that. And I called them and they let the oil start flowing and we're at $52. In fact, now I'm being blamed for traffic jams.
This was the greatest. Actually in the Palm Beach Post, they had a thing that I'm causing traffic jams because they have the --
It's the Palm Beach Post.
Phil, I'm getting advice. I'm the president of this country. I have to do what's the best for our country. We have a very important ally in Saudi Arabia. We have an ally that has tremendous oil reserves, which are -- frankly they can make prices go up and down, and I want to keep them down. We have an ally that's investing billions and billions of dollars in our country.
They could very easily invest $110 billion, $450 billion overall over a period of time, fairly short period of time. $110 billion in military. Russia and China would love to have those orders and they'll get them if we don't. They'll have no choice, but they'll get them if we don't. So I take everything into consideration, and again, he totally denies it, and he denied it to me on three different occasions, on three different calls, and a lot of other people deny it, too.
Did he do it? As I said, maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but in the meantime Saudi Arabia's spending billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and I want them to spend it here. I don't want them to spend it in China and Russia.
I am getting a report on that tonight, and that will determine what happens at the meeting. I'm getting a full report on that tonight. That will be very determinative. Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting. We're going to see. But depending on what comes out tonight, we should have a pretty good indication on exactly what happened tonight at about 6 o'clock.
I don't like that aggression. I don't like that aggression at all. Absolutely. And by the way, Europe shouldn't like that aggression. And Germany shouldn't like that aggression. You know they're paying 1 percent, and they're supposed to be paying much more than 1 percent.
They're absolutely not doing enough. Germany? Absolutely not. Many of those countries are not doing enough toward NATO. They should be spending much more money.
He's a fine person.
That I don't know.
I can tell you that Matt Whitaker is a respected man. He's doing an excellent job. We're looking at possible attorney generals right now. And within -- I will tell you, within the Justice Department he is a highly respected person, and he's doing a very good job. I also think he's a very good person. I think he's a very good person.
And he had a reputation for being, I think he was six years in Iowa as the U.S. attorney. He had a reputation for being very strong, very smart, very good.
We don't talk very much. I mean, I haven't spoken to Matt very much. I put him there. But we speak really very little. The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on.
This question has been asked about me now for --
-- almost two years. And in the meantime, he's still there. He wouldn't have to be, but he's still there, so I have no intention of doing anything.
Okay? Thank you, fellas.
",Interview: Donald Trump Speaks with Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker of The Washington Post,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-the-washington-post-november-27-2018
Barack Obama,United States of America,2008-01-08,"Thank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. I love you back. Thank you. Thank you. 
Well, thank you so much. I am still fired up and ready to go. Thank you. Thank you.
Well, first of all, I want to congratulate Senator Clinton on a hard-fought victory here in New Hampshire. She did an outstanding job. Give her a big round of applause. 
You know, a few weeks ago, no one imagined that we'd have accomplished what we did here tonight in New Hampshire. No one could have imagined it. 
For most of this campaign, we were far behind. We always knew our climb would be steep. But in record numbers, you came out, and you spoke up for change. 
And with your voices and your votes, you made it clear that at this moment, in this election, there is something happening in America. 
There is something happening when men and women in Des Moines and Davenport, in Lebanon and Concord, come out in the snows of January to wait in lines that stretch block after block because they believe in what this country can be. 
There is something happening. There's something happening when Americans who are young in age and in spirit, who've never participated in politics before, turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different. 
There's something happening when people vote not just for party that they belong to, but the hopes that they hold in common. 
And whether we are rich or poor, black or white, Latino or Asian, whether we hail from Iowa or New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction. 
That's what's happening in America right now; change is what's happening in America. 
You, all of you who are here tonight, all who put so much heart and soul and work into this campaign, you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness. 
Democrats, independents and Republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded Washington, who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable, who understand that, if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better, there is no problem we cannot solve, there is no destiny that we cannot fulfill.Our new American majority can end the outrage of unaffordable, unavailable health care in our time. We can bring doctors and patients, workers and businesses, Democrats and Republicans together, and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that, while they get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair, not this time, not now. 
Our new majority can end the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of working Americans who deserve it. 
We can stop sending our children to schools with corridors of shame and start putting them on a pathway to success. 
We can stop talking about how great teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness by giving them more pay and more support. We can do this with our new majority. 
We can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists, citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return. 
And when I am President of the United States, we will end this war in Iraq and bring our troops home. 
We will end this war in Iraq. We will bring our troops home. We will finish the job -- We will finish the job against Al Qaida in Afghanistan. We will care for our veterans. We will restore our moral standing in the world.
All of the candidates in this race share these goals. All of the candidates in this race have good ideas and all are patriots who serve this country honorably. 
But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago is because it's not just about what I will do as president. It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it. 
That's what this election is all about. 
That's why tonight belongs to you. It belongs to the organizers, and the volunteers, and the staff who believed in this journey and rallied so many others to join the cause. 
We know the battle ahead will be long. But always remember that, no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change. 
We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. And they will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks and months to come. 
We've been asked to pause for a reality check. We've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope. 
Yes we can.
Yes we can.
Yes we can. 
Yes we can -- to opportunity and prosperity.
Yes we can heal this nation.
Yes we can repair this world.
Yes we can. 
And so, tomorrow, as we take the campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile workers in Spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in Las Vegas, that the hopes of the little girl who goes to the crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of L.A., we will remember that there is something happening in America, that we are not as divided as our politics suggest, that we are one people, we are one nation. 
Thank you, New Hampshire.
Thank you. Thank you.
",New Hampshire Primary Concession Speech,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamanewhampshireconcessionspeech.htm
George Osborne,United Kingdom,2015-11-28,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming – and thank you for asking me to speak again to the British Chambers of Commerce.
I spoke to this Chamber three years ago. I said then that relations between Britain and Hong Kong had always been deep and strong – but I said that the economic relationship could be even deeper and stronger.
That has proved to be the case. Thanks to the work of the British Chambers of Commerce and its members, Hong Kong and the UK are now doing more business together than ever before.
I want to talk to you today about the opportunities that this deeper integration brings for both our countries.
But as two of the most open, free-trading, financially connected places on earth, we also understand more than most that deeper global integration brings new risks as well.
And so I also want to talk about what we can to do tackle those global risks head-on, both internationally through organisations like the G20, and in countries like the UK.
Of course Hong Kong and Britain have always had a special bilateral relationship.
That’s about much more than our historic and legal ties.
It’s about our shared values.
It’s about the influence that your culture has had on British life – and that our culture has had here.
It’s based on the thousands of Hong Kongers who study and work in Britain and the quarter of a million British citizens who choose to work here in Hong Kong.
And of course it is also about our inextricably intertwined economies.
So whereas others could make the mistake of seeing Hong Kong as nothing more than a jumping point for trade with mainland China, we in Britain know just how important Hong Kong is as a destination its own right.
You are the UK’s second largest market for goods in the Asia-Pacific.
You are the source of just under 30% of the profits of two of the UK’s largest banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered
More investment comes to the UK from Hong Kong than from the USA, Canada and Singapore combined.
This relationship brings jobs and prosperity for both our economies.
Just look at companies like Hutchinson Whampoa, who I’m seeing after this. It is the single largest foreign investor in the UK. It is responsible for around 35,000 jobs in everything from ports to telecoms to the water supply.
Look at companies like MTR, who I am also visiting later today. They run two of the main commuter rail lines in London and the South East of the UK.
Over here in Hong Kong they are working with British firms like Kier and Laing O’Rourke to deliver new infrastructure projects including the extension of Admiralty Station and the new high speed rail link to the mainland, which I am looking forward to seeing later.
And it is not just about large global players.
This year, while the Shangri-La hotel opens in London’s biggest skyscraper, the Shard…
…On the other side of the river a small Hong Kong tech company called Advanced Merchant Payment will be opening in London’s Tech City.
They will be providing innovative financial services to SMEs and their banks.
And when they wanted to expand outside Asia, they choose to come to our country first – because we have the best environment for start-ups, a world class financial services industry, and one of the most open and competitive economies in the world.
It’s only been three months since I was last here. But even in those three months I detect growing optimism about the economy here – and across Asia.
And every time I come here I sense the energy and the ambition of a continent assuming its place at the heart of the global economy.
Of course Hong Kong is also hugely important to us as the prime gateway to and from one of the biggest parts of that global economy – mainland China.
Almost a tenth of all our exports into China flow via Hong Kong. That’s a huge proportion.
And almost two thirds of all Chinese outward investment comes through here in one form or another.
But Hong Kong has this special position because of its own inherent strengths.
Three hundred British firms base their regional headquarters here, not just because of Hong Kong’s prosperity.
But also because of Hong Kong’s stable government and strong legal system.
As my colleague, the Foreign Secretary, said this month: Hong Kong’s success is underpinned by its autonomy, rights and freedoms – guaranteed by the Joint Declaration- and the best way to preserve Hong Kong’s strengths is through a transition to universal suffrage which meets the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong.
How that is achieved is for the people of Hong Kong, and the governments of Hong Kong and China to decide.
What I want Britain to do is to build on this special relationship with Hong Kong, so that together we can be a bridge – and not a barrier – to trade between mainland China and the world.
For strengthening the relations between China and the UK has been a very important personal priority of mine as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
When I was last here in Hong Kong, before Christmas, I arrived off a ferry from Zhuhai, at the end of a long visit to China and after the conclusion of a very successful Economic and Financial Dialogue between our two nations in Beijing.
Those talks represented the next big step forward in the UK-China relationship.
For the first time ever, the door was opened to Chinese investment in civil nuclear power.
Millions of pounds of Chinese investment in other British infrastructure projects were secured.
And new opportunities for British exports to China – already up 80% in 3 years – were secured as well.
And when the Prime Minister led a trade mission to China last December, the delegation struck £5.6 billion pounds worth of business deals between our two countries.
For this is a two-way relationship of equals. Gone are the days when the British finance minister was only interested in securing greater market access to China.
That’s still important, but just as important now is Chinese investment and access to the UK.
Nowhere is that more apparent than in the development of the use of China’s currency, the Renminbi.
Hong Kong knows that well – you are the largest offshore centre for RMB in the world.
London’s position as the Western centre of RMB trading has been greatly strengthened as a result of this collaboration with Hong Kong.
Now almost two thirds of all RMB payments outside of China and Hong Kong take place in London.
Now London firms are able to invest directly in Chinese stocks and shares in RMB – something that’s just not currently possible anywhere else in the West – thanks to our agreement with the Chinese Government last year.
Now Chinese banks are going to be able to apply to set up wholesale branches in the UK, for the first time.
And we are now the first country in the G7 to agree an RMB swap line with the People’s Bank of China, giving London investors the confidence to expand their RMB activities.
Ultimately what we all want to see is RMB being used more and more as a currency of choice in the world.
And that’s why today I want to go further.
So I can tell you today that the UK and Chinese Governments are in active discussions about the appointment of a Renminbi clearing bank in London.
Recognising London’s role as the Western centre of offshore RMB trading, I am also announcing today that we will be hosting the first International RMB Conference in London this summer – and it will be sponsored by an array of British, Chinese and International Banks from HSBC to ICBC, from Standard Chartered, RBS and Barclays to Bank of China and the China Construction Bank, from Citi, JP Morgan and ANZ to the Agricultural Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and others.
In the Economic and Financial Dialogue last October we said we wanted to see greater collaboration between financial services firms in the UK and China.
Well, today I am very pleased to see exactly that, with the announcement that the Chinese firm, E Fund Management – who I believe are here with us today – will be partnering with a London firm, ETF Securities, to launch a new investment product on the London Stock Exchange. That product will allow people in the West to invest directly in Renminbi in Chinese companies. It’s just one example of the growing links between our financial sectors.
These steps will bring the UK and China closer together, and promote trade and commerce.
But I also want to promote the exchange of ideas and better understanding between both our countries.
That’s why I want to make the UK the prime destination for tourists from this part of the world. Almost three hundred thousand Chinese tourists come to the UK each year, and that number is growing by 40% a year.
I want to make it easier for tourists from the mainland to visit. So I am pleased to announce today that even more British retailers, such as John Lewis, are going to start accepting payments in Renminbi.
I also want to strengthen our relationship by encouraging more students from China and Hong Kong to come to our world-class universities. We already have over 100,000 Chinese students studying in the UK each year.
Today I can announce a new collaborative programme between leading universities in China and the Russell Group of UK universities on the key challenges we all face. We’re going to work together, with leading businesses to find answers to the problems of urban development, public health, energy and transport, the digital economy and financial reform.
And I want students in Britain to understand Asia better as well. Which is why today I am also announcing a new grant for Chinese language teacher training in 50 London schools. My ten year old daughter is already learning Mandarin – I want thousands more children in Britain to learn this language of the future world economy.
These are just a few small steps forward in a relationship between Britain, Hong Kong and China that gets deeper and richer every year.
For me the relationship is about more than economics and the bottom line. It’s about how we view our world and the extraordinary change it is going through.
For some see the rise of China, the success of Hong Kong, the growth of Asia as a threat to the West. They call it a ‘race to the bottom’ and they want Western countries like mine to pull up the drawbridge and close the shutters.
I think that would be a tragedy for us all – and leave us all impoverished.
This is not a race to the bottom.
We should not see growth in China and Hong Kong as a threat to us or something to be afraid of.
We should see it as a huge opportunity. Get it right and it means jobs and investment in London and the whole of Britain. Economic success in Asia can bring economic security at home. An opportunity for us as well as for you.
But only if we work through our long term economic plan.
Of course, as we’ve seen over these recent years, closer global integration also brings global risks. And if we get it wrong – if we don’t tackle those risks head on – then those risks will threaten our economic security.
Today I am on my way to the first G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting of the year, in Sydney.
We might have hoped that this would be the first time in five years that the G20 has met outside of a global crisis.
The risk of a eurozone collapse has greatly receded, and the prospect of a destabilising standoff over the US fiscal position now looks much less likely.
But as well as reasons to be cheerful, there are also reasons to be careful.
Many economies in Europe remain very weak.
Problems in the Middle East abound.
And in recent months we have seen volatility in several emerging markets, with currencies weakening by up to 19%, bond yields spiking by up to 11%, and sudden falls in equities markets across Latin America and Asia.
Most emerging markets are more robust than they were in the late 1990s, and in many cases flexible exchange rates are functioning correctly as shock absorbers.
But if we have learnt anything from the recent Great Recession, it is that in this interconnected global economy one country’s problem can very quickly become everyone else’s problem.
And acting early when risks emerge can head off much greater damage later on.
My message here in Hong Kong is this:
The risks to economic recovery have not gone away.
Together we need to act now to ensure that emerging market problems don’t contribute to a new crisis.
How do we do that?
By each one of us putting our own houses in order.
And by using the G20 to make sure we all confront our problems instead of running away from them.
As we meet in Australia, the G20 is more than capable of doing that; provided we focus on the important issues.
But there is a danger that in Sydney and other such meetings we find ourselves distracted by a pointless debate about US and UK monetary policy…
…that the G20 descends into a blame-game…
…and we miss the opportunity to drive through, together, the reforms that are necessary to safe-guard the global recovery.
To avoid that happening we need to understand better what the last six years have taught us about how global coordination works.
In particular we need to understand that international coordination can work and has worked when it holds governments to account for domestic reforms, but not when it tries to impose global macroeconomic policies that are against countries’ own self interests.
Fostering domestic resilience from the bottom up is the best way to build global resilience at the top.
For example, many people have identified global macroeconomic imbalances between surplus and deficit countries as a major contributing factor to the Great Recession a few years ago.
With some exceptions, those macro imbalances have now dramatically reduced – China’s current surplus came down from over 10% in 2007 to 2.3% in 2012, and the US current account deficit fell from 4.7% in 2007 to 2.7% in 2013.
Has this therefore been a triumph of external pressure against US and Chinese self-interest?
That would obviously be a misunderstanding of the real forces at work.
China has not reduced its current account surplus because of external pressure by international bodies like the IMF or G20– they’ve done it because the Chinese understand it is in their self interest to move away from an investment and export led model of growth towards something more sustainable.
In fact it is hard to find examples in history of a surplus economy taking action to rebalance demand in response to external pressure.
Equally the US has not reduced its current account deficit because of international pressure – it has been a product in large part of the shale revolution and improved US competitiveness. Indeed we can go further – the initial macro imbalances were not in themselves the major cause of the crisis.
Capital flows from East to West and from surplus countries to deficit countries did indeed reduce global interest rates.
But those low interest rates did not induce financial crises in countries with robust domestic frameworks. Canada did not have a banking crisis or a fiscal crisis. Nor did Sweden. It was not the overall net flows from East to West that turned out to be the problem.
It was poor domestic regulation in the US and much of Europe of some specific capital flows – particularly into housing and commercial real estate assets – and poor domestic regulation of the banks who held many of those assets.
Equally it was poor economic and fiscal management in many of those same countries which left their economies so vulnerable to the ensuing banking crisis.
None more so than the UK. We went into the crisis with the biggest structural deficit in the G7 and with the most leveraged households and banks of any major economy and we paid a heavy price for that failure of policy.
And of course it was the underlying flaws in the institutions of European monetary union that made the impact so catastrophic and long lasting in the eurozone.
So in fact it was a lack of resilience at a national level in several important economies that created a lack of resilience at a global level.
Exactly the same is true now when we look at the risks in emerging markets.
I can see that it is tempting for some to blame Western monetary policy for economic problems in some emerging markets, but this is neither accurate nor useful.
Not accurate because, while tapering of US monetary policy in response to a strengthening domestic recovery may have been the trigger for instability it is not the real cause.
The underlying causes are domestic fragility in those countries, often built up over a long period of time – and that is why some emerging markets have been much more affected than others.
And blaming Western monetary policy is not useful because it doesn’t lead us to any sensible solutions.
The Fed does not and indeed should not set monetary policy to be appropriate for emerging markets – the Fed has a legal and democratic requirement to set monetary policy to be appropriate for the US economy.
The fact that it is currently tapering its programme of quantitative easing is a sign of success.
Equally I know that UK citizens would be rightly outraged if Mark Carney and the Bank of England set UK monetary policy decisions on the basis of what was best for other economies. So at this G20 we should avoid finger pointing and distractions.
There is an alternative.
The alternative is to focus on building domestic resilience – not just in emerging markets, but also in developed economies.
The alternative is to use the G20 to hold governments accountable for these domestic reforms, rather than allowing them to escape accountability by blaming their problems on others.
And that alternative is exactly the plan put forward by my colleague Finance Minister Joe Hockey and the Australian presidency.
Under that plan, the G20 members will sign up to comprehensive and ambitious national reform agendas – and then hold each other to account for delivering them.
That is exactly the right approach because it tackles the underlying problems head-on. I’m ready for the UK to play its part and I hope this approach is adopted by the G20 later this year. We all need to get our houses in order.
We all have to put in place the four fundamentals necessary for economic security: responsible fiscal policy; credible institutions; effective financial regulation; and crucially, the long term structural reforms that will deliver lasting prosperity.
It is a lack of these foundations that caused the financial crisis in developed economies, and the recent troubles in some emerging markets.
Just look at those developed economies who had these foundations for economic security in place, and how much better they performed in the financial crisis.
Look at Australia, where I’m heading tomorrow. Thanks to robust financial regulation and the reforms of the John Howard government many years ago they grew through the crisis when many others were shrinking.
Or look at Canada, who were also in control of the risks in their financial system. They bounced back from the 2009 crisis extremely quickly – by 2010 they were growing by 3.4%!
The same is true of Sweden, who grew by an astonishing 6.6% in 2010 and then 2.9% the year after that.
Unsurprisingly we see the same pattern with emerging markets now – those who had the fundamentals in place, who have taken the difficult decisions to reform, have avoided the worst of the volatility.
Compare the relative calm we’ve seen in countries like Mexico and Peru with the experience of some of their neighbours.
Look at Malaysia, now growing at 5.4%.
And we have also seen other economies taking up these reforms, to head off future threats.
Last October, for example, I was speaking to the Vice Premier of China, Ma Kai, about China’s comprehensive economic reform plan.
The plan that the Chinese leadership went on to set out at the Third Plenum tackles exactly the fundamentals I’ve talked about – by allowing markets to play a greater role; strengthening financial sector regulation, including around shadow banking; and establishing the next generation of free trade pilot zones to boost trade and investment.
And as a result, I am confident that when these reforms are implemented they will not just make China more resilient, but make the whole global economy more resilient.
This is where global coordination can be really effective.
We’ve already seen that the G20 works when it focuses on the painstaking process of coordinating reforms, and holding governments to account for delivering them.
The G20 has played a crucial role in reforming financial regulation – setting deadlines for agreement and tasking the Financial Stability Board and Basel committees to meet those deadlines.
Now Basel three is being implemented; so too, new global rules on derivatives; and as Mark Carney has said, this year we must secure an international solution to the too big to fail problem in banking. The G20 can resist moves to global protectionism – as it has done remarkably well in these recent years – and promote new trade agreements.
The G20 and the IMF have important roles in coordinating balanced and responsible fiscal consolidation plans, though there is still more to do.
And because the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, put international tax evasion and tax avoidance at the centre of our G8 Presidency, the Australian Presidency of the G20 has been able to pick up the baton and for the first time we have the real prospect of new, tough and fair global tax rules.
This kind of international cooperation works.
And so the Australians are completely right to take this to the next level, and ensure we have comprehensive plans to make our countries more resilient. Not just emerging markets, but countries like the UK as well.
And so I want to end by talking about what the UK has to do.
The UK went into the crisis with the largest structural deficit in the G7, the highest household debt and the most leveraged banks of any major economy.
By the time I came into Government, we had experienced one of the greatest falls in GDP of any major economy, and our deficit was forecast to be larger than any other in the G20.
So we set out in 2010 a long term economic plan to restore economic security and prosperity. And we have worked through that plan ever since.
Stuck to it when critics told us to abandon it and come forward with a Plan B – we held our nerve.
Now, four years on…
– We have brought the deficit down by a third, and set out credible fiscal plans that will eliminate the deficit within four years.
– We’ve overhauled our regulatory system, and we’ve given the Bank of England cutting-edge macroprudential powers.
– We’re ending too big to fail in our banking system – we’ve gone further and faster than anyone else, and the rest of the world is following our lead.
– And we have sought to make Britain aggressively competitive.
I have cut corporation tax again and again – from next year it will be the lowest in the G20 and one of the lowest in the world.
We’ve made the UK the location of choice for multinational company head quarters. The City of London has become stronger and bigger.
We have reformed university funding and spent on science, so that British universities can remain world-leading.
We’ve invested in infrastructure – the largest infrastructure project in Europe is being tunnelled under London as we speak.
Far from shying away from difficult issues like Nuclear energy and fracking – my government is leading the way in Europe.
And we are attracting more investment from China than any other European economy.
Indeed, more investment from the rest of the world than any other country in the European Union.
As a result of this long term economic plan, we are growing.
In fact, the UK is now growing faster than any other major European economy.
We’ve had the strongest growth in employment in our history.
Unemployment has come down sharply.
And it’s encouraging to see growth that’s not fuelled by debt, and not just concentrated in services but in manufacturing and construction too.
Some in Britain might be tempted to say: job done, let’s avoid more hard decisions.
That would be a huge mistake.
Abandon the plan and we abandon the progress we’ve made and go back to square one.
I have never been a Chancellor who has run away from confronting our problems.
I’ve never been afraid to level with people about the hard truths.
I said that we have to go on dealing with our debt and our deficit – and we have no choice but to do so.
I said recovery was not enough, we needed to avoid the mistakes of the past.
So I’m now the first to say that the recovery is not yet secure and our economy is still too unbalanced.
We cannot rely on consumers alone for our economic growth, as we did in previous decades.
And we cannot put all our chips on the success of the City of London, as my predecessors did.
Britain is not investing enough.
Britain is not exporting enough.
There are encouraging signs. Both business investment and exports are forecast to grow.
But we can’t be passive observers of the forecasts.
We need to roll up our sleeves, get to work and make it happen.
I am delivering my Budget in four weeks time.
This is not a budget where we can rest on our laurels and say “job done”.
It is a budget where we must confront our problems and deal with some hard truths.
A Budget that safeguards our recovery in the face of ever present global threats.
But more than that:
I want to deliver a Budget that supports a Britain that invests and that exports.
A Budget that lays the foundations for our long term economic security.
And a Budget which ensures that around the world, wherever you are, you can’t help but see “Made in Britain”. That’s the budget I’m going to deliver.
For ultimately what is the goal of all this?
Of global coordination, of domestic reforms, of sticking to our plans?
It is a future where the global economy is resilient in the face of economic storms.
It is a future of jobs, and prosperity, and peace of mind.
It is economic security, for all our citizens.
Here in Hong Kong, and in Britain and around the World.
Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-11-14,"Hello, everybody. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. And thank you very much, everybody. I'm grateful to be here today with members of the House and Senate who have poured their time -- and they really have -- their heart, and energy into the crucial issue of prison reform.
A very respected man -- Chairman Chuck Grassley -- and my friend. Where's Chuck? Chuck? Thank you, Chuck, very much. You've worked hard on this. And Bob Goodlatte. I saw Bob here. Thank you, Bob. Great job. Senators Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, Tim Scott, Rand Paul, and Doug Collins -- fantastic people who've worked so hard and we appreciate very much what you've done. We really do. Thank you all very much.
Working together with my administration over the last two years, these members have reached a bipartisan agreement. Did I heard the word ""bipartisan""? Did I hear -- did I hear that word. Bipartisan agreement on prison reform legislation known as the FIRST STEP. And that's what it is; it's the first step. But it's a very big first step.
Today, I'm thrilled to announce my support for this bipartisan bill that will make our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life after they have served their time. So important.
And I have to tell you, I was called, when I announced and when we all announced together this news conference, by some of the toughest, strongest law enforcement people -- including politicians, by the way -- who are so in favor of it. And I was actually surprised by some. No, it's got tremendous support at every level. It's really great.
And we're all better off when former inmates can receive and reenter society as law-abiding, productive citizens. And thanks to our booming economy, they now have a chance at more opportunities than they've ever had before. It is true. Our economy is so strong, that when people are getting out of jail, they're actually able to find jobs.
And I have three instances of companies that hired people coming out of prison, and they are so thrilled by the performance of these people. And now they're doing it more and more and more. And a lot of people are seeing this. It's great.
They wouldn't have had the opportunity, frankly, except for the fact that the economy is so strong. And our job market is the lowest and best it's been in over 50 years, and seems to be getting even better.
Our pledge to hire American includes those leaving prison and looking for a very fresh start -- new job, new life. The legislation I'm supporting today contains many significant reforms, including the following:
First, it will provide new incentives for low-risk inmates to learn the skills they need to find employment, avoid old habits, and follow the law when they are released from prison. These incentives will encourage them to participate in vocational training, educational coursework, and faith-based programs -- and I want to thank Paula White, very much, because I know you very much wanted that -- thank you, Paula -- that reduce their chances of recidivism, and, in other words, reduce their chances of going back to prison substantially.
Second, this legislation will allow federal inmates to be placed closer to their home communities in order to help facilitate family visitation -- so important -- because we know that maintaining family and community ties is key to successful reentry into our society.
Third, the bill includes reasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off our streets. In many respects, we're getting very much tougher on the truly bad criminals -- of which, unfortunately, there are many. But we're treating people differently for different crimes. Some people got caught up in situations that were very bad.
I give an example of Mrs. Alice Johnson, who served 21 years. And she had, I think, another 25 or so to go. So she would have been in there for close to 50 years for something that other people go in and they get slapped on the wrist -- which is also wrong, by the way. Which is also wrong. But I'll never forget the scene of her coming out of prison after 21 years and greeting her family and everybody was crying. Her sons, her grandsons -- everybody was crying and hugging and holding each other. It was a beautiful thing to see. It was a very much tough situation.
Among other changes, it rolls back some of the provisions of the Clinton crime law that disproportionately harmed the African American community. And you all saw that and you all know that; everybody in this room knows that. It was very disproportionate and very unfair.
Throughout this process, my administration has worked closely with law enforcement. Their backing has ensured that this legislation remains tough on crime -- it's got to remain very tough on crime -- and supports the tremendous work of our police and the tremendous job that law enforcement does throughout our country, our communities. They do an incredible job. We have great respect for law enforcement.
We're honored that seven of the major police organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Police Chiefs, have fully endorsed this bill.
We could not have gotten here without the support and feedback of law enforcement, and its leaders are here today -- two of them -- especially Chuck Canterbury of FOP and Chief Paul Cell of IACP. Thank you very much. I appreciate that very much. And these are two tough cookies. They want what's right.
And interesting -- if you look at Texas, if you look at Georgia, if you look at Mississippi and Kentucky and some other states that are known as being very tough -- these are big supporters of what we're doing. And some of it has been modeled after what they've done. They've done a tremendous job.
My administration will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement, and we will continue to pursue policies that help the heroes who keep us safe. They are truly heroes.
We also thank the more than 2,000 leaders in the faith community who have signed a letter of support. We have tremendous support within the faith community. Unbelievable support.
Americans from across the political spectrum can unite around prison reform legislation that will reduce crime while giving our fellow citizens a chance at redemption. So if something happens and they make a mistake, they get a second chance at life.
Today's announcement shows that true bipartisanship is possible. And maybe it'll be thriving, if we're going to get something done. When Republicans and Democrats talk, debate, and seek common ground, we can achieve breakthroughs that move our country forward and deliver for our citizens. And that's what we're doing today. And I have great respect for the people standing alongside of me.
I urge lawmakers in both the House and Senate to work hard and to act quickly and send a final bill to my desk. And I look very much forward to signing it. This is a big breakthrough for a lot of people. They've been talking about this for many, many years.
I want to thank Jared Kushner for working so hard on the bill. Thank you, Jared. He really did. He worked very hard. He feels very deeply about it. And it's my honor to be involved and it'll be an even greater honor to sign.
So good luck, Chuck and Mike and Rand and everybody -- Lindsey, everybody back here. Go out and see if you can get that done. And if you can, I'm waiting. I'll be waiting with a pen. And it's the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Announces Support for Bipartisan Prison Reform Bill,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-prison-reform-november-14-2018
Kerry McCarthy,United Kingdom,2020-06-20,"I congratulate Marcus Rashford on spearheading this campaign. He is an amazing role model, both on the pitch and off it. His speaking out on how his mother struggled to make ends meet and how he would turn up at his friends’ houses in the hope of being fed resonated across the country, and there are far too many other young kids like Marcus out there.
Last year, I was one of the MPs who served on the children’s future food inquiry, and we heard devastating accounts from children, not just about raw and real hunger, but about living on leftovers, scraps or cheap food with little to no nutritional value. It should not take a famous footballer speaking out about his experiences as a child; the Government should have listened to those children back then in April last year and implemented the children’s right to food charter.
Of course I welcome this U-turn, but we need to embed it, so that we do not have to have this argument every time the school holidays come around. This move alone will not be enough. For far too many children, their free school meal is the only decent meal they get, and the under-fives do not even get that.
In Bristol, we will still be running our healthy holidays scheme this year, which is about far more than just providing a meal, but it looks as though we will have to do so without Government support. Feeding Bristol was fortunate enough to be a holiday hunger pilot in 2018, but last year we were not so lucky and we do not know why. We got nothing from the Government, but we raised £100,000 and we did it ourselves, albeit to a more limited degree than we would have liked. In 2020, we again missed out, apparently by just one point, but again we have no idea why. The Mayor of Bristol and I both wrote to the Government asking why some cities and towns were getting six-figure or even seven-figure sums but Bristol was getting nothing. We suggested ​spreading the money more evenly so that many more schemes could be pump-primed, but we have not had a response.
We know that covid-19 has made many more families financially vulnerable and those who were already vulnerable even more so. I pay a particular tribute to FareShare, which has been fantastic throughout this crisis. Again, let us congratulate Marcus Rashford on raising £20 million for its national effort. In the past week alone, 80 tonnes of food came to Bristol via FareShare South West, but this is not, as the Government would have it, just about this summer and coping with the fallout from the pandemic. People have been attending food banks in record numbers since the economically illiterate, morally bankrupt policy of austerity was adopted a decade ago. The Government have consistently refused to acknowledge the sheer scale of the problem, to engage with those working on the frontline, or to address the underlying causes of food poverty, and it is time that they did.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2011-12-13,"Hello, Greta.
Well, the Republicans were very worried that I was going to run as an independent. They were afraid to go into the debate, other than, of course, Newt Gingrich, who showed great courage, and Rick Santorum. So they were afraid to go into the debate. They were sort of being led by a couple of people that said, Well, if Trump runs as an independent, and I'd only do that if they choose somebody that is not to my liking, somebody that would not beat the president, who must be beaten if this country is going to almost survive.
You could use that expression, I really believe. We are in such deep trouble. But the Republicans were very concerned that I would run as an independent. And you know, that's their -- that's their concern and that's their problem.
I don't know that they're afraid. I know they're afraid that I'll run as an independent, and I'll only do that if they pick somebody that I don't think will win or somebody that I don't think would do a good job, which is a possibility.
Well, they didn't want to be in a debate where somebody would be running as an independent sometime into the future. As you know, I have the equal time laws against me because of the show, ""The Apprentice,"" and I'm not allowed to run until around May 20th. After that time, I'm a free agent. I can do what I want.
If I see that the Republicans have picked the wrong candidate or somebody that either won't do a good job or isn't going to beat Obama, then I would be able, after May 20th, to run.
I was very disappointed with Mitt Romney. We have a great relationship. I like him very much. I think he likes me. I was very surprised he didn't do the debate. I think it would have been a great thing for him to do. It would have been fair and tougher than the other debates. I know the issues better than the moderators.
They don't even bring up the important things as do what is happening and what is wrong with our country. So I was very disappointed that Mitt Romney didn't do the debate. I think it would have been a very good thing for him.
I don't think it's safe to assume. I do respect the fact that Newt Gingrich came up and was immediately willing to do the debate. He didn't wait. He was the first one. He said I would love to do the debate. His big thing he wants to beat Obama. He is looking at this audience not just to win the nomination but to beat Obama.
But I haven't made my mind up. I haven't made a decision yet. When I do, I'll let a lot of people -- a lot of people are waiting for me to make the decision because they understand that I see what is going on. I see what is being ripped off by other nations and OPEC, and nobody does anything about it. We are like a trust without a trustee.
We don't have somebody that is confident enough as a president to protect us as a nation.
I think he could. I think President Obama has done such a poor job and divisive job. Class warfare may be the only way he will get re-elected because the country is doing terribly. The real unemployment rate is 21 percent. I had a smile last week when it down you than to 8.6, but 315,000 people gave up and may gave up permanently in trying to get a job, and therefore they don't count.
What kind of numbers charade is this? If you look at the numbers you are probably talking about 21 percent unemployment.
We'll have to see what happens. I'm going to give an endorsement in the not too distant future. As you know, millions of people are waiting for that. And they are not waiting because I am a nice person or waiting for any other reason. They really feel I get it. I watched the Republican debate. They don't even talk about OPEC or very little about China.
And these are very major reasons why our country is doing so badly. They take our jobs in the case of China. They manipulate their currencies. Then they take our money and loan it back to us and we pay them interest. The whole thing is incredible and it could stop so easily if we had somebody at the top who was competent, which we don't.
I think you would have had a tougher debate. I wouldn't spent 15 minutes giving instructions, and then go ad nauseam on and on. It would have been a real debate on the real issues. It would have been a great debate. But I also understand, the RNC Reince Priebus was very, very strong in the fact he thought it may be dangerous for Republicans to go into a debate with somebody that could potentially beat an opponent after May 20th.
It may have been. I don't think it would have been. Even if that was the case, they are going to get their word out. And if they're good at doing it, I don't see how a candidate that is far behind -- you could name any of them. Newt Gingrich right now is way up, but I respect the fact that he has the courage to go out and say immediately I want to do that debate.
It's going to be a hell of a debate. There will be a lot of people watching. I was very disappointed that other people didn't want do it. They are so far behind, what did he have to lose?
Loyalty is very important. But as an example, she is not going to win anyway. I told her, Michele, you are a wonderful woman. Why don't you go home and relax. Michele Bachmann would call me constantly. She came up four times. I didn't want to see her, but out of respect I saw her. She asked me if I'd do a phone call with a lot of people.
We get thousands and thousands of people. I said I'll do it and the call lasted over an hour. Then I said would you do the debate. She says I don't want to do that. It's not relevant because she is not going win anyway, but it was very disloyal. I thought was very disloyal especially in her case because she came up four times.
She called. She talked. And then I get this long lengthy call with thousands of people, and then she says she is not going to do the debate. So that's not a loyal thing. I'm a believer in loyalty. I absolutely am.
Yes.
Governor Romney called me and said very nicely he won't be able to do it. He said his schedule doesn't permit, which is farfetched, I think. If I think he will do the best job, I would endorse him in a minute. It's not because he won't do the debate. I guess you have to get over that psychologically, Greta, but the fact if I think he is the best that will do the best job for the country, I wouldn't hesitate to endorse him.
I will say that I'll be making an endorsement at some point. If that person wins, obviously I'm not going to be running. If the person doesn't win and somebody else, I might depending on who that is.
I think there are a lot of differences. Both have done very well in the debates. Both are doing a very good job. They seem to be leading. It seems inconceivable that somebody is going to come up and nab the position. But I think they are very different styles. They have very interesting styles. I will say it's amazing the way Newt has caught on. He is like a rocket ship.
Mitt Romney is really having a hard time getting in that 20 percent quagmire. For some reason, Herman Cain, who I think is an excellent guy, when he leaves and all those potential voters come up and it comes up in the polls, and you see Romney gets none of them it's really -- I don't understand why. I think he doesn't understand what is going on. He doesn't seem to pick up any momentum.
That is big problem. He has to solve that problem very quickly.
Thank you very much, Greta.
",Interview: Greta Van Susteren Interviews Donald Trump on Fox News' On the Record,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-van-susteren-fox-december-13-2011
Gavin Newsom,United States of America,2020-07-08,"Good afternoon. Today I wanted to take the opportunity to update you on our preparedness plans in the State of California. With the Coronavirus case numbers increasing, with positivity rates increasing in the state, with hospitalization rates and ICU rates increasing in the state of California, I thought it was an opportunity to once again share with you our preparedness plans in this state. Update you on where we’ve been over the course of the last number of months, where we began and what we’re prepared to do to meet the increased number of cases that we are experiencing currently here in the State of California. As many of you recall, when we launched the nation’s first stay at home order on March 19th, its purpose was foundational, was to save lives and to better prepare our healthcare delivery system for an inevitable increase in capacity needs.
And that increase was not only increase in terms of place, meaning identifying the opportunity to provide conditions where we can find physical assets for individuals’ space, but also the appropriate number of people to help support individuals and needs, and of course the appropriate novel personal protective equipment that is foundational and essential to safely providing that care. So as we move forward, on March 19th of this year, we with intention began a process anew to identify those foundational components so that we can meet the needs of those that need to access hospital care and receive high quality care in the State of California. And to look to utilize our existing hospital footprint, the capacity that exists within a hospital setting and within the larger hospital campus setting to build capacity. In addition to that of course, we looked to identify alternative care sites all throughout the State of California. You may recall a few months back, we talked about FMS. These were the federal medical stations that we were able to get from the federal government. We identified locations throughout the State of California to pre-position those FMS sites that provide capacity up to 250 beds to meet the medical needs of the system, to help decompress the hospital system, to provide alternative care sites to meet the needs of patients that either were presymptomatic, asymptomatic or in some instances were not in need of acute care but need of intense medical care that may have been exposed to COVID-19. We identified additional sites throughout the state, including old mothball hospitals, Seton being an example in Northern California. We had identified early on St. Vincent down in LA County. We procured sites that are still under contract in Fairview and Porterville, different parts of the state up here in Sacramento, the old Sleep Train Arena, where now the Sacramento Kings used to play.
Those sites, many of those sites still available to us in what we call warm status, all part and parcel of a larger portfolio to meet the needs as we see an increase in the spread and transmission of COVID-19. Speaking of spread, this slide gives you a sense of what our existing hospital footprint looks like in the State of California. We have 416 hospitals in this state, but one thing you’ll see from the slide is they’re not equally distributed in various parts of the state. Let me give you a specific example. You have roughly plus or minus a few thousand, but roughly 21,000 plus licensed hospital beds in LA as an example. In Sutter County, you have just 14. So depending on where you live, the assets that are available to you are quite distinctive. And you could imagine where you have an increase of just a few patients in your ICUs in Sutter, that can represent a huge percentage of your total capacity. So, so often I make this point in presentations like this, I give you information in the aggregate, but remind you that none of us live in the aggregate.
We live in cities and counties throughout the State of California populated with different density in terms of total number of people, but also different density of assets. And so over the course of the last number of months, we’ve been looking to procure strategies in a very strategic and mindful way of where those deserts of support work, from testing, to tracing and tracking, to addressing the acute care needs as well as meeting the needs more broadly, of communities throughout this remarkably diverse, the nation’s largest and most populous state.
We had a plan when we started in March that had a surge capacity within our hospital system of roughly 20% of that current capacity that we often identify and I’ll give you those numbers in a minute. And those were around the 75,000 hospital capacity number that so often I promoted as a baseline of existing capacity. It’s a little less today and we’ll get to that in a moment. We had no established alternative care sites, meaning we didn’t have the FMS identified, we didn’t have these alternative leases and sites already procured and established. We were just in the process in March of identifying if Seton would be interested in engaging a contract with the state, working with the legislature to procure resources beyond just emergency resources, to establish a longer term framework of support. We did not have pre-positioned medical assets of any type and including PPE which I’ll get to as well in a subsequent slide.
Today in July fast forward, we now have capacity to treat 50,000 COVID-19 patients, well beyond that surge capacity at 20%. We have as I said, built out these alternative care sites, the physical sites, we have secured hospitals like Seton and we have pre-positioned a lot of these medical assets. So it’s FMS sites throughout the State of California in areas that were vulnerable to surges and spikes in COVID-19. We also focus not just on the physical, as I said it’s place, space, people. This slide represents people. We started something called California Health Corps. It exceeded all expectations. We quite literally had no expectation that if more than a few thousand people may avail themselves with a valid license and provide information about their professional capacity to sort of meet needs based upon a matching criteria and protocol that began to take shape in terms of needs for LVNs and RNs and respiratory specialists and the like over the course of the last number of months. We’ve been re scrubbing that site, over 96,000 people went to that site, filled out the initial application, but about 35,000 of those applications have valid licenses for professional needs.
It’s important to note, we haven’t updated this in some time. We have been able already to deploy. We haven’t needed all these books. We’ve just identified these folks but we did find the need for 741 professionals that helped us with some of our skilled nursing facilities, our adult daycare facilities. They’re actually helping us currently with our corrections facilities and providing staffing and expertise and as well, providing alternative care facility personnel support. So that system, the development of this site, California Health Corps site, which by the way if you are a professional, you may have retired recently, you may be interested in being supportive as we’ve seen these numbers increase. I’d encourage you to go to the covid19.ca.gov website to fill out an application as well. Again, we don’t want everybody concentrated filling out applications just in one part of the state.
It’s really about matching need in different parts of the state based upon different professions within the healthcare system. And so you may have a unique experience, unique perspective, a unique license in part of the state that’s significantly underserved. You’re exactly the kind of person, we would encourage you to go to that site, fill out the application, provide your license information and we’ll make sure over the course of the next number of days and weeks to get back and contact you. That staffing capacity was one part of it. And again, procuring sites, places, beds to put people, staff, those beds was important, but inventory was important, PPE, something that we’re all familiar with and needs to do more on getting surgical masks and procedure masks and gloves and gowns and face shields and coveralls in many different areas of need within PPE. The most important though being those masks that we needed. And just look at this slide, you’ll see in March of this year when we began we had roughly one million masks in inventory. Wholly inadequate in March to meet the needs of this pandemic.
We were fortunate and I’ve acknowledged this on multiple occasions and I want to just do it again. Governor Schwarzenegger had years prior procured a large cache of N95 masks. Many of them had expired but we worked with the FDA and others, CDC to be able to utilize a lot of those masks so we were fortunate to have 21 million N95 masks. I don’t know another state was benefited from that kind of supply.
But as we quickly learned, 21 million masks may sound like a lot, but it turned out to be a very modest number. And as a consequence, we had a huge backlog and a need to go bold and to go big in terms of procurement. And it’s exactly what we did. It’s what we said we were going to do and we’re able to deliver. Just one contract, we were able to bring down 189 million new procedure masks, 72 million N95 masks just from one contract that got a lot of attention and I don’t think enough attention got to the fact that we were able to deliver on the commitments we made over a two month period to draw down those masks. As a consequence of that, you’ll see on this slide, we’ve been able to, with that contract and others, we were able to put together, distribute 200 additional million procedure mass beyond what we had in inventory. You see that slide 201 million procedure masks we’ve distributed just in the last four months. 79 million N95 masks we were able to distribute.
So today rather than being in a position where we were, one million procedure masks and just 21 million N95 masks, today we have in inventory as of this morning, 232 million additional procedure masks beyond what we’ve already distributed, the center slide there and 46 million N95 masks. We’re still in the process of procuring more masks but we’ve never been better positioned, so much so, full disclosure that we’ve been able to distribute masks to four other states to help with their needs. And that’s something in partnership with FEMA who has been just extraordinary in helping us with this procurement, is something that we designed with our original contracts, that we would have the kind of agreement once we hit a certain threshold and we’re able to make the distributions that we’ve made, that we can help support other states. They’re reimbursing us a hundred percent of those costs but again, we only distribute those when we can meet the needs within state. We recognize that we still have a lot more work to do beyond just the N95 masks and procedure masks.
None of us are naive about that and we are sending out millions of masks every single week and I recognize there are still parts of the state that are deserving and in need of additional PPE and we recognize the urgency in terms of the distribution of the same. But I am very pleased with the urgency that has been demonstrable in the development of our protocols, our procedures, and our plans with our partnership that we’ve created with California Hospital Association in particular. We’ve had incredible support from the California nurses and other labor organizations like SEIU. I just want to compliment them on their heroic efforts and maintaining their status as our frontline heroes in this pandemic. And let us not forget the nurses and others that are on the front lines every single day. I’m putting up numbers. They’re the human face of this pandemic doing everything they can to meet the needs of those that are coming into the hospitals, now at record numbers and meeting the needs of patients that are coming in with symptoms, even some presymptomatic and asymptomatic that have to have their needs met.
But the hospital system had a lot of work to do. And that work was led by outstanding leader that is here, the Head of the California Hospital Association, to talk about exactly what the system, the surge capacity looks like and how we’ve been able to develop an essence of a mutual aid system of sorts, which will explain some of what you’ve been perhaps reading about. why folks in Imperial County, where we’ve had to decompress our system by over 500 patients. Why we have protocols and processes of where to send those patients when we move them out of county, that we know that we have agreements in for example, San Diego County, in LA County, including here in Northern California where a few of the patients went up to-
Northern California, where a few of the patients went up to UCSF in San Francisco and other parts of the state. So it’s a remarkably dynamic system and no person better able to explain that system than the head of that system, Carmela Coyle who’s here. And I’m very grateful again for her partnership, her seriousness of purpose, her leadership. And, I just can’t thank her enough more publicly than I have in the past, but I need to repeat it yet again, because we’re all being put to the test, particularly our hospital system at this moment. And so I want to give her the privilege of this opportunity to engage with all of you and explain a little bit more comprehensively what that surge plan looks like. And while they feel some confidence in the immediate term, in terms of our ability to meet the needs of patients that are coming into our hospital system, Carmela?
Thank you. And as you can see, we have an outstanding partner and developed incredible partnerships at a regional level local level, but statewide. And the partnership is a dynamic and it’s demonstrable, not only in terms of the planning documents, but the actualization of our efforts that have been tested in certain parts of the state over the course of the last number of weeks. I want to just note, in addition to what we have, as it relates to our hospital capacity. I mentioned these alternative care sites. We were fortunate, I had a conversation with the vice president just a few days ago, to be able to draw down even more support than we had in the past for these field medical teams, we’re going to get 190 individuals that are coming from HHS from our federal partners to come in and help to relieve some of the stress for some of our caregivers and Carmela was saying, appropriately, not just the nurses, but also our doctors.
I want to acknowledge by the way, the California Medical Association, they had sent doctors, they had sent a team of folks to New York during the peak of the pandemic and the challenges they were experience, and not only to provide support and assistance, but they also got valuable experience that we’re able to take back from that time in the state, and being able to share that information with other caregivers and providers, all of these are reasons in addition to what you just heard as it relates to therapeutics that are coming in, Remdesivir, in the fact that we got received our first inventory of Remdesivir, one of the more promising therapeutics, but also began the process of distributing that to our local providers. All of these, again, are additional points that allow us more confidence in our capacity to meet need and to address our surge.
So 1,929 warm beds, only a handful of those beds are currently being utilized in our alternative care sites, distributed throughout the state of California. And we’ll continue to keep those within a 72 hour prism of being made operational, which is a guideline for what it’s worth, we have established to allow us to move. If indeed, we see some additional stresses outside of our surge plans, and our capacity that we have built within our hospital system. Again, we’re doing this because we’re seeing hospitalization rates grow as, well, I just said it’s because people are not wearing their masks. People are not for many different reasons, and many different circumstances practicing the physical distancing that they should. And they must in order to mitigate the spread of this virus, we’re seeing increased mixing within households. We’ve said that on many different occasions, you’re hearing that at the local level, you’re hearing that across this country as well, governors in other states making the same point, so often is the case, you have members, your extended family of neighbors from outside your household.
We take our guard down a little bit and we’re seeing at least based upon the feedback we’re getting from our county health experts that is one dominant area of concern. Obviously a consistent area of concern from day one, outside our skilled nursing facilities, our veterans facilities, and our congregate homeless facilities is around our jail system and our state system. So prisons, and jails, we are monitoring. Good news is we saw a modest about 400 less identified positive COVID positive patients in our CDCR state federal system than we had even on Monday. But there are parts of the system, San Quentin, substantively, but still others in Chino that we are monitoring up in, up in Lassen County, and some others that we are monitoring where we’re seeing intense outbreaks, and obviously that’s impacting some of the hospitalization rates in those communities and around those communities.
And as always, and I neglected this, there was, I thought a wonderful question was asked of me on Monday about why we’re seeing an increase in hospitalizations. I talked about the young, and the invincibles, and you are seeing this across the United States, younger people that just feel like they are invincible, and that they’re not going to, even if they get COVID-19 that the symptoms will be so modest that it won’t typically impact them. Well, we’re seeing the hospitalization rates that we’re seeing some younger patients, but we’re also mindful that it’s not just the young invincibles, it’s not just those that are increasing mixing outside of households. And those that are not practicing physical distancing as they should wearing masks as they must, but we’re also seeing our essential workforce. And I just want to acknowledge that there’s a little bit of mythology about reopening the economy.
It’s important to note 60 plus percent of the economy never shut down in California. So we talked about the stay at home order on March 19th, 60 plus percent of the economy was still fully operational, at least operationalized in a modified sense, meaning was moving forward. And a lot of those essential workers put their lives, their health, quite literally on the line. These are the food workers, these are farm workers. These are the folks in the grocery stores, and others. And a lot of these are young, tend to be some cases, younger individuals, a lot of them that truly represent the diversity in the state of California that became very vulnerable to the spread of this virus and continue to be vulnerable to the spread of this virus. So I just want to acknowledge that essential workforce overrepresented in the black and brown community for being there when we needed them the most.
And it’s incumbent upon us as we meet the needs of this surge and the broader community in the state, and our nation, the world, we’re trying to collectively build that we are mindful of these essential workers and have their best interests at heart as we move forward. As we do move forward, and we’ve said the hospitalizations are increasing. You heard a statistic that represented from yesterday. Interestingly, the new number we just got in a few hours ago, which Carmela didn’t even have the privilege of having, which we’re just putting out publicly shows a 44% increase in hospitalizations over the last two week period. So you’re seeing the total number of hospitalized increasing to 6,100, again, that represents a 44% increase over a two week period, total capacity, and this is a side, you become familiar with our system still around 8% COVID-19 identified positive patients in terms of the total number of licensed hospital beds in the system.
So it gives again a relative sense of total healthcare, licensed bed capacity, and percentage of those that we have identified as COVID positive. ICU admissions, again, you see the hospital rates go up, you’re going to see the ICU admissions likely to increase all as lagging indicators. We’re seeing ICU admissions increase over the course of a two week period in this new data set that’s coming out today at 34%, 44% increase in the hospitalizations over two week period, 34% represented in the number, 1,753, that are currently admitted into our ICUs. Our ICU capacity with that cohort of 1,753 COVID positive patients represents in terms of the total number of ICU and NICU beds in our state, roughly 15% of the population, we still have maintained, and by the way, this is demonstrably of because of the work the hospital association’s done, not the state, mostly the hospital association, they’ve been active in securing PPP, active in securing more ventilators.
We are as well, as a state, but because of their outstanding work, we have still 11,300 ventilators available just within their capacity within their system that are currently not being utilized. And so that gives you a sense of the numbers. Speaking of numbers, this number should draw some attention, and that is one of the largest single day cohort number of positive cases that we’ve reported since the beginning of this pandemic. So, I want to caution you for purposes of full disclosure before the press respectfully runs with that number. I hope you responsibly will condition a recognition of the note that we put on this slide, that the number includes a backlog of reported numbers that we’re still working through with LA County. We had mentioned that on Monday, there was a bit of a backlog. There is a cohort that would actually bring this number below 10,000.
That’s represented in the number we’re presenting here today. And so I hope as we run with that number, we’re cautious and are being fully informative to the public. That that number does include a backlog of some LA County numbers. So, I think a way to really start to express this, and we began to do this on terms of total number of cases, to talk about positivity rates, what I really want to emphasize, and I think this is important for all of us as individuals and as members that are responsible, and all of us accountable for distributing information to the public. To really focus on the seven day average, and you can see the seven day average. And this number is reflective of that backlog reflective of a contemporary assessment of our daily numbers that we collect 8,116 individuals have tested positive over a seven day period.
The last cohort that I provided a rather seven day average that I provided was 7,867. 7,876, forgive me, my dyslexia is coming through. 7,876. That was on Monday was a seven day average, you see, it’s increasing just two days later, 8,116. Let’s take a closer look at some of these numbers as we do on a daily basis. We are now averaging over 106,000 tests per day. Over the last seven days, just shy of 100,000 yesterday, we got up to as high as 127,000 tests on Saturday. So, we’re making good on our promise to in-
On Saturday. So, we’re making good on our promise to increase testing. Remember where we were just, I think it was 90 or so days ago. In fact, in April, we were testing about 2000 people a day. I’ll repeat that. We were testing 2000 people a day. We decided to do a reset, put together a task force led by Dr. Charity Dean and by Paul Markovich of Blue Shield. They delivered on what we had promoted and what they promised, and we have now exceeded the goals that we had established. I will say, these all are goals and goals have to be re-imagined, and I think we have to realign some of our goals and we’ll be talking more about that I think maybe as early as Friday, as late as Monday. I’ll talk about our next iteration on testing and how we’re going to be much more strategic, much more dynamic in our testing. Much smarter, dare I say, peril in terms of who we’re targeting in terms of testing and how deep we’re going in testing people on a more consistent basis.
So, it’s not just about the numbers. We can get caught up in just the aggregate, the numbers, but it’s how we’re testing, where we’re testing, and we’re all recognizing a current stress. You’re seeing some articles about this, some attention, which is good, and it’s certainly consistent with our experience over the last few weeks. As you’ve seen an increase, even at a greater rate, we’re looking at a 7.1% positivity rate reflected in this slide over the 14-day period. You’re seeing a doubling, sometimes tripling, of a positivity rate in some other states compared to California. By the way, I’m not pleased with a 7.1% positivity rate. That has gone up and I’m going to show you a slide in a moment that underscores the concern, but in other states, that positivity rate is substantially even higher.
As a consequence, testing is increasing. Testing supply constraints are starting to present themselves again. And some concerns about accessing the golden oldies of reagents and some of the transport media and swabs and the like. So, we’re working through all of those issues, and we’ll be announcing a reconstituted taskforce with new goals, new specific strategies to address our needs as we move forward. But again, I cannot impress upon you more how impressed I have been of that task force delivering on that goal, which stretch goal was 80,000. 60,000 was a baseline, 80,000 on a daily basis. They’ve exceeded that over 100,000 now averaged over a seven-day period.
Positivity rate continues to climb. Let me give you this slide as you’ve seen it often. This positivity rate shows you a cohort of positivity rates that we put together over a 14-day period. This represents an increase of roughly 39% over a two-week period and total positivity rates. So, that’s a concern. I’ve made this point before. I’ll make it today. Every decimal point is a point of concern, and I cannot emphasize more a point of consideration for all of us, that we have the capacity to move that number down by our individual behavior, by wearing masks, by practicing the hand washing and physical distancing and social distancing that’s required of all of us at this moment.
At peril, that 7% can spike and quickly into the double digits and you’ve seen in other states even into the 20 plus percent range. So, we’re monitoring this very closely and all of us should monitor on behavior accordingly, even more closely in order to mitigate the spread and the transmission of this disease. Speaking of spread and transmission, we have been transparent in terms of providing a list to you on a consistent basis of counties that we’re monitoring on a list. Some refer to it as a watch list. More formally, we refer to it as a monitoring list. These are counties that put out attestations that attested to containment plans and procurement plans in terms of their own strategies to procure assets and resources, human resources, physical assets, to meet the needs of their communities, their particular counties, and their particular and unique circumstances.
Today, we’re adding three new counties to the monitoring list for a total of 26. A week or so ago, we had 19 counties on the list. 23 counties when I was with you on Saturday. 26 now with Napa, San Benito, and Yolo County on the list. Remember, the monitoring list then requires some modifications to the stay-at-home orders, the modifications and sectors that require a lot of indoor activities to be brought outdoors, and I want to just acknowledge that a number of these counties didn’t come kicking and screaming. In fact, reached out to us in anticipation that were likely to enter onto the list, and we are very proactively working with them, have been, and engaging them on making sure that we’re all working together on the technical assistance and helping them support and prepare for the modifications in their counties. Accordingly, just to reinforce that, you’ll see that we’ve had 18 counties already move forward with their own locally issued orders. Four have just submitted to the state orders and four are awaiting action. Three of them we’re just announcing today, Colusa that I anticipate will move very quickly. So, I just want to thank again, these counties. The partnership is really demonstrably. I know there was some flare up and some consternation a few months ago, and people had their own ideas about pacing and their own considerations, but the overwhelming majority now of counties are just conducting themselves as we would all hope.
I’m very, very pleased and proud of that and very thankful. I just would be remiss if I did not acknowledge their local health officers, their city administrators, their County board of supervisors, for their patience and their assertiveness, as we move into this new phase and try to mitigate and tame the spread and transmission of this disease. As always, the best way to do that is to wear that mask. Wash your hands, simple hand hygiene, and making sure that all of us are taking very, very seriously this moment. I cannot impress upon people before I open up to questions, the potency of your individual decision making. I just want to underscore the potency of that because we had 111 lives lost in the last reporting period.
111 lives lost. Again, sort of breaking a little of the mythology, why we’re seeing mortality rates that have declined. That masks, forgive the pun, the reality still of hundreds of people across this country dying on a daily basis of this disease. 111 here just in the state of California alone. Lives lost, families destroyed, torn asunder, loved ones that will never return. So, I hope all of us are sober about that and cognizant of the moment we’re in and the vulnerability that everybody has at this moment. This moment will pass. We will get through this. We will become more resilient as a state, as a nation. I would argue, globally as a world. We will. There’s no question in my mind about that. The question is when, and that determines the basis on the determination of how we conduct ourselves, how we behave, goes to the question of how do we safely reopen our schools and when do we reopen.
In many respects, that’s determined on our behavior and what we do over the course of the next few weeks to mitigate growth and spread and the transmission of this disease. Data makes those determinations. Data and science make those decisions. Fundamentally, that’s what’s guided us into that March 19th stay at home to making the first subsets of modifications on May 8th, as it relates to the modifications of the stay at home, and now working with these 26 counties to monitor and put that dimmer switch, as we’ve referred to it, back in play to address and mitigate some of the sectoral guidelines that we’ve put out and address the concerns around these spreads, mitigate the growth of the spread of this disease in counties and communities, large and small.
So, forgive the long-windedness of today’s presentation, but I wanted to give you an assurance that the last four months have been meaningful and intentional, and we have done an enormous amount to prepare and presenting you today, I hope you feel a sense of that preparedness to meet your needs, to meet your neighbors’ needs, your community’s needs, the state needs, and to do so head on. But again, we need your compliance. We need your support on wearing these masks. If you’re a senior, if you have these preexisting conditions, if you are vulnerable to this virus and in that category, we cannot impress upon you more to take very, very seriously this moment and do what you can to stay home except for essential purposes and essential needs. So, with that, of course, now happy to answer any questions.
Hundreds that you saw on that slide. You’ll see the threshold in numerical terms, quite detailed terms, of the detailed list capacity. The state has hundreds and hundreds of millions of masks. When we made the agreement for a large procurement, which many of you have written about, I hope you’ll consider the fact that that procurement prevailed in 72,000,095 masks. Just one contract. Wasn’t the only contract over 189 million of our procedure masks. We were able to do that in a very short period of time, a concentrated period, just over a 60-day or so period plus or minus. We were able to procure that. I don’t know another state in the country was able to procure at that scale. Part of the agreement in partnership with our federal partners, particularly FEMA, was a consideration of need to those most in need.
We did that with ventilators. We’re part of the human condition. We are one of many states. We feel very connected to the American spirit that must meet this moment and the needs of our brothers in sisters and other states. So, I mentioned a few weeks back the number of 17 million. That’s more specific to your question. I mentioned that on a number of occasions, including one state where we had sent, and I think everybody would understand why, and that’s Arizona masks. We’ve also done it in Alaska, Oregon, Washington, and we’re looking to do more as necessary, but we must always in the threshold in terms of the question, we must also as a primer, as a foundational principle, meet the needs within the state. That is precisely what we’ve been doing over the last number of weeks as these new supplies have come in. You saw that in the amount of masks that we have distributed, including, by the way, two months’ supply into our public-school system.
We mentioned this last Friday. 35 million masks to the California Grocers Association, the Restaurant Association, working in partnership with CMTA, which is the California Manufacturing Trade Association that also is helping sectorally reopen the economy safely and how we’re partnering with them on the distribution of masks. Our first priority, of course, are our frontline men and women in the hospital system. By the way, hospital systems procuring, as I mentioned a moment ago, their own PPE in addition to what the state’s doing. So, we’re trying to supplement that, find gaps, farm workers and the like and seasonal farm workers coming in. So, we feel at the moment we are meeting the needs, but as I said a moment ago, we’re getting these out in real time. So, the orders are coming in and we can’t get these masks out quickly enough. So, we’re putting together a spreadsheet where we think we need to be, and all I can assure you is we’re continuing to procure even more masks. We’re not going to sit back statically and allow that stockpile to deplete so we’re back to where we were in March.
Well, we’ve tried to encourage testing, particularly in our diverse communities. We’ve been able to put up a site, and this is my opportunity to remind you and allow you to avail yourself to accessing the site COVID-19. Ca.gov, COVID-19.ca.gov. You can type in your zip code, and we will provide information about the availability of testing sites that are approximate to where you live, and also the reimbursement or costs associated. A vast majority of these, there is no cost associated with getting a test. As I said, either on Friday or as late as Monday, I’ll be putting out a different frame of engagement on the testing that will go more substantively and specifically to your question, because we are now looking to really target and modify our testing criteria in a much more strategic way.
We actually put a little guidance out on Sunday. I don’t know that you had a chance to take a look at that. I encourage you to take a look at it. It’s on that same site. That gives you a sense of a preview of where we’re going with our new testing protocols in terms of really targeting most vulnerable members of our community, most diverse parts of the state, and still addressing some main existing testing deserts that we have to address in the state, and obviously, the supply concerns that I mentioned a moment ago.
Look, as it relates to why we think the hospitalization rates are up, you saw that slide. Those are the four areas that our experts, the health officials that we’re engaging, our own health officials, our hospital partners, those are the areas where they suggest most of the activity is occurring in terms of the cause and effect of why people are ending up in the hospitals.
Those vectors or super spreaders, spreaders, however, you may want to define them, we’ve defined those four categories as areas of most concern. I will say, full disclosure, if you look more granularly and I’ve brought this up on many previous occasions, so I didn’t feel the need to do it again today, you’ll see regional considerations. Imperial, we’ve talked about a lot of people, dual-citizenship, cross border activity down in Imperial. That’s also an issue, so there are many other micro factors, but in the macro, those are the four carat areas where we think are the most contributory in terms of the increases that we’re experiencing.
Yeah. I’ve visited San Quentin on many, many occasions.
Yeah. I’ve visited San Quentin on many, many occasions on a daily basis, including right after this press conference we’ll be reviewing additional releases. So the answer to your question is an affirmative. We’ve been able to decompress that, it feels like at the hospital now, but that prison from that number, which I’ve mentioned on Monday, mentioned previous week, 4,051 prisoners on March 1st, the goal is to get it down to 3000. It looks like as of today, this morning, we think we have a plan in the next few weeks to bring the population down to 3076. So from 131% capacity where we were just a few months ago and now getting it down below that 100% capacity threshold. We still want to do more than that so that we could provide more co-horting, more isolation of inmates. Course, we have staff concerns as well. We’re using the chapel and the gyms differently. We have now our FMS, mentioned FMS as relates to alternative care sites. We actually moved one of our FMS sites to San Quentin proper. I visited Vacaville Prison yesterday where we’re doing the same there in a very proactive way, and had the privilege of being with the federal receiver or the judge, or other rather, not the federal receiver, but federal judge that has been doing a wonderful job trying to address the needs of our entire system. And so I am very, very grateful to his leadership. We were there with the acting warden, for his leadership, Vacaville, and was there with many of the leaders within CDCR to get a first hand sense of what’s going on. But I’ve not been just visiting the prisons recently. I’ve been doing that on a consistent basis. Been a cause if you’ve been following me for decades, a big cause of the why, when one answer is why do you want to do certain things in life? Criminal justice reform has been a big part of that. So this weighs very heavily on all of us and me. And as I said, there has not been a day in the last few weeks where we’re not working individual by individual to try to address the needs at San Quentin, and more broadly Chino and other parts of the system that we have responsibility to address as well.
Yeah. I’m not worried about the latest tweets, and I could give you ad nauseum examples of why I’ve concluded that that’s not the issue that we need to address. What we need to address is safely reopening the schools, and we need to make that a foundational principle. That to me is non-negotiable. We have to safely reopen our schools and we also have to reconcile what is also non-negotiable, and that is we must insist upon learning the beginning of the school year. We provided, as I mentioned a moment ago, two months of PPE. We are procuring more PPE to provide even more support for our educational system, not just K through 12, but our preschools and obviously our system of higher education as well to help support their efforts. That’s why we have to continue to do more on face shields, masks, gloves, and gowns, and the like, deep sanitation and other procurement, which is foundational in terms of safely reopening the schools.
Number two, we put together statutory language in our budget that incentivizes the kind of learning that we think is more advantageous, which is in-person learning. But we also provided flexibility in our statutory language in the approved budget. By the way, that includes $5 billion for learning loss and safely reopening the school system support that we were able to draw down from the federal government already. So I think that’s an important point to note. And we are providing the flexibility based upon local conditions. I know it sounds almost like a mantra, but it’s foundational. In a state, again, as large as California. 1000 plus school districts, conditions are unique and distinctive classrooms, physical classrooms are such where you can’t have the physical distancing that you can in other classroom environments in different parts of the state. All of these things need to be managed the local level with the foundational framework of keeping our kids, and as you suggest, Jeremy, our teachers healthy and safe.
And yes, I fear that more than I fear a tweet. I fear that as a foundational principle of responsibility to protect our caregivers, our teachers, to protect their support staff, janitors, the bus drivers and our children, and obviously we have a lot of work to do as a society to mitigate the spread of this disease. That will be foundational in terms of making a data informed decision on how to safely reopen our schools. But foundationally, we need to acquire learning and that has to occur, and so we are working very closely with our partners. We put out guidelines on June 5th laying out our specific strategies. We’ve been modifying that and working with our partners, Superintendent of Public Education, many others, and we’ll be seeing a lot more on this topic over the course of the next days and weeks.
Yeah. So I sort of repeat a little bit of what I’m saying. I said a moment ago, in terms of the decision will be based on the data based upon where we are in a number of weeks. We’re not bystanders in that respect. We are agents of our own lives and our own decisions. So foundationally that answer can be affirmative, meaning we can just roll over and accept the spread and transmission, continue with the behaviors that have led to this transmission and this increase, or we can do more to practice the kind of personal responsibility as it relates to wearing face coverings and masks and physically distance from others that will mitigate the spread, will shift that trend line, and avail ourselves to more flexibility and more opportunity. I would like to think that we have the capacity to make better decisions the next few weeks so we don’t have to make the decision to delay a school year.
But we have, and this is why I referenced the previous response, the question, provided flexibility, statutoral language, provided local flexibility on distance learning, hybrid learning and looking at a prioritization always of in-person learning, which goes to issues of social, emotional development, not just intellectual academic development, which we place a great deal of emphasis on. So again, this is work in progress, all to be determined, and we are working very, very collaboratively with our partners all across the state in this dynamic.
No. We don’t have any data on that basis because we’re looking to bend and we’re looking to mitigate the spread and transmission of this virus to be in a very different place before the schools begin to reopen. And so we’re hoping that we have real impact in the next few weeks so that we can mitigate these trend lines and not just accept those trend lines to be then factored in just some numerical expectation in terms of spread within the school system.
That said, this relates to testing and we agree with you, and that’s exactly why I’ve been previewing, on Monday I previewed, it’s why I’m previewing again, the work that is ongoing that various certively is ongoing. We were able to do what we said we were able to do and actually exceed expectations including the last seven days, over a hundred plus thousand tests.
So it’s an interesting moment. You’re right. There’s some supply chain concerns, at the same time, we’re doing record number of tests. But again, that masks some of the nuance of where there are supply challenges, and as well, the challenge we are all having now with the time to getting that testing information back. We were within a couple of days. We started, remember it was six, seven days, and some people, 11, 14 days. We again got it down a few days and we were really making progress as a nation, not just as a state, and now you’re starting to see because the backlogs with Quest and others, that we’re experiencing multi-day delays.
That said, and you’re going to forgive me. I don’t’ want to get too far ahead of our announcement, but let me give you a little more of a preview of it. We’re working to match some of our testing capacity with local labs, with many of our hospitals and not just doing these national labs where you’re seeing a lot of the delays occurring.
We’re also, and it goes to the previous question, around San Quentin just as an example, where we’re using Quest at San Quentin. We had a lot of delays. We’re now working increasingly specifically with Biohub, partnership with UCSF, CG’s foundation, and we’re doing more dynamic testing with much quicker results. So that gives you an indication of sort of the specificity to which we’ll begin to answer that question with much more dynamic strategies for testing to get that response time diminished substantially.
Look, if you have symptoms, if you’re in a high risk category, you’re in a congregate setting and the like, we want to encourage you to get tested, not be discouraged in some cases by some of these delays. We think that’s foundational and fundamental. And so please don’t be dissuaded by that. Know that we have a team working overtime on this, and we’ll, like we did last time when we went from 2000 tests over 100,000 tests, we’ll work our way through this final point.
We have also been very engaged with FEMA in terms of the supply question and are getting a kind of response we were hopeful for, including from the Vice President himself who recognizes the opportunity and responsibility to help support states like ours with some of those supply constraints and some of these backlogs as well.
So thank you all for the opportunity as always, privilege of your time. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to update you. Look forward to making subsequent updates. We’ll be back tomorrow and look forward to answering more questions. And moreover, just encourage you to do the kinds of things that are foundational and fundamental at this moment, and that begins with wearing these masks, and physically distancing, and washing your hands as often as you possibly can. Take care, everybody. We’ll see you tomorrow.
",California Governor Gavin Newsom July 8 Press Conference Transcript,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/california-governor-gavin-newsom-july-8-press-conference-transcript
Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-09-15,"Thank you very much. I have really good news for you. I just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane -- they can't get here.
I love it. So they're trying to get here now. They're going to be about 30 minutes late. They called us and said could you wait, I said absolutely not; let's get going, right. Let's get going, New Hampshire.
And just so you understand, New Hampshire has a special place in my heart because this is where I won my first primary, right.
And we are going to stop the heroin and we are going to stop all of the problems that you have because you have them and we're going to stop them, OK.
You're always going to have them, and I mean this, you're always going to have a very special place in my heart. So, new polls have just come out.
And we're leading in many of the battleground states, and we're leading all over the country. The L.A. Times has us six points up nationwide.
On November 8th, New Hampshire can be the state that pushes us over the top.
We're going to win New Hampshire and we're going to win back the White House, and we're going to make America great again, remember that, remember that.
It's going to be a victory for the people, and especially those people who haven't had hope in a long time. That's a lot of people, believe me, that's a lot of great people. That means cities like Flint, Michigan -- I was there yesterday. In 1970, Flint had over 80,000 residents working at the General Motors plant, 80,000. Today it's less than 8,000 people and heading south, believe me.
Forty percent of the city lives in poverty and now Ford, think of it, Ford, you read about it today. Ford has just announced they're moving all small car productions, small car, the little ones, you know, but they're pretty big. They're probably moving all production, they just don't want to say it, eventually -- I was right, I was right. I've been saying this was going to happen for years, to Michigan, to Ohio, to every place that makes cars and it's getting worse and worse.
Well they're moving to Mexico on top of all the other car production that they've moved there and that other companies have moved there. This is -- we are creating the car capital of the world in Mexico, believe me folks. And I'm going to make sure that ends if I'm elected. It's going to end, end.
So I went to Flint yesterday, to address the water crisis. It's a failure at every single level of government. It's tragic, and it's heartbreaking, and should never happen in the United States of America, ever. It used to be, cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. That's what's happening to our country, see that's what's happening to our country.
This is what happens when we build up other countries instead of our own, we lose control. It's time to take care of our people and our workers.
I'm campaigning in every community, and if you think this is easy, it's not. I've been all over the place. Wall Street, you know if you would've looked today, all over, including Waldorf Astoria today, we made a big speech on the economy, etc. and I go from there to another place to here. And I love doing it because what we're doing is a movement. What we're doing, you're going to be so proud of your country very, soon so just remember, so proud.
And it is a movement and it's a movement that everybody is talking about, everybody is talking about it. I'm running to be the President of all Americans. Our support comes from all regions and backgrounds and all walks of life. You are the cops and soldiers, the carpenters and welders, the accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white, Latino, but above all, we're all Americans, all of us together, all are Americans.
While Hillary Clinton...
... slanders you as the deplorable and irredeemable -- that means you can't ever get better, she doesn't understand you. I call you hard-working American patriots who love your family and love your country.
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal laws, Secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.
It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created all over the world, in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran, all over. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS -- that's what happened, bad decisions.
She has bad judgment. Bernie Sanders told us that. Obviously, Bernie, you know a rigged system with the superdelegates and Bernie is right now home watching us together.
But in all fairness Bernie Sanders said she suffers from bad judgment, he's right. Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home, so many places.
I am running to reverse these failures and to create a new American future, and there will be. And that future begins with prosperity at home. My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.
Our jobs have been taken away from us -- they've gone to Mexico and they've gone all over the world but they've been taken away by incompetent politicians that don't know what's happening, or politicians that do know what's happening, but they're being bossed by special interests, they have donors, you know what's happening.
My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep shrinking, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before, and there's no reason why it shouldn't be able to grow even better. Everything that is broken today can be fixed. And every failure can be turned into a great, great success, it's going to happen.
And by the way, I just see offstage a very special person. Has anyone ever heard of Eric Trump.
Eric, come up Eric, my son Eric Trump. He is working, and Ivanka and Don and Tiffany, all of them, they are working.
Thank you, Eric. He has been working hard. His sister too, and his brother Don and Tiffany made a great speech, and Melania made a great speech -- everybody, they're working so hard. And boy the press likes to hit them, right, boy the press likes to hit them. And they're such good kids but they can take it -- Eric, can you take it? I think so right. They're good kids.
It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words and start dreaming about the great things we can achieve together as a country. Jobs can stop leaving our country and start pouring in. We're going to take them in, no longer a one-way highway into oblivion.
Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner-cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities. All of these things and so much more are possible. We have such potential in this country.
But to accomplish them we must replace the present policy of globalism, which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country and replace it with a new policy of Americanism, that's what it is, Americanism.
I am not running to be the President of the world.
I am running to be the President of the United States of America.
Thank you. And I am spending a lot of my money doing this I want to tell you. These other people, it's all donations, let the money pour in, we're spending a lot. You better make sure I win on November 8th because I'm going to have wasted a hell of a lot of time, energy and money.
You know when they tell me, Mr. Trump it doesn't matter what you've accomplished. First of all, I've accomplished nothing, you've accomplished, I'm the messenger. But what you've accomplished is so incredible, I say unless we win we've accomplished nothing, just remember. We have to win on November 8th, we have to get there, get everybody, New Hampshire, gotta vote. It's time to replace our failed political system with a new American system. If we lower our taxes, which we're going to do bigly, remove destructive regulations and we will be chopping, unleash the vast treasure of American energy and negotiate trade deals that put America first, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, to hire, to grow and to create new jobs, new technologies and entire new industries, America, America.
Made in America, remember? He remembers. Some of my older folks here right. We know, made in America, you remember? You don't see that very often and you're seeing it less and less, we're gonna bring it back, made in America.
My first day in office I'm going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.
All the needless job killing regulations will be canceled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in. We're going to lift the restrictions on American energy which means lower electricity prices and half a million new jobs a year, big stuff. And that's just the beginning.
Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
It's a disaster. This will instantly save another two million jobs. I'm also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to re-negotiate the worst trade deal ever made in the history -- not of our country -- in the history of the world, NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, a disaster.
We're going to stand up to China and keep America out of TPP, that's another disaster. We don't need another massive, multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down and is so complicated that nobody in our country understands it. Other countries, they know every word. They know every sentence, every paragraph. Our people, they don't even read deals. They sign whatever is put in front of them. Just take a look at what happened with Obamacare. Practically nobody in Congress read it and what a mess we have.
New Hampshire has lost nearly one in three -- think of it -- one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and one in four since China joined the World Trade Organization, both Hillary Clinton backed disasters, bad judgment, remember, bad judgment. And I'm going to appoint the best and toughest trade negotiators and we have the best in the world. We have the greatest business people and the greatest negotiators in the world. We don't use them, we use political hacks.
We're going to stand up and defend our American workers.
Any deal that doesn't increase jobs and wages in America I will oppose and I mean seriously oppose, not politician oppose. We are going to turn our bad trade deals into great ones.
Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined. -- and by the way we are going to terminate common core and bring education local.
I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his/her choice.
This will help lift millions of poor African American and Hispanic children out of poverty. The poverty in our country is unbelievable.
It's time to break up the failed democratic control over our inner-cities and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation. Our policies on taxes, trade, regulations and educations will grow. Incomes will boost and go right through the roof. We have to increase people's incomes -- do you know that many people in this room made more money 18 years ago in real wages, think of it, than they do now?
They're working harder now, they're older, and many people because of Obamacare and for other reasons, are holding two jobs. So you're getting older, you're working harder and you're making less, I don't think that sounds great.
The only good thing is that I'm also working a hell of a lot harder than I've ever worked before also, so I don't feel so sorry for you, working hard.
But we're enjoying it because we see the fruits of our labor, we see what's happening and in 52 days you're going to have a lot of happy people in this state and in this country, I'll tell you.
So we want to reduce poverty for our African American and Hispanic communities, have to. Since President Obama came into office another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs. We are going to build up your schools and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.
Safety also means protecting our people from radical Islamic terrorism.
My opponent wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees.
You saw what happened yesterday. Hundreds of thousands of people are being approved to pour into the country. We have no idea who they are. What a mistake, the great Trojan horse. Two hundred years from now they'll be saying boy that was a bad, bad couple of years.
You know folks we all have a big heart and we want to build safe havens. We owe $20 trillion very soon, the debt has doubled under Obama but we owe $20 trillion. The gulf states have a lot of money. We're going to get them to put up the money and we'll build it and they have to put up the money. We'll build safe havens, we'll take care of people but we cannot let them come into our country, we just can't, not now.
According to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost our country $400 billion. What are we doing? What are we doing? Instead of providing free health care and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner-cities and help struggling Americans and we should work with Hispanics, we should work with African American citizens and help our inner-cities. And we should take care of our great veterans who are not being treated properly.
They have their priorities so very wrong. I support the construction of safe zones in the region and we will get the gulf states, we're going to get them to pay for it. The gulf states wouldn't be there for very long if it wasn't for us. At the same time -- that's right, keep the oil and remember my statement, you shouldn't go in but if you go in, when you go out, keep the oil. We wouldn't do a thing like that, it's not politically correct right.
At the same time, we will rebuild our military, which is so badly depleted with the greatest people on earth running it. We are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. You know we defend many countries and we're getting socked on that one too, we get socked on everything. Only five of the 28 member NATO countries -- you remember I've been talking about this, they say I don't like NATO, I like NATO. But we are five out of the 28 countries that are paying their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. So don't you think they're supposed to be paying maybe?
I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure that everyone is sharing the security burden and that we are properly focused on protecting our country, and other countries frankly, from radical Islamic terrorism, a word and a phrase that President Obama and Hillary Clinton just refuse to use. And unless you're going to use it and unless you're going to say it, you're never ever going to be able to do anything about it, just remember that.
In all things, it's time to put Americans first and time to start taking care of each other. We have to take care of each other.
And is there any place that's better to be than a Trump rally in New Hampshire, here we are.
No place. There is no place better. And you know what else? There is no place safer.
Earlier this week I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality childcare for their children.
My daughter Ivanka was so helpful. She is so dedicated to that and she has been talking about that long before June 16th of last year when I decided that we have to do this.
On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans. I am going to lower your taxes beyond any number you thought possible.
And by the way, Hillary Clinton is going to raise your taxes very, very substantially.
She is. Very, very substantially.
I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life, it's killing your businesses. I am going to repeal and replace Obamacare. I am going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution.
I am going to rebuild our depleted military and we're going to take care of our vets-- we have plenty of them here tonight.
And the NRA gave us the earliest endorsement they've ever given. So I want to thank the NRA -- these are great people, these are great people. You've got to get out and if you want to save your Second Amendment, believe me, you have to get out and vote.
I am going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall. That's right,
We will. We will build the wall and Mexico will pay for the wall, believe me, they will -- they will.
We have a trade deficit that's so massive with Mexico that the wall is a peanut compared to what we're losing.
But believe me they're going to pay for it. And they'll be happy to do it. It just has to be explained properly.
I am going to so importantly re-negotiate your disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA. Now NAFTA is turning out to be the worst but we're going to re-negotiate and we will make great trade deals and we'll put our American workers first. But here's the thing, if for some reason we can't re-negotiate NAFTA, they could say no, unlikely, but they could say no, we will terminate NAFTA and we'll have new trade deals that will be phenomenal for the United States of America, OK, right.
We're not playing games. And Apple and our other major companies will start making their iPhones, and their computers, and other products inside the United States not in China and all over the world except here, OK? Because that's what's happening right now bigly. We don't make our products anymore in the United States but we will again like never before, mark my words.
We will rebuild our roads, our bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar the skies, and American ships will patrol beautifully the sea.
American steel will send new skyscrapers high into the clouds, American hands will rebuild this nation, and American energy mined from American sources will power our nation.
And believe me when I say this, American workers, right, American workers will be hired to do the job, American workers.
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us together as one American people. Imagine -- just imagine -- what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one flag, right -- saluting -- saluting one flag, right.
It's time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and truly prosperous American future. Jobs will return, incomes will rise and new factories will come back, and they will come back rushing into our shores. It will be a beautiful sight to behold. Once more we will have a government of, by, and for the people.
We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much everybody. November 8th go out and vote.
God bless you, God bless you. Thank you.
","Speech: Donald Trump in Laconia, NH",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-laconia-nh-september-15-2016
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-02-27,"Well, I want to thank you very much. We're here with some of the black leaders of our country and -- people that are highly respected and people that have done a fantastic job and, for the most part, have been working on this whole situation with me right from the beginning. And we've done a lot. We've done Opportunity Zones.
We've done criminal justice reform. We've done things that people didn't even think possible. Criminal justice reform -- we've let a lot of great people out of jail. And, you know, Alice Johnson is, really, just such a great example. A fine woman. And she doesn't say she didn't do it; she made a mistake.
But she was in there for 22 years when we let her out, and she had practically another 20 left. And that's not appropriate.
Yeah, I know. So incredible. And you couldn't produce -- there's nobody is Hollywood that could have produced that last scene of her. That was the real deal -- of her when she saw her kids. So it's really a fantastic thing. So what I think I do is I'd like to -- for the media, I'd like to go around the room, and we can do just a quick introduction of each other.
And I'll start with me. My name is Donald John Trump. And I'm President of the United States.
We have a lot of great things in store and a lot of interesting times. And you've been seeing the polls. The polls have been incredible. We've had some polls with -- and I could say ""black,"" I could say ""African American,"" or I could say both. But I'll tell you what: The polls are at a level that people have never -- I don't think they've seen, in terms of Republican.
And I won't be satisfied until I get 100 percent, because nobody has done more for black people than I have. Nobody has done more. And so, I appreciate it. We've been in this together and what we've accomplished for black people -- for the country, but for black people -- has been unprecedented, I believe.
Terrence? Please.
That's great. He's a great fighter. I didn't see you down there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Jared. Right behind you, I see, through all of these cameras, we have one of our great stars. Will you please stand up?
That's right.
Thank you. And we're doing it. We're doing it.
. And she was there for a long time and was going to be there for a long time. Do you want to mention that?
That's great. No, I'm very happy you told us about it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Jack?
Thank you.
Thank you, David. That's really nice. I actually saw you walking through the airport. You know, I -- it was all over the place; you know, that is a very famous clip. That was great. But I appreciate it, David. Thank you very much. Here's a guy doing a great job.
You knew you could do it. I didn't know -- you knew you could do it. You had no doubt. Great job.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
I will say this: I do lose a fortune being President -- because we're doing very important work. But it is -- and, you know, something I don't talk about but I give my salary -- it's $450,000. I give it. And surprisingly, it -- now, it may be back in George Washington's day, but they don't think any other President has ever given the salary.
It's $450,000.
So, no -- it's money. And I give it. I never had a story -- I don't think I've had a story that I give it. And to be the best of our knowledge, we have not found another President that gave.
But I appreciate what you just said. I appreciate it very much.
Thank you.
Great, huh? You know, my wife, the First Lady, said -- this a long time ago now; it's like four years ago -- she said there are two people that she was watching on the Internet. They're the most incredible two people she's ever seen. I said, ""Big deal. What is it?"" You know, she said, ""You have to see this."" And I saw -- it's, I guess, almost five years -- and I watched them and they had such a spirit.
And they were for me before I was even running. They were so early. And you have been such great friends, and I appreciate it. I appreciate it. And Candace, I will say that you're another one. She saw you too. She said, ""I just saw somebody with the fastest, sharpest mouth and mind."" By the way, you know, I'll tell you: I know a lot with fast mouths, but they don't have -- And I said, ""Let me take a look."" And I looked.
And it was a long time ago already. You were really young. You're young; you were really young. But we appreciate it. We appreciate everybody in this room. And people have made such progress and we're making tremendous progress. You know, something that happened recently that the press doesn't write about -- but, every year a group of wonderful people from the black colleges and universities would come up to my office.
A lot of people -- 40, 35, 50 one year. And after the second year, I said, ""How come you keep coming back?"" And they came back for money, Deneen. Money. And I said, ""Why do you have to come back? Other colleges have money. You don't do -- you don't come back every year."" And one of the gentlemen, who is a great guy, from one of the schools -- good school, very good school -- he said, ""We come back because we have to, because we need money.
And we come back and other schools don't have to because we -- they want us to come back every single year. They want us to beg."" He used that word. ""They want us to beg.""
. You know, it was the first year they came, and I didn't think anything unusual. And the second year, and they come into the Oval Office and -- a big group. I heard of almost every one of the colleges and universities. And after the third year, I said, ""You know, you shouldn't have to be coming and -- while I'll miss you if you don't come -- because they're very good people -- I said, ""You should have a long-term deal.
You shouldn't have to come back in like this. This is demeaning to you."" He said, ""It is. We love being in the Oval Office, but nobody has ever had us in the Oval Office before. But it is demeaning to us to come back."" And we just passed a bill where they're all set. They got the money and it's long-term.
They don't have to see me. I'll miss them. I'll miss them. And they'll miss me. But you know what? Now they're all set. And they have a long-term future. They were saying things like, ""We can't even fix up areas, even if we have the money because we're not sure that the next President or even you are going to approve it next year.
Maybe, for some reason, you're not going to approve it."" So that's one thing. And, you know, you've been hearing all about this, aand they're very -- they're a big heart of this nation. That's -- they do a fantastic job. I got to know them a little bit and I said, ""So, we're going to fix that up for you and we're going to do it."" And we did it -- I don't know what the length is, but it's very long-term now.
It's 10 years.
So I don't know where I'm going to be in 10 years. I probably won't be seeing them. But it was very -- I thought it was very unfair. Now, the press isn't going to write that and they're not going to write a lot of the things that were said in this room today because they just choose not to. I don't know why they choose not to, but so many nice things were said.
We have tremendous media in this room. We have tremendous media no matter where I go, I guess. And I can honestly say that's been true before I was President too, so I don't know what it is. Someday, somebody will explain that to me, but that's what it's been. I guess that's how I got to be President, to a certain extent.
But they don't explain those stories. They don't explain Opportunity Zones, where Tim Scott, from South Carolina -- he'll be with me. I'm making a speech tomorrow -- a rally. And sells out immediately; we have tremendous popularity in South Carolina. We're going to go down. Some people have said I'm ""trolling"" the Democrats. And maybe I am.
Because we did in Colorado; we did it in, you know, New Hampshire. We -- no matter where we go -- Iowa -- no matter where we go, we have much bigger crowds. If one of the -- Pocahontas has 2,000 people -- 2,000 people. And they say, ""Oh, what a crowd."" And I'll have 15,000 people inside and -- I tell you, you saw Colorado -- we had 20-, 25,000 people outside and 12,000 people inside.
They don't say anything about the crowd. And the cameras don't cover the crowds. My wife said, ""How -- how was it tonight?"" And I said, ""Great. Didn't you see?"" She said, ""I heard it."" But they never go around to show the stadium. They never do. So we put it on the Internet. That's the great thing with the Internet.
But, as she said -- but as I said, you can't disguise 25,000 or 15,000 or whatever it is. You can't disguise that. Because when you hear that sound, it sounds like an Ohio State football game, or an LSU or Alabama football game. So it's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. But they don't talk about it. And yet, when a Joe Biden, who's not sure what's happening -- but when he has an event, if he's got a crowd of -- a small crowd, just a small crowd -- they'll talk about how magnificent that was.
And yet, we'll have 25-, 30,000. We went to South Jersey -- and they actually reported it, which was shocking -- we had 175,000 requests for tickets. One hundred seventy-five thousand. And South Jersey is closed during the winter, essentially. I mean, people are opening up their hotels or opening up their homes.
But we had 175,000 requests for tickets, and the place was just swamped with tens of thousands of people outside, and they don't want to talk about it. The whole thing is sort of crazy. And I don't get it because it's so good for our country, what's happening. And whether it's black or white or any other group -- Asian, because you see what's happening with Asian; you see what's happening with Hispanic -- the best unemployment rates for every group.
For very importantly, for black -- the best unemployment we've ever had by far and getting better. And getting better. So we've set every record. Poverty numbers -- the best you've ever had. The best we've ever had for a number of groups. But black people, right now, are having the best -- statistically, the best numbers that you've ever had, and it's really an honor.
We have a situation with the virus. We've done a great job. The press won't give us credit for it. We have -- in a world that has some big problems -- you look at China and you look at industry between the two countries. And I did something that had never been done before -- because it had never been done before: I closed our borders to certain areas of the world.
I won't be specific, because it's not nice to be spe- -- you know, specific. But you understand where. And I closed the borders to certain areas of the world very early. We'd never closed a border before. We've never done that before. And flights coming in and people coming in -- because they had a very early problem.
And I closed them. I took a lot of heat from the Democrats. They said, ""What's he doing?"" Because anything I do, they'll do the opposite. Like with the wall. We want security in our country. If I would have said, ""We will not build a wall,"" they would have insisted. And I should have done that. I should have done that, David.
If I did that, we wouldn't have had no problem. Right, Jack? So I should have said --
Yeah, you're right. I should have said, ""We will not have a wall."" And they would have insisted. I would have had the wall. We would have been perfect. But, anyway -- but we've done an incredible job because we closed early. And actually, the Democrats said I was a racist. Not from black-people standpoint, but from Asian-people standpoint, from Chinese-people standpoint.
They said I was a racist because I closed our country to people coming in from certain areas. They called me a racist. These people are really in trouble. I'll tell you what: They've got problems. And now they say, ""Oh…"" We have 15 people in this country that, right now -- and then we brought in 40 from -- these were Americans that were in trouble way outside, near Japan.
And we brought them in and they were in quarantine and they're getting better. That was 40 or 42. We brought them in, which I felt we had to do. So they immediately said, ""It jumped from 15 to an extra 40."" Headline. And everyone -- no, we brought them in, Jack, because if we didn't, I mean, we're not going to let something happen.
We had to do it. And I knew immediately that the press would add it and say this like it's catastrophic, it's ba- -- but we've done a great job. Those people are all doing well. They're doing very well. The 15 -- of the 15, most of them are doing very well. One is quite sick, frankly. Most of them are doing really well.
And the 15 will soon be down to 3 or 4 because we take them off the list as they get better and they're recuperate. Like, if you had the flu, you recuperate. You get better. And they're recuperating. But we're -- think of it: We're at 15 people, and we would have been at many, many people had we not closed the border.
So we don't get credit for it. The press doesn't write it. They wrote a story today -- I gave a press conference last night that I thought was very good. It went very well. I know when it goes badly. I know better than anybody in the world if we say something -- I know better than anybody. I mean, I don't go around like Biden, where I'm in Ohio and I say, ""Thank you very much, the people of Iowa."" And they start screaming at him, ""No, no. You're in Ohio."" This happens time after time.
I don't say, ""We shot and killed 150 million people last year with guns"" -- which is exactly half of our population. And nobody talks about it. And then they say, Terrence, ""Oh, it's fine. He did wonderful tonight."" You know, that's one of those things -- not recoverable. If you say -- as an example, I'm in New Hampshire and I say that I'm in Iowa, you're dead.
He gets away with it. If you say -- if I ever said -- or Jack, if I ever said that we have to do something about guns; last year we killed 150 million people. I guess he meant a tiny -- you know, a lot; but still, a tiny, tiny fraction of that number. But if I ever said that, it may be career-threatening.
But he said -- I mean, you heard him. He said -- in fact, when he said it, I said, ""Man, that was a big mistake."" He was going to get -- he didn't get killed. They said, ""He did very well tonight."" ""He was fabulous tonight."" He said we killed 150 million people. He makes some gaffes. He makes some gaffes.
He's gaffe-prone. I'm actually not gaffe-prone. You know, if you think about it, I make these massive speeches. I'd say 70, 80 -- you know, the best speeches are the ones where I'm not on teleprompter. But teleprompter does make it a little bit easier. But you know, I make them -- I don't make gaffes.
I get no credit for it. I don't get credit for these big crowds. I never get credit. But people are starting to figure it out because the job numbers are so good and things are so good. But what where have really done a great job, I think, was what happened over the last couple of weeks with this -- and it just -- you know, this is life.
Things come up that you never even think about. Who would think that this was going to happen? You hear -- it starts with a problem that they have in China. And you say, ""That's too bad."" And then it gets bigger and starts mushrooming. And then I closed the border. I said, ""Just in case."" And we have 15 people instead of thousands of people.
Okay? It could have been thousands of people. I said, ""Just in case."" And we have 15 people instead of thousands of people. Okay? It could have been thousands of people. But we have 15 people who are almost all better now. But we do things. And it would be really nice if we could be recognized by the press fairly.
And you know what? It would be really nice if we do something wrong, we get criticized by the press. But I gave a press conference yesterday that was really a very good press conference. And some people thought it was great and most of you people saw it. It was covered live. One of the advantages is that I get covered live all the time.
And I like that better because they can't chop it up and make it look -- I'd rather be live. But it was a very good press conference. And basically it was a calming press conference. It was a conference to say we're doing well. It was a conference where I took out the statistics, which were recently done from Johns Hopkins, which is one of the great places in the country, where it says the United States is the most prepared nation -- think of that: ""Countries best prepared to deal with a Pandemic."" So this was done by Johns Hopkins and it was put out.
But they don't cover it. They don't cover it. The second is United Kingdom, then the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, South Korea, Finland. Okay. So this is it. We're number one. And then the Democrats go out -- I see Schumer going out and these guys -- just a talking point.
Frankly, I may do it if I was them, okay? To be honest. I've been known to do this too. And they ask you, ""How is he doing?"" ""Terribly. He's doing terribly. It's horrible. Horrible."" It's so bad. And I did say yesterday -- first time, because I understand politics. I think I'm pretty well -- I've only been doing it for a few years -- and I think, to the best of my knowledge, we're in the White House.
Right? But I know politics. And, you know, politics is fine. But when it comes time to talk about pandemics or whatever you may want to call it, you got to get away from politics. And the Schumers -- Cryin' Chuck and all of these people -- they can't -- Nancy -- you can't go out and just say, ""Terrible.
It's terrible."" We're doing incredibly. Think of it: 15 people. Out of billions of people, 15 people. They're getting better and soon they're all going to better, hopefully. One is in very serious shape, and we understand that, and we understand it very well, but -- but we also have the other group and they're all getting better.
So I think it's an incredible achievement that our country has done. And one thing I have to pay tribute, we have -- whether it's Dr. Fauci -- we have the best people on Earth. We have the most talented people on Earth. We're giving whatever other countries need. We're helping them. Sometimes it's over phone; sometimes we're sending people.
But we have to run our country too. A lot of people say, ""Why isn't he in China?"" Well, you know, China has to want that. And other places have -- but they're running it and they're working very hard, I will tell you. And we're in very constant communication -- President Xi and myself. Very, very constant.
But we are doing -- and, by the way, their numbers seem to have maybe -- they look like they're coming down which, eventually, hopefully, that's what's supposed to happen. But it's gone to other places and those numbers will come down. We've done an incredible job in this country and the professionals -- and me, but forget me -- I did one thing that a lot of people disagreed with, including many of the professionals: close the borders.
Because they said it's too serious a move. I took tremendous heat. Tremendous heat. It was called everything, including, David, ""racist,"" okay? I was called everything. And for a while, I said, ""Maybe I shouldn't have done that."" And now, it turned out to be great because we have so few people that have been affected.
But, I just think it's really important for the media to report stories accurately. And they don't have to go overboard, but I'll tell you, they shouldn't go overboard the other way because they are trying to build this up and they are doing things and saying things that are absolutely crazy. And they are really hurting our country -- the fake news media.
And it's not all fake, but much of it is. And they have to cover this very accurately. You know, it's different than covering other things. This country is doing great. We are in a position that few countries would be in. And if we didn't have the talent running this country -- and all the way down, from top to bottom, the job that these doctors have done, the job that the professionals are doing.
And we're working with local hospitals, we're working with the states all over the country. And, you know, I got criticized because I said $2.5 billion. That's a lot of money. See, $2.5 billion is a lot of money. And the Democrats said, ""How dare he only ask for $2.5 billion?"" But this never happened to me before.
Usually, I ask for $2.5 billion, and they said, ""We're going to give you 10 cents."" And I asked for $2.5 billion. My people came, ""This is what we need: $2.5 billion."" And I said, ""That's a lot. That's a lot of money."" Because, you know, if you're in business and you say, ""$2.5 billion,"" -- what I can build for $2.5 billion -- what I can do for that, Deneen.
So what happens is, Schumer says, ""He needs $8."" You know what I said, Jack? I said, ""I'll take it if you want to give it to me."" I thought, you know, I'll ask for a lot, and if I get a piece -- So I they criticized me because they say ""$2.5 billion, he needs more."" What they should do is say, ""Why does he need so much?"" But they don't say that because they have inverse thinking.
But the way they make you look bad is to say, ""How dare he only ask…"" Think of that: ""How dare he only ask for $2.5 billion. We demand that he take $8. I'll take it if they -- because this never happened to me before. All my life, I ask, and I get a piece of it. But the Democrats are screaming, ""How dare he do that?"" And they're not doing a good job; we're doing a great job.
While they're working on impeachment, we were working on doing this because we were hearing about it while they were wasting the country's time and the world's time, talking about the impeachment hoax. And they got shut out, except for one very foolish, frankly, not a very good senator. A man who got in on a false premise and he's not very popular in his own state.
And I guess I got half of it. I say ""52."" We got 52 and half out of 53 votes, right? But he's not a very popular guy, I can tell you. A lot of people aren't liking him too much. And he shouldn't have done what he did. But we did nothing wrong. So we had to work through an impeachment hoax. That's what they were doing.
In the meantime, we had already started preparing because we started hearing rumors. We are so prepared like we never have been prepared. Now, they'll come up with a certain amount of money -- whether it's two and a half, I'll be satisfied with that; whether it's eight and a half, we'll take that too. And we'll have a lot money left over, and we'll do a great job.
We'll probably do about the same job. But I just want to say, this is really above politics. They have to take -- it's easy for, you know, Schumer. ""What kind of a job do you think they're doing?"" He should say, ""They've done a great job."" And you know what? He'd actually pick up votes. People would respect him for that.
Instead, ""What kind of job…"" ""They're doing a terrible job."" He has no idea. We had a trade deal. I talked about it a little bit yesterday. A phenomenal deal with China. Billions and billions of dollars of worth is going to come into our country. Many billions of dollars. It's a great deal. And they went to Schumer and they went to others.
Talking points. They went to the Democrats and they said, ""What do you think of the deal?"" ""Oh, it's terrible. Terrible."" They didn't even know what the deal was. In fact, he said, ""They took off the tariffs. They didn't want the tariffs."" I put the tariffs on when he thought I took them off. We didn't. We have $250 billion.
Look at it. We get 25 percent on $250 billion, then we get more above that. And I left them on. People said, ""That's amazing."" But the Democrats didn't know that. They said, ""He took off the tariffs."" And you know what? They got killed. But the press doesn't report that. So the natural instinct -- and again, I should say, I do it too.
They'll ask me and, you know, you do it too. I guess it's a natural political instinct. But when they say, ""What kind of deal is it?"" ""Terrible. Terrible. Terrible."" And people get it. With what we're talking about now with the virus, we can't do that. We have to do it differently. If we're doing a great job, we should congratulate these professionals that are the best in the world.
And you know what? If we were doing a bad job, we should also be criticized. But we have done an incredible job. We're going to continue. It's going to disappear. One day -- it's like a miracle -- it will disappear. And from our shores, we -- you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away.
We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows. The fact is, the greatest experts -- I've spoken to them all. Nobody really knows. But we have done and our professionals have done a fantastic job. We're working with other countries. We're trying to help some other countries. A couple of them have gotten hit pretty hard.
South Korea and Italy, in particular. They've been hit pretty hard. And it'll all work out. And I just want to thank all of the people that have worked with us in government and some of these great professionals because they have been incredible -- the job. To think of it -- with all of what you see going on -- 15 people.
We brought in the others, but -- and they're doing good. But 15 people is almost, I would say, a miracle. Also, what I want to do, though, is I want to thank the black people of America. Because, frankly, you people, what you've gone through over the years, and now you're making a comeback like you've never -- and I had a phrase -- I had a phrase during speeches, during rallies, and I'd use it whenever I saw, whenever we had a lot of black people in there, okay?
And I have to say, I'd go through a list: You had the worst crime. You had the lowest housing ownership. You had -- and I'd read 10, 15, 20 points. And, look, a couple of them -- NBC just left because they don't want to hear this because they don't want -- . She just left. No, she just left, from NBC -- because it's owned by Comcast.
. But I know this. As I'm talking, I'm looking at her, she's not writing anything down because she knows she's not going to report any of this. She only wants to report something bad and there's nothing bad in this room. What's going on in this room is incredible.
But when you look -- when you look at what's happening -- and I used to use the expression, ""What do you have to lose?"" It was much more effective when I said, ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" -- which I did a lot, but some people said it's a bad word. Okay? If somebody else said it, it's okay. If I say it, it's a bad word.
But it was much more -- when I said, ""What the hell…"" They talked about it. You have tremendous crime. Tremendous lack of ownership. The worst schools. The worst this. I read, like -- right? -- 10 points. And one day I'm saying -- you know, I had that on the teleprompter, which are always a little boring.
But here I'm reading these points and I'm looking at the audience, I said -- it wasn't like written. I said, ""The Democrats have ruled for 110 years. And you have all these horrible statistics."" I said, ""Vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose?"" You know, I came off the stage. And my people said, ""Sir, that was quite disrespectful."" I said, ""It was true."" So I said, ""What do you have to lose?"" So now you look what Tim Scott has done with the Opportunity Zones.
I mean, those Opportunity Zones are incredible. Your colleges and universities that we've just talked about. So many things. But criminal justice reform -- this guy walked in. People could not get it approved. Obama couldn't get it approved. And nobody could get it approved.
And I had to call in a lot of chips because we needed some very conservative Republicans to get this approved. And yet, we had some very -- we had Mike Lee. We had Ted Cruz. We had guys that were already onto it. It's one of the reasons -- I said, ""Whoa."" But Chuck Grassley was already there. And I said, ""That's incredible that you have some of our toughest, most conservative people already there."" And I was able to get other people, plus we were able to get it through, and it was a great achievement.
. And just to finish, though, I'll tell you why people tend not to do things. Normally, people would be happy with that and the people that know are. You know better than anybody, Alveda, because you are sitting next to us and she's the one.
But -- and you heard this story maybe. Van Jones was in my office, almost in tears -- and he was actually in tears -- asking for help. And I think that's good. I think that's noble and that's a good thing. And he was there because of Jared. And there was a group, and they were saying, ""It's dead. We're five short."" And a couple of the ones that were not against us -- ""we're going to delay the bill"" -- and then it goes to asunder, right?
It's goes to ashes. When you delay it for a period of time it's, you know, they were going to do things to delay it. Very easily to do -- very easy to do. I got them to be good. I didn't get their vote; I didn't need their vote. But they were great because they didn't delay it. And, I mean, they were going to filibuster the bill so it would've gone on and on. And then, it would have just gone away, and people say, ""Hey, everybody has to go home.
We have to start this again."" And they didn't do that. They were great. And we got the votes necessary. We got it done. Nobody else could have done it, in this case, but me. Nobody else could have done it. And Jared came in and he said, ""You're the only one."" And I got it done. He felt it was so important.
And I was getting mixed reviews. Now, I'm getting tremendous reviews. But some of the people that didn't vote for it, they're saying, ""I wish we voted for criminal justice reform."" So Van Jones is up making a speech. I said to my wife, ""Come. This will be going to be very nice. Look."" He's on MSDNC, right?
The station. All right? Do you ever hear that one: ""MSDNC""? No, it's a natural -- right? That's a natural. The worst. I mean, these people. I'll tell you what: NBC is worse, in my opinion, than CNN. They're worse. They're absolute bad people. And they paid me a lot of money and I made them a lot of money with ""The Apprentice."" They paid me a lot of money over the years.
And I can't believe it. They're just bad -- they're bad people. They're really bad people. And they don't report the truth. And neither does CNN. And neither does a lot of the media. But -- so Van Jones is on there. I say to my wife, ""This is going to be great to watch. Let's watch this. He's going to be so nice to us, because without me…"" So he wanted to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton.
And then he went through a list of many people. He went through a list of many people. He went through a list -- he didn't mention your name either, by the way.
He didn't mention anybody in this room. But -- and, by the way, maybe people in this room, maybe he wasn't aware. Maybe, you know -- but he went through a list of people that I never heard of. And he said, at the end -- it was the end of the show, which I think nobody watched because I don't think -- is the show still on? I don't think so. But it was the end of the how and he thanked a whole lot of people.
I said to my wife, ""He never thanked me. You know why? Because I don't talk about it, people aren't going to know. I said to my wife, ""Nobody could have done it. President Obama couldn't do it. Bush couldn't do it. Nobody could do it but me. I got it done."" I'm good at getting things approved.
I'm very good at this. Like you're good at things, I'm good at things. He's good at football. This is guy is good at -- I never to follow him speaking. I'll ask Scott. But I got it done. And he didn't mention my name. But I'll tell you what he did do. At the end of the show, he mentioned all of these names.
And then he said, ""Now, look, we have one thing we have to do this year. We have to defeat this President of the United States. And you go out, and we have to defeat this President of the United States."" I never forgot it. That was a few months ago. I will never forget it. It's -- I have the great memory of all times.
I will never forget that because it was bad and very, very -- it very terrible. Not mentioning my name was bad. It's not that I want -- I get enough publicity. But you know what? This was an important thing. To my family, it was an important thing. I mean, this guy worked so hard on getting that done and he didn't even mention -- or your name, by the way.
But he didn't mention our name. We were like nothing. We were like nothing. And I know how some of you feel. You do things and you don't get mentioned. Okay? But it's the same thing. But then, on top, the indignity of saying, ""We must now focus on one thing. We must defeat this President of the United States."" And then the show ended.
My wife said, ""That wasn't too good, was it?"" It's a disgrace. So I just want to thank everyone. You're a very special people to me, and I really do appreciate your being here. And all of this -- you know, these stars, I hope you're making a hell of a lot of money. Because I'll lose billions of dollars.
I'm doing -- I lose a fortune between what I don't do and what it costs me. You know what my legal fees are? Tens of millions of dollars. I spend tens of millions of dollars on legal fees, defending myself against scum because they're scum. And then they say I get rich on this. If a man from an Arab country goes into one of my hotels, they say, ""Trump is getting rich."" They don't realize I don't even take foreign -- if somebody gets in, you lose billions of dollars, but if a person rents a hotel room for 300 bucks, it's like a major event.
These are very dishonest people. Hopefully, out of all of this, the press will become much more honest. There's no other word -- ""honest."" And if they do, we have achieved something that will be great. But we have our press, because -- our press is the Internet. Our press is being with you.
Our press is -- as much as they hate all of us, I guess -- but they can't put the cameras -- although I did notice the one that did leave was NBC, which is pretty pathetic. But we're going to go into another room. We're going to celebrate because we have a whole group of people. I want to thank the people at this table.
You've been so incredible. And beyond this table -- where is she? She's back there. She's --
I don't know what happened. She is so great. Thank you, honey. I'm pointing at you. These big guys are standing right -- these great photographers are in front of you. But I want to thank you all because you've been fantastic.
Yes, go ahead. One second. We'll do this.
. This could be overturned easily. We need that four years because, you know, I say it's like a tree. You plant it, but takes a while to grab root.
Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you everybody. We're going over now. We're going over to the East Room.
Yes, what?
Well, I think the press has been really out of line. And I think they're also very worried that, you know, we're going to be running against somebody. And they see these characters up onstage and, you know, anything can happen in an election. And they see these people. And if any of these people ever did happen to assume the presidency, you would have a crash like you've never seen before.
And I think the market is also putting that into the equation. But the virus -- we're doing a very professional job. We have the best people. Our Vice President is working very hard. We have tremendous people involved. And we're doing -- as I said, we're at 15 people and they're getting better. We have one that's quite ill.
We got them late. And -- but we have a country that's pulling together and pulling together really well. I think the Democrats should not try and make this -- or the Republicans -- should not make this a political issue. This is above politics. Again, we closed the borders very early. We didn't let certain regions of the world come in. By doing that, we really saved a lot.
We made a great decision. I took a lot of heat over that decision, but it turned out to be the right decision. And that's why we're at 15, and other places have many more. So I just want to thank you, and thank the media too. Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-03-19,"Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have President Bolsonaro with us from Brazil. He has done a very outstanding job; ran one of the incredible campaigns. Somebody said it, a little bit, reminded people of our campaign, which I'm honored by. But it was a tough, well-fought-out campaign. And we are going to be discussing, today, Venezuela.
We'll be discussing trade. We'll be discussing many subjects. And Brazil is a great friend. I think probably because of the relationship that we have, Brazil and the United States have never been closer than they are right now.
Thank you very much. That's very nice. Thank you. And I think -- before we begin, I think we would like to -- you know, Brazil is a great, great soccer power and a great country. And we're going to present that, and I believe they have one also. But you know all about Brazil being the great soccer power.
They have great, great players. I can still remember Pelé and so many others. You've had a fantastic history. So we're going to exchange jerseys. I see that we got one, and this is the U.S. National Team. And so that's an honor to give that to you. Thank you very much.
Yeah, right. Right.
Yes.
Well, we're looking at it very strongly. We're very inclined to do that. The relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better. I think there was a lot of hostility with other Presidents. There is zero hostility with me. And we were going -- we're going to look at that very, very strongly, in terms of whether it's NATO or it's something having to do with alliance.
But we have a great alliance with Brazil -- better than we've ever had before.
Well, we have. We're working on different military sites and military options. We're working on visas and going in a much easier fashion. All of that is good. And we have many things that Brazil would like, and I think we're working on those things. One of the big elements of the relationship is trade. Brazil makes great product and we make great product.
And our trade has been never as good as it should be in the past. And in some cases, it should be far, far more. So I think our trade with Brazil will go substantially up in both directions, and we look forward to that. And that's one of the things that Brazil would like to see. Steve. Steve.
Well, we don't want to say exactly. I know exactly what I want to happen in Venezuela, but we're going to be talking about different things. All options are on the table. And it's a shame what's happening in Venezuela -- the death, and the destruction, and the hunger. Hard to believe one of the wealthiest countries is now one of the poorest and most impoverished countries.
So we'll be talking about that in great length.
I am supporting their efforts to join, and we are just going to decide -- I think I can speak for both countries: All options are on the table. Every option is on the table with respect to Venezuela.
We haven't even discussed it. We're going to discuss it today.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years. And then he got to a vote and he said, ""Thumbs down."" And our country would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have had great healthcare. So he campaigned.
He told us, hours before, that he was going to repeal and replace. And then for some reason -- I think I understand the reason -- he ended up going thumbs up. And, frankly, had we even known that, I think we would have gotten a vote because we could have gotten somebody else. So I think that's disgraceful.
Plus, there are other things. I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
He does.
He does. He has my full support.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-05-20,"Where's Andy?
Hi, Andy.
I hope you enjoyed that.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you very much. It was a great honor. What a crowd.
Well I do think so, Andy, you know we have -- if you take a look, we have the best employment numbers in the history of the state, and country, by the way. But Pennsylvania has never done this well. We've got steel back, we brought coal back, we brought so many things back, And the state now is doing better than it's ever done, but we have the unem -- lowest unemployment rate that we've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania, and companies are holding back like clockwork so we're very happy about.
I know.
Well, we're down 17% from last year. And a lot of its doctors prescribing too much and a lot of things happening but opioid's a big problem. Drugs, generally, are a big problem, and we have it down, we have been very tough, really beyond tough, and it's a horrible problem, there's no question about it but we're working with the companies, we're working with doctors and we're getting them to prescribe less.
You know, that's a terrible thing, the whole Opioid. They take -- they take a little bit and they have the big drug addicts on it, it's no good. We're also coming up with plans. We're spending a lot of money finding a medication on medicine, where it's not addictive, when you can feel the pain because you know the Opioids work for the pain but they also destroy lives.
So we're getting it taken care of.
Well, always, we are going to have preexisting conditions to be taken care of. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare, which is the worst part of Obamacare, we have paid to have ban insured, so we literally have to pay a premium of price, and we got rid of that because, you know, we voted that out.
We're coming up with a great health care plan, and if we win back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency. We're going to have fantastic health care and the plan is coming out over the next four weeks.
We're building massive amounts of oil right now. By the end of next year we're going to have probably close to 500 miles of wall that's gonna stop a lot of the problem that we have. We're working with the Democrats but they seem to want open borders. It's crazy, they want open borders. They want these people to flood in, it means crimes and problems, but we are -- we are we are literally apprehending 40, 50, 60,000 people and probably even more, It's a big problem.
When we have the wall up, the problem will cease to a large extent. If the Democrats wanted to play the game fairly and like, in 15 minutes we can have it solved, but they refuse to vote for it. So they are really for open borders, they're really for crimes, because that means crime. But we're stopping a lot of people and we're stopping all of the bad ones.
And the ones that get through ultimately are going out.
Well, the coal mining industry's really starting to go, you know, it was -- it was out of business with the Democrats, you know that. They had it restricted out of business. Now it's really starting to go in a very positive direction. Big numbers are coming out, foreign countries like Vietnam and other countries are buying our coal in reckon amounts and whether it's West Virginia or Pennsylvania a lot of other place, we're selling a lot of coal.
I intend that the coal industry would be -- and I call it ""Clean Coal"" because you could do it. Clean coal is really heading back in the direction and you see it. Minors are going back to work that never thought they'd see that job again. I actually told of it the very beginning, ""Are you looking for other jobs?"" They said, "" Sir, we really want -- "" This is before I won.
They said, ""Sir, we really want to have coal. That's what we want to do. We want to dig coal."" That decides, dig hole, and now they're digging coal again so I'm really honored by that, and Pennsylvania is one the big beneficiaries.
No. I know the state very well. As you know I went to school in Pennsylvania. I love the state, I love the people. They are hard working, they're incredible. They've put up with so much when all the companies left these corporations, these giant corporations left, they took away the jobs, they took away the wealth.
Here's the good news, they're all coming back, they're all coming back, you see it happening.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Andy. You take care of yourself.
Back to Washington.
Well it's a very important race. Fred Keller is a tremendous guy, very successful. Wants to go to Washington, gives up a lot to do it. He's a great Republican. He's been a really inspiration to a lot of people. It's really important to people to get out and vote on Tuesday, which is tomorrow. And if he wins, I think that sends a big signal because we have tremendous momentum on our side, and I think it's gonna send a big signal.
It's gonna be a tight race but if he wins, I think tonight would've helped but it's gonna be a tremendous sight.
Thanks. Thanks very much, Andy.
","Interview: Andy Mehalshick of WBRE/WYOU 22 Wilkes-Barre, PA Interviews Donald Trump",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-andy-mehalshich-wbre-wilkes-barre-may-20-2019
Laura Farris,United Kingdom,2020-05-05,"This legislation has been a long time coming, and for those on the Front Bench on this side and across the Floor of the House it ​has been a labour of love. I commend my right hon.
There is so much that the Bill will achieve. I start by praising the creation of the post of domestic abuse commissioner. The Home Affairs Committee had the benefit of hearing from her a fortnight ago when she gave evidence on the impact of the lockdown on women with abusive partners. The cogency of her evidence, and her understanding of the pressure points and the unique challenges for women seeking escape, left no doubt in my mind about how vital her role will be.
Then there is the simple act of creating a statutory definition that expresses domestic abuse in all its myriad forms, which is what I think makes the Bill so much more than the sum of its parts. When the Sex Discrimination Act was passed in 1975, it was on the face of it a law that gave women the right to bring cases to employment tribunals, but in fact it was a piece of great social reform that said to women, for the first time really, “We understand the wrong that you experience. We give it definition as a statutory tort and we give you a right of enforcement.” The Bill has many of those features. It shines a spotlight in the darkest corners, and it puts women centre stage.
It is with the darkest corners in mind that I speak in support of the amendments jointly proposed by the Mother of the House, the right hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) on the rough sex defence. Through that defence, acts of extreme violence are given a different complexion because they occurred during sex, and it is said that the victim wanted it—something that the Prime Minister himself has said is unacceptable. I know that there are big brains on the Front Bench giving this serious thought. Their task is technical, and it must avoid unintended consequences.
The Lord Chancellor was correct when he said that rough sex is not a defence. That is true, but it does not prevent a defendant from establishing that there was consent when the victim is not alive to tell the tale. The Natalie Connolly story is a case in point. I cannot imagine how hard it was for her family to hear how John Broadhurst inflicted more than 75 catastrophic injuries on their daughter, sprayed bleach in her face and left her in a pool of blood. And yet he established in court that one of the most extreme and violent of those acts—the intimate insertion of a bottle of carpet cleaner—when he had beaten her black and blue, and she was very close to death, was done with her consent. In fact, at paragraph 31 of the sentencing remarks, the court found that it was done at her instigation. It is easy to see why her father, Alan, told The Sun in an interview last month that at times, it felt like Natalie was on trial. That is why I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest for affording Natalie the dignity in this Chamber that she was deprived of in her death.
Natalie’s case is by no means an isolated example. Take Laura Huteson, who in 2019 had her throat slit by her partner, or Anna Banks, who was throttled to death by her partner a few years earlier. In all these cases, what is really just extreme violence against women is given a veneer of complicity through the sexual element. The victim has no voice. The lurid details of a private encounter are made public in circumstances where, had she lived and the case proceeded as one of rape or ​sexual assault, she would have been anonymised, and the man receives a derisory sentence on a manslaughter conviction.
We must recognise that violence of this nature is becoming normalised. ComRes undertook a survey last November of a large group of women aged between 18 and 39. Of them, 70% said that they had experienced strangulation during sex, and of that cohort, more than half said that the man had not sought their consent before doing so. They had not wanted it, and some of them gave moving interviews to the BBC in which they said they thought the man was going to kill them.
This landmark legislation offers an opportunity for the Government to show cultural leadership. I hope that it will look to the horizon and build in statutory protections that will keep women in relationships safe for the future.
",2020 Speech on the Domestic Abuse Bill,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/laura-farris-2020-speech-on-the-domestic-abuse-bill/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-10-08,"Really good, and First Lady is doing really good. I thought Mark was fantastic, and I love your show.
Yeah, I just saw the doctors today. They think I’m in great shape. I’m in great shape.
And I’ll tell you, I took this Regeneron. It’s phenomenal. Eli Lilly has something very comparable. It’s phenomenal. It’s a whole new day. It’s all… If you go back a few months, nobody ever even thought about this stuff. We came up with it, and I’m going to have it delivered to every hospital we have sick people with the COVID, or the China Virus as we call it, and we’re going to make people better. It actually made me better. I went in, I could have left a day later.
I’m telling you Sean, it was incredible. So, that’s Regeneron. But again, Eli Lilly has something similar. The kind of things we’re coming up with now are incredible. Remdesivir, but that’s a little bit different, works much differently actually. But these things are absolutely incredible. I think I’m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally probably in Florida on Saturday night. I might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night. It’s incredible what’s going on, because I feel so good.
Well, what we’re doing is probably the test will be tomorrow, the actual test, because there’s no reason to test all the time. But they found very little the infection or virus, if any. I don’t know that they found any. I didn’t go into it greatly with the doctors. We have these great doctors at Walter Reed, and you do rely on them. They’re really fantastic talents, and they came in from Johns Hopkins also and other places. Yeah. When you’re president, there are so many doctors looking over me. I think I’m the most analyzed human being in the world right now. But we have… They had people at not only Walter Reed which is incredible with the job they do, but also Johns Hopkins and other hospitals. I think they’re amazed at how quickly this went frankly.
Well, I didn’t even want to use them. Last time, I had a big problem. They isolated my mikes when I had one debate… We had three debates with Hillary. Or I think the first debate, they… Excuse me. On the first debate, they asked isolated the mike and they isolated it very, very seriously, and they actually apologized to me. And I said-
… “What’s this all about?” They were Clinton people. And I said, “We ought to just do the debates ourselves, John. We ought to just do it ourselves.” I pick… I’m the president, so we won’t to have debates. I’d rather just do it ourselves. Pick some good anchor. So I ended up with Chris Wallace who’s essentially… Look, his father did me once or twice. Twice, I guess. Those 60 minutes, he was great, Mike. Chris is not Mike that I can tell you. He’s not even close, but Chris was terrible. He was protecting Biden the whole night. I asked Biden about, “Why did he get all of that money from the Mayor of Russia, from the wife of the Mayor of Russia?” Then Chris wouldn’t let that be answered.
When I said, “What did you do with a billion dollars? You’re not getting a billion dollars to Ukraine unless you get rid of the prosecutor.” Chris wouldn’t let that. He protected him. The guy was choking like a dog. He couldn’t answer the questions and he was choking like a dog. And Chris kept staying, and so now we have another one. I didn’t know this, but the other one is from C-SPAN and he’s never-Trumper, and I think somebody said he worked for Biden at one point. These are the people we get.
That’s okay, because I’ve had some bad ones over the years, and I’ve got an unblemished record I think in the debating world according to the polls. But I will say this, that it’s a very sad thing. Now you have this Debate Commission. It’s a joke. The commission’s a joke. Take a look at the letter they wrote me four years ago when they apologized. They were oscillating my mike. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to Hillary, crooked Hillary who turns out to be very crooked.
Look at all the stuff we found out on Obama and Biden and her. So we’ll see what happens. But no, I’m not interested in doing a virtual. I’m not Joe Biden. I’m not going to do a virtual debate, sit behind a computer screen. That gives them the answers, because there’ll be handing him the answers just like he gets what he asks. He does news conferences, he does them and they give him the answer and they give him the question and they give him what kind of a news conference. He does them all the time. He was choking like a dog the other night, but Chris Wallace bailed him in. He just bailed him in or bailed him out.
Well, I might. I’ll do it right through your show. Let’s go, Joe. Let’s have a fair… Let’s get a fair anchor, somebody like a great Sean Hannity. We’ll get Rush.
We’ll get Mark. We’ll get Laura.
We got a lot of them out there. We got a lot. We’ll get Jesse or Pete. We got a lot of them.
So now I find out the guy that’s doing it from C-SPAN is a never-Trumper, but I don’t mind that. Look at the people I’ve had in the past, and I’ve always won the debates. I had Martha Raddatz. Her hatred was so incredible I couldn’t believe it, but I beat Hillary in that debate easily. So I don’t mind that. It’s not even that. But I’m not going to sit behind a computer and have somebody feed him answers, because he has no idea, because he won’t be president for three months before the wonderful Kamala takes over with her. She’s the most liberal person in the senate. She’s not a socialist. She’s a step beyond socialism as you know.
I thought Mike was great, legitimately. I don’t mean because he’s with me and he’s my friend and he’s done a great job as vice president, I thought he was great. He’s a calm person. We’re really a good combination. A lot of people have said that for a long time. He’s a calm person. He’s a good person, and he was just… He couldn’t believe some of the things she was saying, and he really didn’t. He couldn’t believe it what she was saying. They lie. They lie so much, like fracking.
Him and her for a year, whatever the Democrat debate said, we are against fracking. We will… Biden says, “We will never ever see fracking and…” etc. As soon as he gets the nomination, he has to center over a little bit. No, we want to go fracking. We’ll be fracking. Her too, even her. I mean, she’s a super… Then they get beat up by AOC plus 3, because they said, you never said that before. Now the press gives them a pass. The reason they give them a pass is because they are fake. The news is fake, the enemy of the people and the press gives them a pass. If I ever did that, I would be excoriated.
Yeah, terrible thing.
I think it was a terrible thing to say. I think it’s so disrespectful to the people, and he should have said something, and say, “Look, to the best of my knowledge, this is probably what I’d do.” I think what he said was so disrespectful to the process and to the people. What he said then was just disgraceful. But what that means really is that they’re going to do it, because obviously, that means 100% that’s what they’re going to do. No, they’re going to end the filibuster and they’re going to do things that you wouldn’t have thought. I’d been fighting the filibuster with Mitch for a long time, because I said, “Mitch, they’re going to do whatever. If they ever got in, Schumer would do that on day one.” I agree that what they did was right.
You take a look at what Mitch and some very good Republican senators, because it’s good for the country. But I said, “Here’s the problem. If they ever got in, day one, this would be the first move they make, end the filibuster,” the nuclear option as they call it. And they’ll do that… Not a week will go by, probably not a day will go by. But again, Harry Reid did it, that’s why we have so many judges. I want to thank you very much, Harry Reid. Because Harry Reid, he ended the filibuster and I’m going to have 300 judges by the time I finish. 300, it’s a record by the end of the first term. Think of that. By the end of the first term, I have 300 judges just about give or take a few couple. And-
… it’s all because of… Think of it, Sean. It’s all because of Harry Reid and a lot of good work-
… by a lot of good Republicans including Mitch.
Well, he’s got a lot of non-answers. Look at Second Amendment, you never talk about Second Amendment. He wants to take away your guns 100%. He put Beto as a… He turned out to be… He was exposed by Ted Cruz and me, I think I helped a lot too. But he was exposed as a clown, as much worse than that, but I want to be nice, because it’s a nice evening show. But he was exposed as a clown. He wants to take away your guns. He’s going to take away your Second Amendment. Nobody ever… Nobody asks him about the Second Amendment anymore. Do you notice that? The Second Amendment is very important. It’s a big thing that we campaign on it. I protected this.
If I weren’t president, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does it. Nobody’s talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No, he’s not pro-life. What is he? Why don’t you ask him that question? He doesn’t want to talk about it. But he endorsed a Governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby late term abortion, but executed a baby because he said the baby can be born and then you can kill the baby. He’s totally in favor of that. I can tell you, your pro-life groups are… They’re in mess. This is their one shot because what’s going on is so bad.
It’s so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby after the baby is born, that’s… When you talk about late term abortion, this is early term execution, and it’s a very, very bad thing. But you don’t ever hear everybody talking about pro-life, pro-choice with Biden. Did you ever hear it? I haven’t heard it. Very rarely do you hear it? I don’t think he’d know how to discuss it. But very importantly, a Second Amendment. They just don’t discuss the Second Amendment. He’s going to take your guns away. So everybody with a gun, you can’t vote for him because you’re not going to have your gun. At the same time, they want to defund the police.
So if you’re not going to have police protection and by the way, you can’t have a gun. So if one of these maniacs breaks into your house at night because there are no cops around and you don’t have a gun to protect yourself, that’s a great combination. The suburbs are going to fall. A lot of people talk about the women of the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, they do or don’t like Trump. I don’t know. But what I’ve done is incredible for the suburbs. The suburbs are over as you know. The suburbs have become more unsafe than the cities run by the Democrats. And so I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I’m the one that’s protecting them both in terms of law and order and in terms of zoning.
They want to build low-income housing right next to your house as the American dream is destroyed, but they don’t talk to Biden about this. They don’t talk to him about law and order. I said to him the other night, “Mention the words law and order.” He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. I said, “Don’t mention the word law and order. Go ahead.” He wouldn’t do it. And then of course Chris Wallace came in to protect him.
And I condemn the people on the left like Antifa that are burning down your cities all summer long and without any control whatsoever. They’re all Biden people, meaning not Biden. Biden’s not smart enough to know what the hell it even is, but they’re of that philosophy. I condemn them very strongly, very, very strongly. It’s not just the right. It’s the right, it’s the left. But the left has been the problem up for a long time. Antifa is a big, big problem. I see Whitmer today, she’s complaining, but it was our justice department that arrested the people that she was complaining about.
It was my justice department that arrested them. But instead, she goes and does her little political act and she keeps her state closed although we just won the big case as you know to open up Michigan, because what she’s doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed, the schools are closed and all state is closed. People are being hurt very badly by it in the form of drinking and suicides and depression. It’s a very sad thing. But now, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes. And very sadly, if you take a look, he wants to raise taxes, but he says he’s going to end our tax cut. Well, people are getting actually much more.
but he wants to take all that away. So therefore, if you do nothing else, you’re raising taxes by the largest percentage in the history of our country. If he terminated my tax cuts, which is one of the reasons that our economy has done so great, even now in this pandemic which hopefully we’re rounding the turn and we have incredible cures and a lot of therapeutics and the vaccines are going to be coming very soon. But I’ll tell you what I took is incredible. To me, I viewed it as a cure. It’s incredible, and we’re going to get it to everybody free of charge.
It’s going to hospitals. Starting very soon, the military is going to be delivering it. But he’s looking to do big, big tax cuts, big, big tax increases at a level that’s never been seen. Nobody’s ever gotten the cuts that I got. I got the biggest tax cuts ever given as you know Sean, better than probably most. But he’s going to end those tax cuts and reverse them. And now, people are going to pay $2000 plus child tax credits, all that. It’s going to be a disaster for our country. It’s going to put our country into a depression. Your 401ks are going to go down the tubes, and your jobs are going to go away, and you’re going to have a depression the likes of which our country has never seen before. And that possibly includes 1929.
Well, it’s a deal that was conceived up by not smart people, AOC plus 3 and others, but I don’t even think they had any experience in the environment. But this was a deal conceived up. The real price is $100 trillion. That’s more money that this country could make in 100 years if things went well. They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows. Little windows, so you can’t see out, you can see the light. The whole thing is so crazy. It’s such a crazy thing. Take a look, Biden agreed to this with crazy Bernie, because they have the manifesto.
They’ve agreed to most of these things, and it’s going to cost more money. Our country will be a Ninth World country, not a Third World country, a Ninth World country. We won’t have energies. Look at what’s happening with the rolling blackouts in California? Looking at where California is going to have to ration water? You know why? Because they set millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren’t doing very well without water to be honest with you. But it’s a very sad thing that’s happening. It’s still common sense. Even the fires in California. I talk about, you need…
I was with governor Newsom. I get along with him very well. We disagree on a lot of things, but I get along with him. Number one, you should let water come down from the North and accept it instead of throwing it out to the Pacific. But you also have to have forest management. We send them so much money. I don’t have to, but I want to help California. But they have the biggest forest fires because they don’t manage their land. They don’t have separators. They have trees that have been laying on the ground that are stone cold dead, dry like a matchstick. You throw a cigarette butts on between the leaves and the trees, everything catches on fire. You lose 200,000 acres in a short period of time. They get to manage their forest. And if they manage their forest, you’re not going to see the forest fires.
Well, I want them to vote, but I will say this, absentee is okay, because absentee ballots… Excuse me. Absentee ballots are fine, because absentee ballots, you request, you ask for a ballot and you request and that’s it. Absentee ballots are absolutely fine. You request them, you fill them in, you send them back in. But these unsolicited ballots, universal unsolicited ballots Sean, it’s going to be a disaster the likes of which we’ve never seen. We will never have seen an election like what’s going to take place. Thousands of ballots all over the country are being reported. Some thrown in garbage cans with my name on them. Some thrown in trays in a river. What’s going on is absolutely crazy. We have people watching. We have US attorneys watching. We have sheriffs watching. We have US Marshals watching. But with all of that-
… you’re talking about millions of ballots are being sent out-
Well, my supporters are going to be mostly people that vote. They go to the vote the old fashioned where it’s like go to the voting booth and vote, which first of all, we should have voter ID all over the country. We don’t. When you buy something, you have voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, you had to have voter ID.
Right. But to get into vote, you don’t need voter ID in many places. In many places, you do. Indiana has a great system. You have many places where you do have it. But we should have voter ID, universal voter ID. When you go to vote, they should see who you are, make sure that it’s not fraudulent. But this will be one of the greatest fraudulent, most fraudulent elections ever because of this whole thing with… They’re sending out millions and millions and millions of ballots. Where are they sending them? Who’s sending them? Where are they going? Where are they coming back from? How many are fraudulent? Are they being thrown away? Are they being sold?
Are they being harvested? It’s a terrible thing, Sean. Despite that, I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory. I saw some polls just now, some real polls not the fake news polls where they put out fake numbers like at CNN and ABC, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, NBC. It’s the same stuff as I had. It’s not nearly as bad as it used to be. It used to be much worse believe it or not. It’s hard to believe when you think of it. But I’m looking at polls that are doing great. We’re doing great in Ohio. We’re doing great in Iowa. We’re doing great in many, many places, many places. Then you come home, you turn on television. You say, gee, I’m four down. I can’t believe it. But they’re the fake polls.
We caught them spying on our campaign. This is treason. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected administration/ president. We have all the evidence down. Now, we have to see what the law enforcement’s going to do with it, but we caught them spying. As sure as you’re sitting there, I assume you’re sitting, but as-
… sure as you’re sitting there, we caught them spying on our campaign. You know that almost better than anybody. They get everything wrong. We caught them spying in our campaign. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected… And then they talk about, we want a peaceful transition of power. Peaceful-
Peaceful transition. Look what they did. They spent three and a half years trying to terminate a presidency.
It’s doing really well.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Sean.

James Brokenshire,United Kingdom,2018-07-24,"Since we published our Housing White Paper last year, we have been making significant progress in fixing the broken housing market, reforming our planning system and increasing housing ​supply to start to improve affordability, as well as taking steps to ensure that communities have the safe and high-quality homes they need to thrive.
Our new national planning policy framework—coming into force this summer following our consultation—will transform the planning system, and at of autumn Budget we set out £15 billion the new financial support for housing, taking our total investment to £44 billion over the next five years. Since 2010 we have delivered over a million new homes, and in 2016-17 we saw 217,350 new homes delivered—the highest number in all but one of the last 30 years.
Our new national housing agency, Homes England, is taking a more assertive approach to getting homes built. This has already started—for example in Burgess Hill, a site that is desperately needed for affordable housing but which sat undeveloped. Homes England has now stepped in, bought the land and is delivering the infrastructure. Today I am announcing a plan to build over 3,000 homes on the site.
But we need to go further, and in particular we recognise the housing market needs an injection of innovation and competition. Getting new players into the market and embracing modern methods of construction will allow us to build faster and drive up choice and quality for consumers.
To help do this, today I am announcing that the local authority accelerated construction programme is moving into its delivery phase. Through this fund, we are releasing £450 million to speed up delivery of homes on surplus local authority land and encouraging the use of modern methods of construction and SME builders. Homes England has started the process of funding negotiations with a number of local authorities to ensure their sites can deliver greater pace and innovation in house building.
But this is not just about the number of homes, it is also about ensuring we deliver the right homes in the right places, and building communities that people are happy to call home.
Today I am announcing that we have launched a new Homes England programme to deliver the community housing fund. Community groups and local authorities in all parts of England outside London are now able to apply for capital and revenue funding to bring community-led housing schemes forward. Homes England has published a prospectus on its website at: www.gov.uk/topic/housing/funding-programmes.
Through this fund, housing will be delivered where the mainstream market is unable to deliver. The housing it helps provide will be tailored to meet specific local needs and will remain locally affordable in perpetuity. It will help sustain local communities and local economies and help raise the bar in design and construction standards. Now that it is launched, it will unlock a pipeline of thousands of new homes and help this innovative sector grow to make a substantial additional contribution to housing supply. A similar programme is being developed for London—delivered by the GLA—and an announcement on that will be made shortly.
Finally, for too long, the leasehold market has been left to evolve without much attention to who actually benefits. We are determined to reform the leasehold market to make it work for consumers. We have announced a programme of leasehold reform including a ban on new leasehold houses, restricting ground rents to a peppercorn and making enfranchisement easier, quicker and cheaper. We will bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity, but we want the industry to change in advance of legislation and have written to developers setting out our expectations.
Today I can also confirm that Government funding schemes for housing supply will no longer support the unjustified use of leasehold for new houses, wherever possible, and that we will hardwire this as a condition into any new schemes. In future, ground rents on new long leases in flats will be limited to a peppercorn.

James K. Polk,United States of America,1845-12-02 00:00:00,"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
It is to me a source of unaffected satisfaction to meet the representatives of the States and the people in Congress assembled, as it will be to receive the aid of their combined wisdom in the administration of public affairs. In performing for the first time the duty imposed on me by the Constitution of giving to you information of the state of the Union and recommending to your consideration such measures as in my judgment are necessary and expedient, I am happy that I can congratulate you on the continued prosperity of our country. Under the blessings of Divine Providence and the benign influence of our free institutions, it stands before the world a spectacle of national happiness.
With our unexampled advancement in all the elements of national greatness, the affection of the people is confirmed for the Union of the States and for the doctrines of popular liberty which lie at the foundation of our Government.
It becomes us in humility to make our devout acknowledgments to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for the inestimable civil and religious blessings with which we are favored.
In calling the attention of Congress to our relations with foreign powers, I am gratified to be able to state that though with some of them there have existed since your last session serious causes of irritation and misunderstanding, yet no actual hostilities have taken place. Adopting the maxim in the conduct of our foreign affairs ""to ask nothing that is not right and submit to nothing that is wrong,"" it has been my anxious desire to preserve peace with all nations, but at the same time to be prepared to resist aggression and maintain all our just rights.
In pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress ""for annexing Texas to the United States,"" my predecessor, on the 3d day of March, 1845, elected to submit the first and second sections of that resolution to the Republic of Texas as an overture on the part of the United States for her admission as a State into our Union. This election I approved, and accordingly the charge' d'affaires of the United States in Texas, under instructions of the 10th of March, 1845, presented these sections of the resolution for the acceptance of that Republic. The executive government, the Congress, and the people of Texas in convention have successively complied with all the terms and conditions of the joint resolution. A constitution for the government of the State of Texas, formed by a convention of deputies, is herewith laid before Congress. It is well known, also, that the people of Texas at the polls have accepted the terms of annexation and ratified the constitution. I communicate to Congress the correspondence between the Secretary of State and our charge' d'affaires in Texas, and also the correspondence of the latter with the authorities of Texas, together with the official documents transmitted by him to his own Government. The terms of annexation which were offered by the United States having been accepted by Texas, the public faith of both parties is solemnly pledged to the compact of their union. Nothing remains to consummate the event but the passage of an act by Congress to admit the State of Texas into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States. Strong reasons exist why this should be done at an early period of the session. It will be observed that by the constitution of Texas the existing government is only continued temporarily till Congress can act, and that the third Monday of the present month is the day appointed for holding the first general election. On that day a governor, a lieutenant-governor, and both branches of the legislature will be chosen by the people. The President of Texas is required, immediately after the receipt of official information that the new State has been admitted into our Union by Congress, to convene the legislature, and upon its meeting the existing government will be superseded and the State government organized. Questions deeply interesting to Texas, in common with the other States, the extension of our revenue laws and judicial system over her people and territory, as well as measures of a local character, will claim the early attention of Congress, and therefore upon every principle of republican government she ought to be represented in that body without unnecessary delay. I can not too earnestly recommend prompt action on this important subject. As soon as the act to admit Texas as a State shall be passed the union of the two Republics will be consummated by their own voluntary consent.
This accession to our territory has been a bloodless achievement. No arm of force has been raised to produce the result. The sword has had no part in the victory. We have not sought to extend our territorial possessions by conquest, or our republican institutions over a reluctant people. It was the deliberate homage of each people to the great principle of our federative union. If we consider the extent of territory involved in the annexation, its prospective influence on America, the means by which it has been accomplished, springing purely from the choice of the people themselves to share the blessings of our union, the history of the world may be challenged to furnish a parallel. The jurisdiction of the United States, which at the formation of the Federal Constitution was bounded by the St. Marys on the Atlantic, has passed the capes of Florida and been peacefully extended to the Del Norte. In contemplating the grandeur of this event it is not to be forgotten that the result was achieved in despite of the diplomatic interference of European monarchies. Even France, the country which had been our ancient ally, the country which has a common interest with us in maintaining the freedom of the seas, the country which, by the cession of Louisiana, first opened to us access to the Gulf of Mexico, the country with which we have been every year drawing more and more closely the bonds of successful commerce, most unexpectedly, and to our unfeigned regret, took part in an effort to prevent annexation and to impose on Texas, as a condition of the recognition of her independence by Mexico, that she would never join herself to the United States. We may rejoice that the tranquil and pervading influence of the American principle of self-government was sufficient to defeat the purposes of British and French interference, and that the almost unanimous voice of the people of Texas has given to that interference a peaceful and effective rebuke. From this example European Governments may learn how vain diplomatic arts and intrigues must ever prove upon this continent against that system of self-government which seems natural to our soil, and which will ever resist foreign interference.
Toward Texas I do not doubt that a liberal and generous spirit will actuate Congress in all that concerns her interests and prosperity, and that she will never have cause to regret that she has united her ""lone star"" to our glorious constellation.
I regret to inform you that our relations with Mexico since your last session have not been of the amicable character which it is our desire to cultivate with all foreign nations. On the 6th day of March last the Mexican envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United States made a formal protest in the name of his Government against the joint resolution passed by Congress ""for the annexation of Texas to the United States,"" which he chose to regard as a violation of the rights of Mexico, and in consequence of it he demanded his passports. He was informed that the Government of the United States did not consider this joint resolution as a violation of any of the rights of Mexico, or that it afforded any just cause of offense to his Government; that the Republic of Texas was an independent power, owing no allegiance to Mexico and constituting no part of her territory or rightful sovereignty and jurisdiction. He was also assured that it was the sincere desire of this Government to maintain with that of Mexico relations of peace and good understanding. That functionary, however, notwithstanding these representations and assurances, abruptly terminated his mission and shortly afterwards left the country. Our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Mexico was refused all official intercourse with that Government, and, after remaining several months, by the permission of his own Government he returned to the United States. Thus, by the acts of Mexico, all diplomatic intercourse between the two countries was suspended.
Since that time Mexico has until recently occupied an attitude of hostility toward the United States--has been marshaling and organizing armies, issuing proclamations, and avowing the intention to make war on the United States, either by an open declaration or by invading Texas. Both the Congress and convention of the people of Texas invited this Government to send an army into that territory to protect and defend them against the menaced attack. The moment the terms of annexation offered by the United States were accepted by Texas the latter became so far a part of our own country as to make it our duty to afford such protection and defense. I therefore deemed it proper, as a precautionary measure, to order a strong squadron to the coasts of Mexico and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of Texas. Our Army was ordered to take position in the country between the Nueces and the Del Norte, and to repel any invasion of the Texan territory which might be attempted by the Mexican forces. Our squadron in the Gulf was ordered to cooperate with the Army. But though our Army and Navy were placed in a position to defend our own and the rights of Texas, they were ordered to commit no act of hostility against Mexico unless she declared war or was herself the aggressor by striking the first blow. The result has been that Mexico has made no aggressive movement, and our military and naval commanders have executed their orders with such discretion that the peace of the two Republics has not been disturbed. Texas had declared her independence and maintained it by her arms for more than nine years. She has had an organized government in successful operation during that period. Her separate existence as an independent state had been recognized by the United States and the principal powers of Europe. Treaties of commerce and navigation had been concluded with her by different nations, and it had become manifest to the whole world that any further attempt on the part of Mexico to conquer her or overthrow her Government would be vain. Even Mexico herself had become satisfied of this fact, and whilst the question of annexation was pending before the people of Texas during the past summer the Government of Mexico, by a formal act, agreed to recognize the independence of Texas on condition that she would not annex herself to any other power. The agreement to acknowledge the independence of Texas, whether with or without this condition, is conclusive against Mexico. The independence of Texas is a fact conceded by Mexico herself, and she had no right or authority to prescribe restrictions as to the form of government which Texas might afterwards choose to assume. But though Mexico can not complain of the United States on account of the annexation of Texas, it is to be regretted that serious causes of misunderstanding between the two countries continue to exist, growing out of unredressed injuries inflicted by the Mexican authorities and people on the persons and property of citizens of the United States through a long series of years. Mexico has admitted these injuries, but has neglected and refused to repair them. Such was the character of the wrongs and such the insults repeatedly offered to American citizens and the American flag by Mexico, in palpable violation of the laws of nations and the treaty between the two countries of the 5th of April, 1831, that they have been repeatedly brought to the notice of Congress by my predecessors. As early as the 6th of February, 1837, the President of the United States declared in a message to Congress that--
The length of time since some of the injuries have been committed, the repeated and unavailing applications for redress, the wanton character of some of the outrages upon the property and persons of our citizens, upon the officers and flag of the United States, independent of recent insults to this Government and people by the late extraordinary Mexican minister, would justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war.
He did not, however, recommend an immediate resort to this extreme measure, which, he declared, ""should not be used by just and generous nations, confiding in their strength for injuries committed, if it can be honorably avoided,"" but, in a spirit of forbearance, proposed that another demand be made on Mexico for that redress which had been so long and unjustly withheld. In these views committees of the two Houses of Congress, in reports made to their respective bodies, concurred. Since these proceedings more than eight years have elapsed, during which, in addition to the wrongs then complained of, others of an aggravated character have been committed on the persons and property of our citizens. A special agent was sent to Mexico in the summer of 1838 with full authority to make another and final demand for redress. The demand was made; the Mexican Government promised to repair the wrongs of which we complained, and after much delay a treaty of indemnity with that view was concluded between the two powers on the 11th of April, 1839, and was duly ratified by both Governments. By this treaty a joint commission was created to adjudicate and decide on the claims of American citizens on the Government of Mexico. The commission was organized at Washington on the 25th day of August, 1840. Their time was limited to eighteen months, at the expiration of which they had adjudicated and decided claims amounting to $2,026,139.68 in favor of citizens of the United States against the Mexican Government, leaving a large amount of claims undecided. Of the latter the American commissioners had decided in favor of our citizens claims amounting to $928,627.88, which were left unacted on by the umpire authorized by the treaty. Still further claims, amounting to between three and four millions of dollars, were submitted to the board too late to be considered, and were left undisposed of. The sum of $2,026,139.68, decided by the board, was a liquidated and ascertained debt due by Mexico to the claimants, and there was no justifiable reason for delaying its payment according to the terms of the treaty. It was not, however, paid. Mexico applied for further indulgence, and, in that spirit of liberality and forbearance which has ever marked the policy of the United States toward that Republic, the request was granted, and on the 30th of January, 1843, a new treaty was concluded. By this treaty it was provided that the interest due on the awards in favor of claimants under the convention of the 11th of April, 1839, should be paid out the 30th of April, 1843, and that--
The principal of the said awards and the interest accruing thereon shall be paid in five years, in equal installments every three months, the said term of five years to commence on the 30th day of April, 1843, aforesaid.
The interest due on the 30th day of April, 1843, and the three first of the twenty installments have been paid. Seventeen of these installments, remain unpaid, seven of which are now due.
The claims which were left undecided by the joint commission, amounting to more than $3,000,000, together with other claims for spoliations on the property of our citizens, were subsequently presented to the Mexican Government for payment, and were so far recognized that a treaty providing for their examination and settlement by a joint commission was concluded and signed at Mexico on the 20th day of November, 1843. This treaty was ratified by the United States with certain amendments to which no just exception could have been taken, but it has not yet received the ratification of the Mexican Government. In the meantime our citizens, who suffered great losses--and some of whom have been reduced from affluence to bankruptcy--are without remedy unless their rights be enforced by their Government. Such a continued and unprovoked series of wrongs could never have been tolerated by the United States had they been committed by one of the principal nations of Europe. Mexico was, however, a neighboring sister republic, which, following our example, had achieved her independence, and for whose success and prosperity all our sympathies were early enlisted. The United States were the first to recognize her independence and to receive her into the family of nations, and have ever been desirous of cultivating with her a good understanding. We have therefore borne the repeated wrongs she has committed with great patience, in the hope that a returning sense of justice would ultimately guide her councils and that we might, if possible, honorably avoid any hostile collision with her. Without the previous authority of Congress the Executive possessed no power to adopt or enforce adequate remedies for the injuries we had suffered, or to do more than to be prepared to repel the threatened aggression on the part of Mexico. After our Army and Navy had remained on the frontier and coasts of Mexico for many weeks without any hostile movement on her part, though her menaces were continued, I deemed it important to put an end, if possible, to this state of things. With this view I caused steps to be taken in the month of September last to ascertain distinctly and in an authentic form what the designs of the Mexican Government were--whether it was their intention to declare war, or invade Texas, or whether they were disposed to adjust and settle in an amicable manner the pending differences between the two countries. On the 9th of November an official answer was received that the Mexican Government consented to renew the diplomatic relations which had been suspended in March last, and for that purpose were willing to accredit a minister from the United States. With a sincere desire to preserve peace and restore relations of good understanding between the two Republics, I waived all ceremony as to the manner of renewing diplomatic intercourse between them, and, assuming the initiative, on the 10th of November a distinguished citizen of Louisiana was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Mexico, clothed with full powers to adjust and definitively settle all pending differences between the two countries, including those of boundary between Mexico and the State of Texas. The minister appointed has set out on his mission and is probably by this time near the Mexican capital. He has been instructed to bring the negotiation with which he is charged to a conclusion at the earliest practicable period, which it is expected will be in time to enable me to communicate the result to Congress during the present session. Until that result is known I forbear to recommend to Congress such ulterior measures of redress for the wrongs and injuries we have so long borne as it would have been proper to make had no such negotiation been instituted.
Congress appropriated at the last session the sum of $275,000 for the payment of the April and July installments of the Mexican indemnities for the year 1844:
Provided it shall be ascertained to the satisfaction of the American Government that said installments have been paid by the Mexican Government to the agent appointed by the United States to receive the same in such manner as to discharge all claim on the Mexican Government, and said agent to be delinquent in remitting the money to the United States.
The unsettled state of our relations with Mexico has involved this subject in much mystery. The first information in an authentic form from the agent of the United States, appointed under the Administration of my predecessor, was received at the State Department on the 9th of November last. This is contained in a letter, dated the 17th of October, addressed by him to one of our citizens then in Mexico with a view of having it communicated to that Department. From this it appears that the agent on the 20th of September, 1844, gave a receipt to the treasury of Mexico for the amount of the April and July installments of the indemnity. In the same communication, however, he asserts that he had not received a single dollar in cash, but that he holds such securities as warranted him at the time in giving the receipt, and entertains no doubt but that he will eventually obtain the money. As these installments appear never to have been actually paid by the Government of Mexico to the agent, and as that Government has not, therefore, been released so as to discharge the claim, I do not feel myself warranted in directing payment to be made to the claimants out of the Treasury without further legislation. Their case is undoubtedly one of much hardship, and it remains for Congress to decide whether any, and what, relief ought to be granted to them. Our minister to Mexico has been instructed to ascertain the facts of the case from the Mexican Government in an authentic and official form and report the result with as little delay as possible.
My attention was early directed to the negotiation which on the 4th of March last I found pending at Washington between the United States and Great Britain on the subject of the Oregon Territory. Three several attempts had been previously made to settle the questions in dispute between the two countries by negotiation upon the principle of compromise, but each had proved unsuccessful. These negotiations took place at London in the years 1818, 1824, and 1826--the two first under the Administration of Mr. Monroe and the last under that of Mr. Adams. The negotiation of 1818, having failed to accomplish its object, resulted in the convention of the 20th of October of that year.
By the third article of that convention it was--
Agreed that any country that may be claimed by either party on the northwest coast of America westward of the Stony Mountains shall, together with its harbors, bays, and creeks, and the navigation of all rivers within the same, be free and open for the term of ten years from the date of the signature of the present convention to the vessels, citizens, and subjects of the two powers; it being well understood that this agreement is not to be construed to the prejudice of any claim which either of the two high contracting parties may have to any part of the said country, nor shall it be taken to affect the claims of any other power or state to any part of the said country, the only object of the high contracting parties in that respect being to prevent disputes and differences amongst themselves.
The negotiation of 1824 was productive of no result, and the convention of 1818 was left unchanged.
The negotiation of 1826, having also failed to effect an adjustment by compromise, resulted in the convention of August 6, 1827, by which it was agreed to continue in force for an indefinite period the provisions of the third article of the convention of the 20th of October, 1818; and it was further provided that--
It shall be competent, however, to either of the contracting parties, in case either should think fit, at any time after the 20th of October, 1828, on giving due notice of twelve months to the other contracting party, to annul and abrogate this convention; and it shall in such case be accordingly entirely annulled and abrogated after the expiration of the said term of notice.
In these attempts to adjust the controversy the parallel of the forty-ninth degree of north latitude had been offered by the United States to Great Britain, and in those of 1818 and 1826, with a further concession of the free navigation of the Columbia River south of that latitude. The parallel of the forty-ninth degree from the Rocky Mountains to its intersection with the northeasternmost branch of the Columbia, and thence down the channel of that river to the sea, had been offered by Great Britain, with an addition of a small detached territory north of the Columbia. Each of these propositions had been rejected by the parties respectively. In October, 1843, the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States in London was authorized to make a similar offer to those made in 1818 and 1826. Thus stood the question when the negotiation was shortly afterwards transferred to Washington, and on the 23d of August, 1844, was formally opened under the direction of my immediate predecessor. Like all the previous negotiations, it was based upon principles of ""compromise,"" and the avowed purpose of the parties was ""to treat of the respective claims of the two countries to the Oregon Territory with the view to establish a permanent boundary between them westward of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.""
Accordingly, on the 26th of August, 1844, the British plenipotentiary offered to divide the Oregon Territory by the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude from the Rocky Mountains to the point of its intersection with the northeasternmost branch of the Columbia River, and thence down that river to the sea, leaving the free navigation of the river to be enjoyed in common by both parties, the country south of this line to belong to the United States and that north of it to Great Britain. At the same time he proposed in addition to yield to the United States a detached territory north of the Columbia extending along the Pacific and the Straits of Fuca from Bulfinchs Harbor, inclusive, to Hoods Canal, and to make free to the United States any port or ports south of latitude 49&deg; which they might desire, either on the mainland or on Quadra and Vancouvers Island. With the exception of the free ports, this was the same offer which had been made by the British and rejected by the American Government in the negotiation of 1826. This proposition was properly rejected by the American plenipotentiary on the day it was submitted. This was the only proposition of compromise offered by the British plenipotentiary. The proposition on the part of Great Britain having been rejected, the British plenipotentiary requested that a proposal should be made by the United States for ""an equitable adjustment of the question."" When I came into office I found this to be the state of the negotiation. Though entertaining the settled conviction that the British pretensions of title could not be maintained to any portion of the Oregon Territory upon any principle of public law recognized by nations, yet in deference to what had been done by my predecessors, and especially in consideration that propositions of compromise had been thrice made by two preceding Administrations to adjust the question on the parallel of 49&deg;, and in two of them yielding to Great Britain the free navigation of the Columbia, and that the pending negotiation had been commenced on the basis of compromise, I deemed it to be my duty not abruptly to break it off. In consideration, too, that under the conventions of 1818 and 1827 the citizens and subjects of the two powers held a joint occupancy of the country, I was induced to make another effort to settle this long-pending controversy in the spirit of moderation which had given birth to the renewed discussion. A proposition was accordingly made, which was rejected by the British plenipotentiary, who, without submitting any other proposition, suffered the negotiation on his part to drop, expressing his trust that the United States would offer what he saw fit to call ""some further proposal for the settlement of the Oregon question more consistent with fairness and equity and with the reasonable expectations of the British Government."" The proposition thus offered and rejected repeated the offer of the parallel of 49&deg; of north latitude, which had been made by two preceding Administrations, but without proposing to surrender to Great Britain, as they had done, the free navigation of the Columbia River. The right of any foreign power to the free navigation of any of our rivers through the heart of our country was one which I was unwilling to concede. It also embraced a provision to make free to Great Britain any port or ports on the cap of Quadra and Vancouvers Island south of this parallel. Had this been a new question, coming under discussion for the first time, this proposition would not have been made. The extraordinary and wholly inadmissible demands of the British Government and the rejection of the proposition made in deference alone to what had been done by my predecessors and the implied obligation which their acts seemed to impose afford satisfactory evidence that no compromise which the United States ought to accept can be effected. With this conviction the proposition of compromise which had been made and rejected was by my direction subsequently withdrawn and our title to the whole Oregon Territory asserted, and, as is believed, maintained by irrefragable facts and arguments.
The civilized world will see in these proceedings a spirit of liberal concession on the part of the United States, and this Government will be relieved from all responsibility which may follow the failure to settle the controversy.
It will become proper for Congress to determine what legislation they can in the meantime adopt without violating this convention. Beyond all question the protection of our laws and our jurisdiction, civil and criminal, ought to be immediately extended over our citizens in Oregon. They have had just cause to complain of our long neglect in this particular, and have in consequence been compelled for their own security and protection to establish a provisional government for themselves. Strong in their allegiance and ardent in their attachment to the United States, they have been thus cast upon their own resources. They are anxious that our laws should be extended over them, and I recommend that this be done by Congress with as little delay as possible in the full extent to which the British Parliament have proceeded in regard to British subjects in that Territory by their act of July 2, 1821, ""for regulating the fur trade and establishing a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain parts of North America."" By this act Great Britain extended her laws and jurisdiction, civil and criminal, over her subjects engaged in the fur trade in that Territory. By it the courts of the Province of Upper Canada were empowered to take cognizance of causes civil and criminal. Justices of the peace and other judicial officers were authorized to be appointed in Oregon with power to execute all process issuing from the courts of that Province, and to ""sit and hold courts of record for the trial of criminal offenses and misdemeanors"" not made the subject of capital punishment, and also of civil cases where the cause of action shall not ""exceed in value the amount or sum of lbs. 200.""
Subsequent to the date of this act of Parliament a grant was made from the ""British Crown"" to the Hudsons Bay Company of the exclusive trade with the Indian tribes in the Oregon Territory, subject to a reservation that it shall not operate to the exclusion ""of the subjects of any foreign states who, under or by force of any convention for the time being between us and such foreign states, respectively, may be entitled to and shall be engaged in the said trade."" It is much to be regretted that while under this act British subjects have enjoyed the protection of British laws and British judicial tribunals throughout the whole of Oregon, American citizens in the same Territory have enjoyed no such protection from their Government. At the same time, the result illustrates the character of our people and their institutions. In spite of this neglect they have multiplied, and their number is rapidly increasing in that Territory. They have made no appeal to arms, but have peacefully fortified themselves in their new homes by the adoption of republican institutions for themselves, furnishing another example of the truth that self-government is inherent in the American breast and must prevail. It is due to them that they should be embraced and protected by our laws. It is deemed important that our laws regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains should be extended to such tribes as dwell beyond them. The increasing emigration to Oregon and the care and protection which is due from the Government to its citizens in that distant region make it our duty, as it is our interest, to cultivate amicable relations with the Indian tribes of that Territory. For this purpose I recommend that provision be made for establishing an Indian agency and such subagencies as may be deemed necessary beyond the Rocky Mountains.
For the protection of emigrants whilst on their way to Oregon against the attacks of the Indian tribes occupying the country through which they pass, I recommend that a suitable number of stockades and blockhouse forts be erected along the usual route between our frontier settlements on the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, and that an adequate force of mounted riflemen be raised to guard and protect them on their journey. The immediate adoption of these recommendations by Congress will not violate the provisions of the existing treaty. It will be doing nothing more for American citizens than British laws have long since done for British subjects in the same territory.
It requires several months to perform the voyage by sea from the Atlantic States to Oregon, and although we have a large number of whale ships in the Pacific, but few of them afford an opportunity of interchanging intelligence without great delay between our settlements in that distant region and the United States. An overland mail is believed to be entirely practicable, and the importance of establishing such a mail at least once a month is submitted to the favorable consideration of Congress.
It is submitted to the wisdom of Congress to determine whether at their present session, and until after the expiration of the year's notice, any other measures may be adopted consistently with the convention of 1827 for the security of our rights and the government and protection of our citizens in Oregon. That it will ultimately be wise and proper to make liberal grants of land to the patriotic pioneers who amidst privations and dangers lead the way through savage tribes inhabiting the vast wilderness intervening between our frontier settlements and Oregon, and who cultivate and are ever ready to defend the soil, I am fully satisfied. To doubt whether they will obtain such grants as soon as the convention between the United States and Great Britain shall have ceased to exist would be to doubt the justice of Congress; but, pending the year's notice, it is worthy of consideration whether a stipulation to this effect may be made consistently with the spirit of that convention.
The recommendations which I have made as to the best manner of securing our rights in Oregon are submitted to Congress with great deference. Should they in their wisdom devise any other mode better calculated to accomplish the same object, it shall meet with my hearty concurrence.
At the end of the year's notice, should Congress think it proper to make provision for giving that notice, we shall have reached a period when the national rights in Oregon must either be abandoned or firmly maintained. That they can not be abandoned without a sacrifice of both national honor and interest is too clear to admit of doubt.
Oregon is a part of the North American continent, to which, it is confidently affirmed, the title of the United States is the best now in existence. For the grounds on which that title rests I refer you to the correspondence of the late and present Secretary of State with the British plenipotentiary during the negotiation. The British proposition of compromise, which would make the Columbia the line south of 49&deg;, with a trifling addition of detached territory to the United States north of that river, and would leave on the British side two-thirds of the whole Oregon Territory, including the free navigation of the Columbia and all the valuable harbors on the Pacific, can never for a moment be entertained by the United States without an abandonment of their just and dear territorial rights, their own self-respect, and the national honor. For the information of Congress, I communicate herewith the correspondence which took place between the two Governments during the late negotiation.
The rapid extension of our settlements over our territories heretofore unoccupied, the addition of new States to our Confederacy, the expansion of free principles, and our rising greatness as a nation are attracting the attention of the powers of Europe, and lately the doctrine has been broached in some of them of a ""balance of power"" on this continent to check our advancement. The United States, sincerely desirous of preserving relations of good understanding with all nations, can not in silence permit any European interference on the North American continent, and should any such interference be attempted will be ready to resist it at any and all hazards.
It is well known to the American people and to all nations that this Government has never interfered with the relations subsisting between other governments. We have never made ourselves parties to their wars or their alliances; we have not sought their territories by conquest; we have not mingled with parties in their domestic struggles; and believing our own form of government to be the best, we have never attempted to propagate it by intrigues, by diplomacy, or by force. We may claim on this continent a like exemption from European interference. The nations of America are equally sovereign and independent with those of Europe. They possess the same rights, independent of all foreign interposition, to make war, to conclude peace, and to regulate their internal affairs. The people of the United States can not, therefore, view with indifference attempts of European powers to interfere with the independent action of the nations on this continent. The American system of government is entirely different from that of Europe. Jealousy among the different sovereigns of Europe, lest any one of them might become too powerful for the rest, has caused them anxiously to desire the establishment of what they term the ""balance of power."" It can not be permitted to have any application on the North American continent, and especially to the United States. We must ever maintain the principle that the people of this continent alone have the right to decide their own destiny. Should any portion of them, constituting an independent state, propose to unite themselves with our Confederacy, this will be a question for them and us to determine without any foreign interposition. We can never consent that European powers shall interfere to prevent such a union because it might disturb the ""balance of power"" which they may desire to maintain upon this continent. Near a quarter of a century ago the principle was distinctly announced to the world, in the annual message of one of my predecessors, that--
The American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for colonization by any European powers.
This principle will apply with greatly increased force should any European power attempt to establish any new colony in North America. In the existing circumstances of the world the present is deemed a proper occasion to reiterate and reaffirm the principle avowed by Mr. Monroe and to state my cordial concurrence in its wisdom and sound policy. The reassertion of this principle, especially in reference to North America, is at this day but the promulgation of a policy which no European power should cherish the disposition to resist. Existing rights of every European nation should be respected, but it is due alike to our safety and our interests that the efficient protection of our laws should be extended over our whole territorial limits, and that it should be distinctly announced to the world as our settled policy that no future European colony or dominion shall with our consent be planted or established on any part of the North American continent.
A question has recently arisen under the tenth article of the subsisting treaty between the United States and Prussia. By this article the consuls of the two countries have the right to sit as judges and arbitrators ""in such differences as may arise between the captains and crews of the vessels belonging to the nation whose interests are committed to their charge without the interference of the local authorities, unless the conduct of the crews or of the captain should disturb the order or tranquillity of the country, or the said consuls should require their assistance to cause their decisions to be carried into effect or supported.""
The Prussian consul at New Bedford in June, 1844, applied to Mr. Justice Story to carry into effect a decision made by him between the captain and crew of the Prussian ship Borussia, but the request was refused on the ground that without previous legislation by Congress the judiciary did not possess the power to give effect to this article of the treaty. The Prussian Government, through their minister here, have complained of this violation of the treaty, and have asked the Government of the United States to adopt the necessary measures to prevent similar violations hereafter. Good faith to Prussia, as well as to other nations with whom we have similar treaty stipulations, requires that these should be faithfully observed. I have deemed it proper, therefore, to lay the subject before Congress and to recommend such legislation as may be necessary to give effect to these treaty obligations.
By virtue of an arrangement made between the Spanish Government and that of the United States in December, 1831, American vessels, since the 29th of April, 1832, have been admitted to entry in the ports of Spain, including those of the Balearic and Canary islands, on payment of the same tonnage duty of 5 cents per ton, as though they had been Spanish vessels; and this whether our vessels arrive in Spain directly from the United States or indirectly from any other country. When Congress, by the act of 13th July, 1832, gave effect to this arrangement between the two Governments, they confined the reduction of tonnage duty merely to Spanish vessels ""coming from a port in Spain,"" leaving the former discriminating duty to remain against such vessels coming from a port in any other country. It is manifestly unjust that whilst American vessels arriving in the ports of Spain from other countries pay no more duty than Spanish vessels, Spanish vessels arriving in the ports of the United States from other countries should be subjected to heavy discriminating tonnage duties. This is neither equality nor reciprocity, and is in violation of the arrangement concluded in December, 1831, between the two countries. The Spanish Government have made repeated and earnest remonstrances against this inequality, and the favorable attention of Congress has been several times invoked to the subject by my predecessors. I recommend, as an act of justice to Spain, that this inequality be removed by Congress and that the discriminating duties which have been levied under the act of the 13th of July, 1832, on Spanish vessels coming to the United States from any other foreign country be refunded. This recommendation does not embrace Spanish vessels arriving in the United States from Cuba and Porto Rico, which will still remain subject to the provisions of the act of June 30, 1834, concerning tonnage duty on such vessels. By the act of the 14th of July, 1832, coffee was exempted from duty altogether. This exemption was universal, without reference to the country where it was produced or the national character of the vessel in which it was imported. By the tariff act of the 30th of August, 1842, this exemption from duty was restricted to coffee imported in American vessels from the place of its production, whilst coffee imported under all other circumstances was subjected to a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem. Under this act and our existing treaty with the King of the Netherlands Java coffee imported from the European ports of that Kingdom into the United States, whether in Dutch or American vessels, now pays this rate of duty. The Government of the Netherlands complains that such a discriminating duty should have been imposed on coffee the production of one of its colonies, and which is chiefly brought from Java to the ports of that Kingdom and exported from thence to foreign countries. Our trade with the Netherlands is highly beneficial to both countries and our relations with them have ever been of the most friendly character. Under all the circumstances of the case, I recommend that this discrimination should be abolished and that the coffee of Java imported from the Netherlands be placed upon the same footing with that imported directly from Brazil and other countries where it is produced.
Under the eighth section of the tariff act of the 30th of August, 1842, a duty of 15 cents per gallon was imposed on port wine in casks, while on the red wines of several other countries, when imported in casks, a duty of only 6 cents per gallon was imposed. This discrimination, so far as regarded the port wine of Portugal, was deemed a violation of our treaty with that power, which provides that--
No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States of America of any article the growth, produce, or manufacture of the Kingdom and possessions of Portugal than such as are or shall be payable on the like article being the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country.
Accordingly, to give effect to the treaty as well as to the intention of Congress, expressed in a proviso to the tariff act itself, that nothing therein contained should be so construed as to interfere with subsisting treaties with foreign nations, a Treasury circular was issued on the 16th of July, 1844, which, among other things, declared the duty on the port wine of Portugal, in casks, under the existing laws and treaty to be 6 cents per gallon, and directed that the excess of duties which had been collected on such wine should be refunded. By virtue of another clause in the same section of the act it is provided that all imitations of port or any other wines ""shall be subject to the duty provided for the genuine article."" Imitations of port wine, the production of France, are imported to some extent into the United States, and the Government of that country now claims that under a correct construction of the act these imitations ought not to pay a higher duty than that imposed upon the original port wine of Portugal. It appears to me to be unequal and unjust that French imitations of port wine should be subjected to a duty of 15 cents, while the more valuable article from Portugal should pay a duty of 6 cents only per gallon. I therefore recommend to Congress such legislation as may be necessary to correct the inequality.
The late President, in his annual message of December last, recommended an appropriation to satisfy the claims of the Texan Government against the United States, which had been previously adjusted so far as the powers of the Executive extend. These claims arose out of the act of disarming a body of Texan troops under the command of Major Snively by an officer in the service of the United States, acting under the orders of our Government, and the forcible entry into the custom-house at Bryarlys Landing, on Red River, by certain citizens of the United States and taking away therefrom the goods seized by the collector of the customs as forfeited under the laws of Texas. This was a liquidated debt ascertained to be due to Texas when an independent state. Her acceptance of the terms of annexation proposed by the United States does not discharge or invalidate the claim. I recommend that provision be made for its payment.
The commissioner appointed to China during the special session of the Senate in March last shortly afterwards set out on his mission in the United States ship Columbus. On arriving at Rio de Janeiro on his passage the state of his health had become so critical that by the advice of his medical attendants he returned to the United States early in the month of October last. Commodore Biddle, commanding the East India Squadron, proceeded on his voyage in the Columbus, and was charged by the commissioner with the duty of exchanging with the proper authorities the ratifications of the treaty lately concluded with the Emperor of China. Since the return of the commissioner to the United States his health has been much improved, and he entertains the confident belief that he will soon be able to proceed on his mission.
Unfortunately, differences continue to exist among some of the nations of South America which, following our example, have established their independence, while in others internal dissensions prevail. It is natural that our sympathies should be warmly enlisted for their welfare; that we should desire that all controversies between them should be amicably adjusted and their Governments administered in a manner to protect the rights and promote the prosperity of their people. It is contrary, however, to our settled policy to interfere in their controversies, whether external or internal.
I have thus adverted to all the subjects connected with our foreign relations to which I deem it necessary to call your attention. Our policy is not only peace with all, but good will toward all the powers of the earth. While we are just to all, we require that all shall be just to us. Excepting the differences with Mexico and Great Britain, our relations with all civilized nations are of the most satisfactory character. It is hoped that in this enlightened age these differences may be amicably adjusted.
The Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report to Congress will communicate a full statement of the condition of our finances. The imports for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were of the value of $117,254,564, of which the amount exported was $15,346,830, leaving a balance of $101,907,734 for domestic consumption. The exports for the same year were of the value of $114,646,606, of which the amount of domestic articles was $99,299,776. The receipts into the Treasury during the same year were $29,769,133.56, of which there were derived from customs $27,528,122.70, from sales of public lands $2,077,022.30, and from incidental and miscellaneous sources $163,998.56. The expenditures for the same period were $29,968,206.98, of which $8,588,157.62 were applied to the payment of the public debt. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last was $7,658,306.22. The amount of the public debt remaining unpaid on the 1st of October last was $17,075,445.52. Further payments of the public debt would have been made, in anticipation of the period of its reimbursement under the authority conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury by the acts of July 21, 1841, and of April 15, 1842, and March 3, 1843, had not the unsettled state of our relations with Mexico menaced hostile collision with that power. In view of such a contingency it was deemed prudent to retain in the Treasury an amount unusually large for ordinary purposes.
A few years ago our whole national debt growing out of the Revolution and the War of 1812 with Great Britain was extinguished, and we presented to the world the rare and noble spectacle of a great and growing people who had fully discharged every obligation. Since that time the existing debt has been contracted, and, small as it is in comparison with the similar burdens of most other nations, it should be extinguished at the earliest practicable period. Should the state of the country permit, and especially if our foreign relations interpose no obstacle, it is contemplated to apply all the moneys in the Treasury as they accrue, beyond what is required for the appropriations by Congress, to its liquidation. I cherish the hope of soon being able to congratulate the country on its recovering once more the lofty position which it so recently occupied. Our country, which exhibits to the world the benefits of self-government, in developing all the sources of national prosperity owes to mankind the permanent example of a nation free from the blighting influence of a public debt.
The attention of Congress is invited to the importance of making suitable modifications and reductions of the rates of duty imposed by our present tariff laws. The object of imposing duties on imports should be to raise revenue to pay the necessary expenses of Government. Congress may undoubtedly, in the exercise of a sound discretion, discriminate in arranging the rates of duty on different articles, but the discriminations should be within the revenue standard and be made with the view to raise money for the support of Government.
It becomes important to understand distinctly what is meant by a revenue standard the maximum of which should not be exceeded in the rates of duty imposed. It is conceded, and experience proves, that duties may be laid so high as to diminish or prohibit altogether the importation of any given article, and thereby lessen or destroy the revenue which at lower rates would be derived from its importation. Such duties exceed the revenue rates and are not imposed to raise money for the support of Government. If Congress levy a duty for revenue of 1 per cent on a given article, it will produce a given amount of money to the Treasury and will incidentally and necessarily afford protection or advantage to the amount of 1 per cent to the home manufacturer of a similar or like article over the importer. If the duty be raised to 10 per cent, it will produce a greater amount of money and afford greater protection. If it be still raised to 20, 25, or 30 per cent, and if as it is raised the revenue derived from it is found to be increased, the protection or advantage will also be increased; but if it be raised to 31 per cent, and it is found that the revenue produced at that rate is less than at 30 per cent, it ceases to be a revenue duty. The precise point in the ascending scale of duties at which it is ascertained from experience that the revenue is greatest is the maximum rate of duty which can be laid for the bona fide purpose of collecting money for the support of Government. To raise the duties higher than that point, and thereby diminish the amount collected, is to levy them for protection merely, and not for revenue. As long, then, as Congress may gradually increase the rate of duty on a given article, and the revenue is increased by such increase of duty, they are within the revenue standard. When they go beyond that point, and as they increase the duties, the revenue is diminished or destroyed; the act ceases to have for its object the raising of money to support Government, but is for protection merely. It does not follow that Congress should levy the highest duty on all articles of import which they will bear within the revenue standard, for such rates would probably produce a much larger amount than the economical administration of the Government would require. Nor does it follow that the duties on all articles should be at the same or a horizontal rate. Some articles will bear a much higher revenue duty than others. Below the maximum of the revenue standard Congress may and ought to discriminate in the rates imposed, taking care so to adjust them on different articles as to produce in the aggregate the amount which, when added to the proceeds of the sales of public lands, may be needed to pay the economical expenses of the Government.
In levying a tariff of duties Congress exercise the taxing power, and for purposes of revenue may select the objects of taxation. They may exempt certain articles altogether and permit their importation free of duty. On others they may impose low duties. In these classes should be embraced such articles of necessity as are in general use, and especially such as are consumed by the laborer and poor as well as by the wealthy citizen. Care should be taken that all the great interests of the country, including manufactures, agriculture, commerce, navigation, and the mechanic arts, should, as far as may be practicable, derive equal advantages from the incidental protection which a just system of revenue duties may afford. Taxation, direct or indirect, is a burden, and it should be so imposed as to operate as equally as may be on all classes in the proportion of their ability to bear it. To make the taxing power an actual benefit to one class necessarily increases the burden of the others beyond their proportion, and would be manifestly unjust. The terms ""protection to domestic industry"" are of popular import, but they should apply under a just system to all the various branches of industry in our country. The farmer or planter who toils yearly in his fields is engaged in ""domestic industry,"" and is as much entitled to have his labor ""protected"" as the manufacturer, the man of commerce, the navigator, or the mechanic, who are engaged also in ""domestic industry"" in their different pursuits. The joint labors of all these classes constitute the aggregate of the ""domestic industry"" of the nation, and they are equally entitled to the nation's ""protection."" No one of them can justly claim to be the exclusive recipient of ""protection,"" which can only be afforded by increasing burdens on the ""domestic industry"" of the others.
If these views be correct, it remains to inquire how far the tariff act of 1842 is consistent with them. That many of the provisions of that act are in violation of the cardinal principles here laid down all must concede. The rates of duty imposed by it on some articles are prohibitory and on others so high as greatly to diminish importations and to produce a less amount of revenue than would be derived from lower rates. They operate as ""protection merely"" to one branch of ""domestic industry"" by taxing other branches.
By the introduction of minimums, or assumed and false values, and by the imposition of specific duties the injustice and inequality of the act of 1842 in its practical operations on different classes and pursuits are seen and felt. Many of the oppressive duties imposed by it under the operation of these principles range from 1 per cent to more than 200 per cent. They are prohibitory on some articles and partially so on others, and bear most heavily on articles of common necessity and but lightly on articles of luxury. It is so framed that much the greatest burden which it imposes is thrown on labor and the poorer classes, who are least able to bear it, while it protects capital and exempts the rich from paying their just proportion of the taxation required for the support of Government. While it protects the capital of the wealthy manufacturer and increases his profits, it does not benefit the operatives or laborers in his employment, whose wages have not been increased by it. Articles of prime necessity or of coarse quality and low price, used by the masses of the people, are in many instances subjected by it to heavy taxes, while articles of finer quality and higher price, or of luxury, which can be used only by the opulent, are lightly taxed. It imposes heavy and unjust burdens on the farmer, the planter, the commercial man, and those of all other pursuits except the capitalist who has made his investments in manufactures. All the great interests of the country are not as nearly as may be practicable equally protected by it.
The Government in theory knows no distinction of persons or classes, and should not bestow upon some favors and privileges which all others may not enjoy. It was the purpose of its illustrious founders to base the institutions which they reared upon the great and unchanging principles of justice and equity, conscious that if administered in the spirit in which they were conceived they would be felt only by the benefits which they diffused, and would secure for themselves a defense in the hearts of the people more powerful than standing armies and all the means and appliances invented to sustain governments founded in injustice and oppression.
The well-known fact that the tariff act of 1842 was passed by a majority of one vote in the Senate and two in the House of Representatives, and that some of those who felt themselves constrained, under the peculiar circumstances existing at the time, to vote in its favor, proclaimed its defects and expressed their determination to aid in its modification on the first opportunity, affords strong and conclusive evidence that it was not intended to be permanent, and of the expediency and necessity of its thorough revision.
In recommending to Congress a reduction of the present rates of duty and a revision and modification of the act of 1842, I am far from entertaining opinions unfriendly to the manufacturers. On the contrary, I desire to see them prosperous as far as they can be so without imposing unequal burdens on other interests. The advantage under any system of indirect taxation, even within the revenue standard, must be in favor of the manufacturing interest, and of this no other interest will complain.
I recommend to Congress the abolition of the minimum principle, or assumed, arbitrary, and false values, and of specific duties, and the substitution in their place of ad valorem duties as the fairest and most equitable indirect tax which can be imposed. By the ad valorem principle all articles are taxed according to their cost or value, and those which are of inferior quality or of small cost bear only the just proportion of the tax with those which are of superior quality or greater cost. The articles consumed by all are taxed at the same rate. A system of ad valorem revenue duties, with proper discriminations and proper guards against frauds in collecting them, it is not doubted will afford ample incidental advantages to the manufacturers and enable them to derive as great profits as can be derived from any other regular business. It is believed that such a system strictly within the revenue standard will place the manufacturing interests on a stable footing and inure to their permanent advantage, while it will as nearly as may be practicable extend to all the great interests of the country the incidental protection which can be afforded by our revenue laws. Such a system, when once firmly established, would be permanent, and not be subject to the constant complaints, agitations, and changes which must ever occur when duties are not laid for revenue, but for the ""protection merely"" of a favored interest.
In the deliberations of Congress on this subject it is hoped that a spirit of mutual concession and compromise between conflicting interests may prevail, and that the result of their labors may be crowned with the happiest consequences.
By the Constitution of the United States it is provided that ""no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law."" A public treasury was undoubtedly contemplated and intended to be created, in which the public money should be kept from the period of collection until needed for public uses. In the collection and disbursement of the public money no agencies have ever been employed by law except such as were appointed by the Government, directly responsible to it and under its control. The safe-keeping of the public money should be confided to a public treasury created by law and under like responsibility and control. It is not to be imagined that the framers of the Constitution could have intended that a treasury should be created as a place of deposit and safe-keeping of the public money which was irresponsible to the Government. The first Congress under the Constitution, by the act of the 2d of September, 1789, ""to establish the Treasury Department,"" provided for the appointment of a Treasurer, and made it his duty ""to receive and keep the moneys of the United States"" and ""at all times to submit to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller, or either of them, the inspection of the moneys in his hands.""
That banks, national or State, could not have been intended to be used as a substitute for the Treasury spoken of in the Constitution as keepers of the public money is manifest from the fact that at that time there was no national bank, and but three or four State banks, of limited Capital, existed in the country. Their employment as depositories was at first resorted to a limited extent, but with no avowed intention of continuing them permanently in place of the Treasury of the Constitution. When they were afterwards from time to time employed, it was from motives of supposed convenience. Our experience has shown that when banking corporations have been the keepers of the public money, and been thereby made in effect the Treasury, the Government can have no guaranty that it can command the use of its own money for public purposes. The late Bank of the United States proved to be faithless. The State banks which were afterwards employed were faithless. But a few years ago, with millions of public money in their keeping, the Government was brought almost to bankruptcy and the public credit seriously impaired because of their inability or indisposition to pay on demand to the public creditors in the only currency recognized by the Constitution. Their failure occurred in a period of peace, and great inconvenience and loss were suffered by the public from it. Had the country been involved in a foreign war, that inconvenience and loss would have been much greater, and might have resulted in extreme public calamity. The public money should not be mingled with the private funds of banks or individuals or be used for private purposes. When it is placed in banks for safe-keeping, it is in effect loaned to them without interest, and is loaned by them upon interest to the borrowers from them. The public money is converted into banking capital, and is used and loaned out for the private profit of bank stockholders, and when called for, as was the case in 1837, it may be in the pockets of the borrowers from the banks instead of being in the public Treasury contemplated by the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution could never have intended that the money paid into the Treasury should be thus converted to private use and placed beyond the control of the Government.
Banks which hold the public money are often tempted by a desire of gain to extend their loans, increase their circulation, and thus stimulate, if not produce, a spirit of speculation and extravagance which sooner or later must result in ruin to thousands. If the public money be not permitted to be thus used, but be kept in the Treasure and paid out to the public creditors in gold and silver, the temptation afforded by its deposit with banks to an undue expansion of their business would be checked, while the amount of the constitutional currency left in circulation would be enlarged by its employment in the public collections and disbursements, and the banks themselves would in consequence be found in a safer and sounder condition. At present State banks are employed as depositories, but without adequate regulation of law whereby the public money can be secured against the casualties and excesses, revulsions, suspensions, and defalcations to which from overissues, overtrading, an inordinate desire for gain, or other causes they are constantly exposed. The Secretary of the Treasury has in all cases when it was practicable taken collateral security for the amount which they hold, by the pledge of stocks of the United States or such of the States as were in good credit. Some of the deposit banks have given this description of security and others have declined to do so.
Entertaining the opinion that ""the separation of the moneys of the Government from banking institutions is indispensable for the safety of the funds of the Government and the rights of the people,"" I recommend to Congress that provision be made by law for such separation, and that a constitutional treasury be created for the safe-keeping of the public money. The constitutional treasury recommended is designed as a secure depository for the public money, without any power to make loans or discounts or to issue any paper whatever as a currency or circulation. I can not doubt that such a treasury as was contemplated by the Constitution should be independent of all banking corporations. The money of the people should be kept in the Treasury of the people created by law, and be in the custody of agents of the people chosen by themselves according to the forms of the Constitution--agents who are directly responsible to the Government, who are under adequate bonds and oaths, and who are subject to severe punishments for any embezzlement, private use, or misapplication of the public funds, and for any failure in other respects to perform their duties. To say that the people or their Government are incompetent or not to be trusted with the custody of their own money in their own Treasury, provided by themselves, but must rely on the presidents, cashiers, and stockholders of banking corporations, not appointed by them nor responsible to them, would be to concede that they are incompetent for self-government.
In recommending the establishment of a constitutional treasury in which the public money shall be kept, I desire that adequate provision be made by law for its safety and that all Executive discretion or control over it shall be removed, except such as may be necessary in directing its disbursement in pursuance of appropriations made by law.
Under our present land system, limiting the minimum price at which the public lands can be entered to $1.25 per acre, large quantities of lands of inferior quality remain unsold because they will not command that price. From the records of the General Land Office it appears that of the public lands remaining unsold in the several States and Territories in which they are situated, 39,105,577 acres have been in the market subject to entry more than twenty years, 49,638,644 acres for more than fifteen years, 73,074,600 acres for more than ten years, and 106,176,961 acres for more than five years. Much the largest portion of these lands will continue to be unsalable at the minimum price at which they are permitted to be sold so long as large territories of lands from which the more valuable portions have not been selected are annually brought into market by the Government. With the view to the sale and settlement of these inferior lands, I recommend that the price be graduated and reduced below the present minimum rate, confining the sales at the reduced prices to settlers and cultivators, in limited quantities. If graduated and reduced in price for a limited term to $1 per acre, and after the expiration of that period for a second and third term to lower rates, a large portion of these lands would be purchased, and many worthy citizens who are unable to pay higher rates could purchase homes for themselves and their families. By adopting the policy of graduation and reduction of price these inferior lands will be sold for their real value, while the States in which they lie will be freed from the inconvenience, if not injustice, to which they are subjected in consequence of the United States continuing to own large quantities of the public lands within their borders not liable to taxation for the support of their local governments.
I recommend the continuance of the policy of granting preemptions in its most liberal extent to all those who have settled or may hereafter settle on the public lands, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, to which the Indian title may have been extinguished at the time of settlement. It has been found by experience that in consequence of combinations of purchasers and other causes a very small quantity of the public lands, when sold at public auction, commands a higher price than the minimum rates established by law. The settlers on the public lands are, however, but rarely able to secure their homes and improvements at the public sales at that rate, because these combinations, by means of the capital they command and their superior ability to purchase, render it impossible for the settler to compete with them in the market. By putting down all competition these combinations of capitalists and speculators are usually enabled to purchase the lands, including the improvements of the settlers, at the minimum price of the Government, and either turn them out of their homes or extort from them, according to their ability to pay, double or quadruple the amount paid for them to the Government. It is to the enterprise and perseverance of the hardy pioneers of the West, who penetrate the wilderness with their families, suffer the dangers, the privations, and hardships attending the settlement of a new country, and prepare the way for the body of emigrants who in the course of a few years usually follow them, that we are in a great degree indebted for the rapid extension and aggrandizement of our country.
Experience has proved that no portion of our population are more patriotic than the hardy and brave men of the frontier, or more ready to obey the call of their country and to defend her rights and her honor whenever and by whatever enemy assailed. They should be protected from the grasping speculator and secured, at the minimum price of the public lands, in the humble homes which they have improved by their labor. With this end in view, all vexatious or unnecessary restrictions imposed upon them by the existing preemption laws should be repealed or modified. It is the true policy of the Government to afford facilities to its citizens to become the owners of small portions of our vast public domain at low and moderate rates.
The present system of managing the mineral lands of the United States is believed to be radically defective. More than 1,000,000 acres of the public lands, supposed to contain lead and other minerals, have been reserved from sale, and numerous leases upon them have been granted to individuals upon a stipulated rent. The system of granting leases has proved to be not only unprofitable to the Government, but unsatisfactory to the citizens who have gone upon the lands, and must, if continued, lay the foundation of much future difficulty between the Government and the lessees. According to the official records, the amount of rents received by the Government for the years 1841, 1842, 1843, and 1844 was $6,354.74, while the expenses of the system during the same period, including salaries of superintendents, agents, clerks, and incidental expenses, were $26,111.11, the income being less than one-fourth of the expenses. To this pecuniary loss may be added the injury sustained by the public in consequence of the destruction of timber and the careless and wasteful manner of working the mines. The system has given rise to much litigation between the United States and individual citizens, producing irritation and excitement in the mineral region, and involving the Government in heavy additional expenditures. It is believed that similar losses and embarrassments will continue to occur while the present System of leasing these lands remains unchanged. These lands are now under the superintendence and care of the War Department, with the ordinary duties of which they have no proper or natural connection. I recommend the repeal of the present system, and that these lands be placed under the superintendence and management of the General Land Office, as other public lands, and be brought into market and sold upon such terms as Congress in their wisdom may prescribe, reserving to the Government an equitable percentage of the gross amount of mineral product, and that the preemption principle be extended to resident miners and settlers upon them at the minimum price which may be established by Congress.
I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War for information respecting the present situation of the Army and its operations during the past year, the state of our defenses, the condition of the public works, and our relations with the various Indian tribes within our limits or upon our borders. I invite your attention to the suggestions contained in that report in relation to these prominent objects of national interest. When orders were given during the past summer for concentrating a military force on the western frontier of Texas, our troops were widely dispersed and in small detachments, occupying posts remote from each other. The prompt and expeditious manner in which an army embracing more than half our peace establishment was drawn together on an emergency so sudden reflects great credit on the officers who were intrusted with the execution of these orders, as well as upon the discipline of the Army itself. To be in strength to protect and defend the people and territory of Texas in the event Mexico should commence hostilities or invade her territories with a large army, which she threatened, I authorized the general assigned to the command of the army of occupation to make requisitions for additional forces from several of the States nearest the Texan territory, and which could most expeditiously furnish them, if in his opinion a larger force than that under his command and the auxiliary aid which under like circumstances he was authorized to receive from Texas should be required. The contingency upon which the exercise of this authority depended has not occurred. The circumstances under which two companies of State artillery from the city of New Orleans were sent into Texas and mustered into the service of the United States are fully stated in the report of the Secretary of War. I recommend to Congress that provision be made for the payment of these troops, as well as a small number of Texan volunteers whom the commanding general thought it necessary to receive or muster into our service.
During the last summer the First Regiment of Dragoons made extensive excursions through the Indian country on our borders, a part of them advancing nearly to the possessions of the Hudsons Bay Company in the north, and a part as far as the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains and the head waters of the tributary streams of the Colorado of the West. The exhibition of this military force among the Indian tribes in those distant regions and the councils held with them by the commanders of the expeditions, it is believed, will have a salutary influence in restraining them from hostilities among themselves and maintaining friendly relations between them and the United States. An interesting account of one of these excursions accompanies the report of the Secretary of War. Under the directions of the War Department Brevet Captain Fremont, of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, has been employed since 1842 in exploring the country west of the Mississippi and beyond the Rocky Mountains. Two expeditions have already been brought to a close, and the reports of that scientific and enterprising officer have furnished much interesting and valuable information. He is now engaged in a third expedition, but it is not expected that this arduous service will be completed in season to enable me to communicate the result to Congress at the present session.
Our relations with the Indian tribes are of a favorable character. The policy of removing them to a country designed for their permanent residence west of the Mississippi, and without the limits of the organized States and Territories, is better appreciated by them than it was a few years ago, while education is now attended to and the habits of civilized life are gaining ground among them.
Serious difficulties of long standing continue to distract the several parties into which the Cherokees are unhappily divided. The efforts of the Government to adjust the difficulties between them have heretofore proved unsuccessful, and there remains no probability that this desirable object can be accomplished without the aid of further legislation by Congress. I will at an early period of your session present the subject for your consideration, accompanied with an exposition of the complaints and claims of the several parties into which the nation is divided, with a view to the adoption of such measures by Congress as may enable the Executive to do justice to them, respectively, and to put an end, if possible, to the dissensions which have long prevailed and still prevail among them.
I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for the present condition of that branch of the national defense and for grave suggestions having for their object the increase of its efficiency and a greater economy in its management. During the past year the officers and men have performed their duty in a satisfactory manner. The orders which have been given have been executed with promptness and fidelity. A larger force than has often formed one squadron under our flag was readily concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico, and apparently without unusual effort. It is especially to be observed that notwithstanding the union of so considerable a force, no act was committed that even the jealousy of an irritated power could construe as an act of aggression, and that the commander of the squadron and his officers, in strict conformity with their instructions, holding themselves ever ready for the most active duty, have achieved the still purer glory of contributing to the preservation of peace. It is believed that at all our foreign stations the honor of our flag has been maintained and that generally our ships of war have been distinguished for their good discipline and order. I am happy to add that the display of maritime force which was required by the events of the summer has been made wholly within the usual appropriations for the service of the year, so that no additional appropriations are required.
The commerce of the United States, and with it the navigating interests, have steadily and rapidly increased since the organization of our Government, until, it is believed, we are now second to but one power in the world, and at no distant day we shall probably be inferior to none. Exposed as they must be, it has been a wise policy to afford to these important interests protection with our ships of war distributed in the great highways of trade throughout the world. For more than thirty years appropriations have been made and annually expended for the gradual increase of our naval forces. In peace our Navy performs the important duty of protecting our commerce, and in the event of war will be, as it has been, a most efficient means of defense.
The successful use of steam navigation on the ocean has been followed by the introduction of war steamers in great and increasing numbers into the navies of the principal maritime powers of the world. A due regard to our own safety and to an efficient protection to our large and increasing commerce demands a corresponding increase on our part. No country has greater facilities for the construction of vessels of this description than ours, or can promise itself greater advantages from their employment. They are admirably adapted to the protection of our commerce, to the rapid transmission of intelligence, and to the coast defense. In pursuahce of the wise policy of a gradual increase of our Navy, large supplies of live-oak timber and other materials for shipbuilding have been collected and are now under shelter and in a state of good preservation, while iron steamers can be built with great facility in various parts of the Union. The use of iron as a material, especially in the construction of steamers which can enter with safety many of the harbors along our coast now inaccessible to vessels of greater draft, and the practicability of constructing them in the interior, strongly recommend that liberal appropriations should be made for this important object. Whatever may have been our policy in the earlier stages of the Government, when the nation was in its infancy, our shipping interests and commerce comparatively small, our resources limited, our population sparse and scarcely extending beyond the limits of the original thirteen States, that policy must be essentially different now that we have grown from three to more than twenty millions of people, that our commerce, carried in our own ships, is found in every sea, and that our territorial boundaries and settlements have been so greatly expanded. Neither our commerce nor our long line of coast on the ocean and on the Lakes can be successfully defended against foreign aggression by means of fortifications alone. These are essential at important commercial and military points, but our chief reliance for this object must be on a well-organized, efficient navy. The benefits resulting from such a navy are not confined to the Atlantic States. The productions of the interior which seek a market abroad are directly dependent on the safety and freedom of our commerce. The occupation of the Balize below New Orleans by a hostile force would embarrass, if not stagnate, the whole export trade of the Mississippi and affect the value of the agricultural products of the entire valley of that mighty river and its tributaries.
It has never been our policy to maintain large standing armies in time of peace. They are contrary to the genius of our free institutions, would impose heavy burdens on the people and be dangerous to public liberty. Our reliance for protection and defense on the land must be mainly on our citizen soldiers, who will be ever ready, as they ever have been ready in times past, to rush with alacrity, at the call of their country, to her defense. This description of force, however, can not defend our coast, harbors, and inland seas, nor protect our commerce on the ocean or the Lakes. These must be protected by our Navy.
Considering an increased naval force, and especially of steam vessels, corresponding with our growth and importance as a nation, and proportioned to the increased and increasing naval power of other nations, of vast importance as regards our safety, and the great and growing interests to be protected by it, I recommend the subject to the favorable consideration of Congress.
The report of the Postmaster-General herewith communicated contains a detailed statement of the operations of his Department during the pass year. It will be seen that the income from postages will fall short of the expenditures for the year between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000. This deficiency has been caused by the reduction of the rates of postage, which was made by the act of the 3d of March last. No principle has been more generally acquiesced in by the people than that this Department should sustain itself by limiting its expenditures to its income. Congress has never sought to make it a source of revenue for general purposes except for a short period during the last war with Great Britain, nor should it ever become a charge on the general Treasury. If Congress shall adhere to this principle, as I think they ought, it will be necessary either to curtail the present mail service so as to reduce the expenditures, or so to modify the act of the 3d of March last as to improve its revenues. The extension of the mail service and the additional facilities which will be demanded by the rapid extension and increase of population on our western frontier will not admit of such curtailment as will materially reduce the present expenditures. In the adjustment of the tariff of postages the interests of the people demand that the lowest rates be adopted which will produce the necessary revenue to meet the expenditures of the Department. I invite the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General on this subject, under the belief that such a modification of the late law may be made as will yield sufficient revenue without further calls on the Treasury, and with very little change in the present rates of postage. Proper measures have been taken in pursuance of the act of the 3d of March last for the establishment of lines of mail steamers between this and foreign countries. The importance of this service commends itself strongly to favorable consideration.
With the growth of our country the public business which devolves on the heads of the several Executive Departments has greatly increased. In some respects the distribution of duties among them seems to be incongruous, and many of these might be transferred from one to another with advantage to the public interests. A more auspicious time for the consideration of this subject by Congress, with a view to system in the organization of the several Departments and a more appropriate division of the public business, will not probably occur.
The most important duties of the State Department relate to our foreign affairs. By the great enlargement of the family of nations, the increase of our commerce, and the corresponding extension of our consular system the business of this Department has been greatly increased. In its present organization many duties of a domestic nature and consisting of details are devolved on the Secretary of State, which do not appropriately belong to the foreign department of the Government and may properly be transferred to some other Department. One of these grows out of the present state of the law concerning the Patent Office, which a few years since was a subordinate clerkship, but has become a distinct bureau of great importance. With an excellent internal organization, it is still connected with the State Department. In the transaction of its business questions of much importance to inventors and to the community frequently arise, which by existing laws are referred for decision to a board of which the Secretary of State is a member. These questions are legal, and the connection which now exists between the State Department and the Patent Office may with great propriety and advantage be transferred to the Attorney-General.
In his last annual message to Congress Mr. Madison invited attention to a proper provision for the Attorney-General as ""an important improvement in the executive establishment."" This recommendation was repeated by some of his successors. The official duties of the Attorney-General have been much increased within a few years, and his office has become one of great importance. His duties may be still further increased with advantage to the public interests. As an executive officer his residence and constant attention at the seat of Government are required. Legal questions involving important principles and large amounts of public money are constantly referred to him by the President and Executive Departments for his examination and decision. The public business under his official management before the judiciary has been so augmented by the extension of our territory and the acts of Congress authorizing suits against the United States for large bodies of valuable public lands as greatly to increase his labors and responsibilities. I therefore recommend that the Attorney-General be placed on the same footing with the heads of the other Executive Departments, with such subordinate officers provided by law for his Department as may be required to discharge the additional duties which have been or may be devolved upon him.
Congress possess the power of exclusive legislation over the District of Columbia, and I commend the interests of its inhabitants to your favorable consideration. The people of this District have no legislative body of their own, and must confide their local as well as their general interests to representatives in whose election they have no voice and over whose official conduct they have no control. Each member of the National Legislature should consider himself as their immediate representative, and should be the more ready to give attention to their interests and wants because he is not responsible to them. I recommend that a liberal and generous spirit may characterize your measures in relation to them. I shall be ever disposed to show a proper regard for their wishes and, within constitutional limits, shall at all times cheerfully cooperate with you for the advancement of their welfare.
I trust it may not be deemed inappropriate to the occasion for me to dwell for a moment on the memory of the most eminent citizen of our country who during the summer that is gone by has descended to the tomb. The enjoyment of contemplating, at the advanced age of near fourscore years, the happy condition of his country cheered the last hours of Andrew Jackson, who departed this life in the tranquil hope of a blessed immortality. His death was happy, as his life had been eminently useful. He had an unfaltering confidence in the virtue and capacity of the people and in the permanence of that free Government which he had largely contributed to establish and defend. His great deeds had secured to him the affections of his fellow-citizens, and it was his happiness to witness the growth and glory of his country, which he loved so well. He departed amidst the benedictions of millions of free-men. The nation paid its tribute to his memory at his tomb. Coming generations will learn from his example the love of country and the rights of man. In his language on a similar occasion to the present, ""I now commend you, fellow-citizens, to the guidance of Almighty God, with a full reliance on His merciful providence for the maintenance of our free institutions, and with an earnest supplication that whatever errors it may be my lot to commit in discharging the arduous duties which have devolved on me will find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom of your counsels.""
",First Annual Message,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
David Miliband,United Kingdom,2015-12-09,"The Prime Minister asked on Saturday that voters take a second look at Labour. He set out serious plans for the pursuit of noble causes based on clear values. This speech is about those values, and how a re-elected Labour government would make them real.
The core value we espouse is a commitment to use government to help give people the power to shape their own lives. The power that comes with income and wealth. The power that comes with skills and confidence. The power that comes with rights and democratic voice. Not just for the few but for all. It is a fundamentally progressive vision of the good society.
In this lecture I want to explore why and how only the centre-left, social democrats and radical liberals, can realise the progressive insight that a free and powerful people is made not born.
I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, when “progressive” was a word that neither Labour nor Conservative would have considered a compliment. Labour was struggling to reconcile the Labourism of its old right with the utopianism of the new left, the Tories sloughing off the pragmatism of Edward Heath for the radicalism of Margaret Thatcher. “Progressive” didn’t really capture what politics was about.
But after 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, progressive became the catchword for centre-left politics, for the less ideological more values-based ideas approach that united Clinton and Blair with the governments of Havel and Mandela. It is a compliment to our time in government that after 2005 our opponents tried to learn our language. David Cameron and George Osborne have both made speeches in which they tried to claim the idea of being a progressive force for the political right. But it is not a claim that withstands serious scrutiny.
In the 1990s , spurred by David Marquand’s book The Progressive Dilemma, Labour embraced a more pluralist centre-left politics, in a conscious effort to draw on its liberal as well as social democratic heritage. That coalition has now dominated politics for a decade, bringing together individual rights in a market economy with collective provision to promote social justice.
I am proud of the long lists of changes in each category. I think we have changed the country for the better. The liberal achievements – gay rights, human rights, employee rights, disability rights – on the one hand. The social democratic ones – childcare, university places, health provision – on the other. And then those areas that fused the best of both: a New Deal for the Unemployed that uses the private and voluntary sector, devolved budgets for disabled people, the digital switchover, Academies, all combine government leadership with bottom up innovation and engagement.
It is very striking the extent to which this agenda continues to dominate important parts of political life. After all, one reason the Conservative leadership are currently tied in policy knots – backing away from health reform, back to front on government’s role in sponsoring marriage, facing both ways on economic policy – is that they have felt it necessary to assert that they too seek progressive ends, contrary to the history of conservatism. It is quite a bizarre situation. New Labour was built on the application of our traditional values in new ways. The Tories are saying that they have got new values – in with social justice, out with no such thing as society – that will be applied in old ways, notably an assault on the legitimacy and purpose of government itself.
New Labour said the values never change but that the means need to be updated. The Tories want it the other way round. They say the values have changed, but, miraculously, the policies should stay the same. They even boast about not needing a ‘Clause IV moment’.
This is actually not just a dry technocratic debate. It is about how much hope we invest in the future. Progressives are optimists about change. Conservatives are fearful that change invariably means loss. We think things can work better. Conservatives worry that they never will. We trust, as Bill Clinton used to put it, that the future will be better than the past, and we all have a personal responsibility to make it so. The Conservatives think, as they always have, that Britain is broken.
Now the polls show the British people are not feeling particularly optimistic at the moment: the political system is in disrepute, our financial system has had to be rescued from deep collapse, the moral authority of the West is contested, and international institutions are all but paralysed on issues like climate change.
That explains why the Tories, after promising to ‘let sunshine win the day’ in 2006, have decided that not only that it is raining but that it will never stop. That is why they have embraced a rhetoric of national decline, and are now promising an Age of Austerity. They think they’ve spotted that people are miserable and if they can only make them more miserable still, they can benefit.
Personally, I think this pessimism is overdone. David Halpern’s work on the hidden wealth of nations provides some backing for this. And in any case, the purpose of politics is to change people’s minds not read them. As then Senator Obama said in his Jackson Day Dinner speech in October 2007, when his campaign started to catch fire, principles are more valuable than polling.
The truth is that the routines and assumptions of 20th century Britain are all under threat of change. So there is a sense of discontinuity and rupture, and no settled destination. Jobs, communities, families are changing. The changes in the space of one generation are stark; some times they are alarming.
But that does not mean to say that Britain is inevitably declining. The right way to see how Britain is changing is not through the prism of decline, but through the prism of transition. Transition in the economy, society, politics. Transition too in foreign policy. So we should judge parties on whether they understand the challenges of the modern world, and whether they have a vision for how to meet them.
The transitions through which we are living are profound:
– A multi-polar world, where the rise of the Asian middle class, at a rate of some 70m a year, is not just the growth market of tomorrow; it is an indicator of how economic power, and political power, is going to shift from West to East.
– A world that has to find a way to stop consuming resources as if there were three planets rather than one. It’s dropped off David Cameron’s top ten reasons to vote Conservative. It’s not dropped off ours.
– The twin challenges of better bringing up children and adjusting to ageing populations.
– Economies where manufacturing and services depend on intensive learning, knowledge creation, and scientific development.
– Societies that are more open and diverse than ever before, but where trust needs to be renewed.
– A world of political systems that develop new multilateral arrangements at the regional and global level, and embrace subsidiarity at the national and local level.
We know, in each area, where we have to get to. We know too that the old ways are not going to work. So we have to chart a new course. These are big questions and I cannot deal with all of them today. That is what our manifesto will do. But I do think there is a principle which applies to them all. I think it is a principle too that means the future requires philosophical and policy thinking that can only be supplied by the centre-left.
That principle is that power needs to be vested in the people, but we do not reveal a powerful populace simply in the act of withdrawing the state. In fact a powerless government simply means more power for the already powerful. That is the error that runs through David Cameron’s speeches. We make powerful people by providing a platform on which people can stand.
It is not just that Government must be a countervailing power to vested interests, which is what the Competition Act has done to protect consumers; or that Government must address inequalities, which is what tax credits and labour laws do; or that Government must forge alliances around the world, which is what the European Union does; or that Government must protect people from risks beyond their control, which is what our bailout of the banking system has done.
It is that the big challenges of the modern world require an alliance of active government and active citizens. And that although government may be more needed than before; it is more questioned than before; so as the Prime Minister said in launching the Smarter Government White Paper it needs to be more reformed than before, not more reduced than before.
The expansion of capacity in public services – not just staff but also capital investment – has achieved a qualitative shift in public service provision, both in its scope and its depth. Part of our job in the Labour Party is to persuade people that they don’t need another period of Tory government to remind them what its like to have underfunded services. But we know that in the next ten years investment cannot be the driver of reform in the way it has over the last ten. We simply will not manage chronic diseases that account for 80 per cent of the NHS budget without empowering the people who suffer those diseases; we will not restore trust in politics unless we bring the public into the decision making tent at local as well as national level; we will not reduce fear of crime or increa se creativity in education through the actions of police officers and teachers unless they build new kinds of relationships with people, parents, pupils.
The argument of the Right is that this alliance should be based on a zero sum view of relationships between government and society. To roll society forward you need to roll government back. That’s not how I see it. The transitions we face as a country require three interlocking commitments from government to nurture a country of powerful people.
First that it guarantees what markets and self help cannot provide. The reason the welfare state grew in the 19th and 20th centuries across Europe was simple: self help could not offer the services and protection that people needed. That remains true today – with new risks like care for the elderly added to old ones like the need for healthcare.
Today the Prime Minister is setting out how it is the responsibility of government to build an empowering education system for the future. It applies in other spheres too. If government does not guarantee apprenticeship places for young people, or a job guarantee if they have been unemployed for more than six months, no one will.
Guarantees do not always mean government funding; the social care debate, or university funding, shows that. They do not always mean government delivery: childcare shows that. But they do mean being clear about the birthrights of people, and committing to fulfil them: clear on the goals, pragmatic on the means.
It’s just bogus to say that when government takes on commitments it necessarily disempowers individuals. The right to a cancer diagnosis within a week, to see a specialist in two weeks, puts power in the hands of patients; to abolish the right is to empower the manager. The right to be treated for all conditions within 18 weeks is a powerful tool in the hands of individuals precisely because it is accompanied by the commitm ent that if they are not helped by the NHS within those periods they can go to an alternative provider.
Second, the role of government is to provide a platform for markets and civil society. Strong government can nurture citizen responsibility not stifle it. As James Purnell – soon no longer to be my colleague but a good friend who has a big contribution to make to public life outside Parliament in the future – said two weeks ago, the point about the modern centre-left is that we seek empowering government, dynamic markets and strong communities as supports for and disciplines on each other.
The role of government is not to eradicate markets but mobilise them. The fight against climate change is a good example. Carbon markets will not exist without a powerful role for government. And without carbon markets there will be no efficient reduction in carbon emissions. The plans for feed-in tariffs from April this year will enable citizens and communities to s ell renewable energy back to the grid at guaranteed prices. Alongside this there will be new incentives to install renewable heat and a financing scheme to make home energy insulation more affordable. This is not Government crowding out citizen initiative.
And governments are not an alternative to self help networks for the elderly and disabled to manage their own care. They are a key support to them. That is why the NHS is creating expert patient programmes and enrolling diabetes and Alzheimer’s patients in self-help networks. Strong government can be a platform for civil society when it becomes more porous, open and interactive in the use of its information, buildings, infrastructure and budgets. That is why the UK alongside the US is leading the world in opening up public data to the public.
Nor do we ignore the danger that Governments will tend to bureaucracy or obduracy without the check of strong communities, with strong rights of redress against poo r treatment, and ready-made levers to take power for themselves. That is why we have legislated for staff coops in the NHS. Whether employee or citizen led, the Labour Party has rediscovered its mutual tradition in the last decade not just the last month, and with the Cooperative Party and the Commission on Ownership we are not going to let it go.
We also know government has to promote rights to neighbourhood management in local services. It’s ironic that when I went to Hammersmith on Friday the Tory Council was resisting people power on its estates, as communities sought to use powers brought in by the Labour government to enable them to run, and save, their estate, in favour of bulldozing what the leader of the Council called “ghettos” to make way for more expensive housing.
Third, government only works as an ally of powerful people when power is situated in the right place – starting locally. We can only do that through what Phil Collins and Ric hard Reeves call turning Government upside down. We should start with the assumption that the individual should have power, but never forget that government needs to have enough power to stop the individual being overpowered. In government we would call it subsidiarity – so that fewer people would understand. In practice it means a more central role for local government, but also devolution to neighbourhoods.
Britain was built by powerful city government, but we have got the balance wrong between universality and dynamism in the last fifty years. That is one reason I favour in the next Parliament a referendum that is not just about the Alternative Vote for the House of Commons, but also about local government, fixed term Parliaments, and the House of Lords. Call it a Reset Referendum.
But localisation is not a strong enough recipe for powerful people in the modern world. Localisation without internationalism just means sink or swim. This applies in spades in our relations with the European Union:
– We will not make the transition to being a low carbon economy without European regulation.
– We will not make the transition to systemic financial regulation without effective European regulation.
– We will not make the transition to effective security for an age when terrorism not invasion is our risk, without effective European security cooperation.
Labour’s challenge is not its philosophy. It is that it has to answer for every time government does not fulfil this vision. But the Tories’ problem is that their instinct is the oldest deception in politics: that government just hurts the little guy. In essence it is an extension of Charles Murray’s dependency culture thesis about the welfare state from the 1980s, and applying to all functions of government not just welfare.
David Cameron’s Hugo Young Lecture last year was intended as a corrective to his disastrous foray into policy substa nce at his party conference where he said that the state was always the problem and never the solution. As he sought to allay fears that he had used the economic crisis to show his true colours as a small state Reaganite, he still showed what he really thinks.
The kernel of his analysis of Britain today was this: “There is less expectation to take responsibility, to work, to stand by the mother of your child, to achieve, to engage with your local community, to keep your neighbourhood clean, to respect other people and their property”. It was declinist. It blamed government for all ills. And every single assertion that can be measured in his list was wrong. Divorce rates are falling. School achievement is rising. Volunteering is up. Crime is down. The Tory dystopia of modern Britain relies on a picture of what is actually happening in Britain that has as much basis in reality as Avatar does. They need to believe that 54% of children born in poor areas are teena ge pregnancies for their politics to add up.
But though the instincts are clear they are split down the middle. Not right versus left. There isn’t a Tory left any more. But head versus heart. Radicalism versus reassurance. The heart says cut government, attack Europe. The head says: watch out, don’t say that, the voters might hear.
The Tories say big government is the problem, but promise a moratorium on change in the health service, the biggest employer in the world. They say Britain is heading the way of Greece, yet will not say how their deficit reduction plan differs from ours. They say we are a broken society…and will heal it through a social action line on Facebook. They say we have sold our birthright to Europe, but don’t want a bust up over it. Everyone knows we need to reform social care so people can grow old without fear, and all the Tories can do is put up scare posters.
I recognise the Tory difficulty. We faced it after 1994. You need to reassure people you are not a risk; and you need to offer change. But while we promised evolution not revolution in the short term, like sticking to Tory spending limits, we offered a platform for radical change in the medium to long term, from the minimum wage to school investment. Cameron’s got himself facing the other way round. The heart insisted on radical change in the short term – cuts in inheritance tax for the richest estates, a marriage tax allowance, immediate cuts in public spending, bring back fox hunting. But after that, the head gives the impression that it really doesn’t know what to do, other than press pause on reform, offer a £1 million internet prize for the best policy ideas, and then go off and play with the Wii. They have managed the unique feat of being so determined to advertise pragmatism that they have completely obliterated any medium term vision to their politics, while cleaving to short term commitments that leave the impression they are ideological zealots. It’s the precise opposite of the New Labour approach in the 1990s.
The result is that today’s Conservatism looks more and more like a toxic cocktail of Tory traditions. The government on offer from David Cameron would be as meritocratic as MacMillan, as compassionate as Thatcher, and as decisive as Major.
So yes Labour is behind in the polls. We are the underdog. But this is an exciting time to be on the centre-left of politics. The changes in our country require values of social justice, cooperation and internationalism if they are to benefit more people rather than fewer. We have learnt lessons in government. And the Tories can try rhetorical accommodation. It has been tried before. Salisbury talked about “Tory democracy” but bitterly opposed the extension of the vote and self government for Ireland. Macmillan talked about a Middle Way, but battened Britain down in a straitjacket of social conservatism.
What Labour offers is the courage to continue reforming so that Britain can prosper from the transitions shaking the modern world. So that Britain continues to believe in progress. Progressive reform is Labour’s mantle and we will not relinquish it.

",Message Regarding Civil Service Reform,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-04-06,"Thank you very much. I want to thank you, Vice President Pence, for your wonderful introduction but maybe more importantly for your incredible service to our country. You have done an incredible job. Thank you very much. These are real heroes.
Secretary Shulkin and Secretary Zinke, right in front of us, working so hard. I want to thank you for joining us as we pay tribute to America's warriors -- and I call them America's winners, because they are winners -- and mark this year's Soldiers Ride.
The Soldier Ride has been very, very unique. Lieutenant General Linnington, Deven Schei, and all of the dedicated people at the Wounded Warrior Project, thank you for organizing this event. Really great job. An amazing event. And thank you for serving those who have so bravely served our nation.
On behalf of the country, let me extend to all of the riders and your families the warmest possible welcome into, I call it, the People's House. This is the People's House. It's the White House, but it's the People's House. And I thank you all very much, especially all of the folks that are on stage with me. You are something very, very amazing and special. Thank you.
You've risked all that you have, all that you possess, to keep our people safe and our democracy secure. And we're going to keep it going, folks, for a long time, that I can tell you. In your honor, we're going to keep it going.
You've earned our freedom with your sweat and your blood and your incredible sacrifice. We salute you, we salute your service, and we salute the flag you have so courageously protected. We love our flag. Thank you.
The story of today's event is a story about America and the strength of her citizens. In 2004, a young man working in a tavern in the East End of Long Island -- I know that end of Long Island very well -- was moved by a desire to help his fellow Americans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. So Chris Carney had an idea. With the support of friends, Chris rode a bike across the country to raise funds and awareness for the Wounded Warrior Project. Great people. He biked 4,000 miles -- wow -- where's Chris? Where is Chris? Chris, stand up. 4,000 -- man. And raised, at the time, one million dollars.
This act of devotion to our heroes inspired others. And since that first year, the Soldier Ride -- it's why we're here today -- has become an annual event that unites and uplifts our nation. President Bush hosted the first Soldier Ride at the White House in 2008. And I am proud to continue this incredible tradition, and we're going to keep it going for a long time. I should have it for about seven more years.
Most of all, I'm proud to stand here today, before all of you, and to share with the nation the depth of our gratitude and the height of our total admiration for these folks, for our veterans, for anybody in uniform. And that includes our great men and women in blue. And I want to thank all of them, because they are just incredible people.
Each of you has forged in battle the sacred bonds of loyalty that link our people together. Our country, our values, our very way of life, endures because of you, and it endures because brave Americans raise up in every generation -- and they really do -- they rise to the occasion like nobody can rise to an occasion -- to fight for this country and to defend its citizens with every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears in their bodies.
Our way of life continues because of men and women who are willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect their fellow warriors, and to protect all of us. You have not only poured out the blood -- and all of your blood, in some cases -- for this country, but you have poured out the love from your souls and from your hearts. Each of you has carved your place into the history of this incredible nation and, I can tell you, into our hearts.
It is that love which brings us here today, which binds us together as one people, and which offers us the hope and promise of a future that is safe and secure and free. With one grateful heart, and one mighty spirit, the people of our nation thank you -- they really thank you -- and embrace you as you carry on this magnificent Soldier Ride. Good job. Good job.
May God bless you, may God bless our incredible country, may God bless our warriors, and let's have a great ride. Because I'll tell you what -- I couldn't do it. Thank you. Congratulations.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Speaks at a Wounded Warriors Event,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-wounded-warrior-april-6-2017
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-10-17,"Well it's only because I like your show.
I watch you.
They're fine, I just spoke to her. They came back, she got on another plane, I said, I hope this plane's better than the first one but yes, they had a problem.
Yes, they had a problem but she's fine.
Well I don't like it, I like getting the point across, I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not. That the economies not covered properly by these so called ""mainstream media"" and it isn't.
We went up almost 600 points yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news, you couldn't find it any where and the economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about.
And that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it. They do not treat us fairly and therefore if I do the news, they all want me on the news, so I can talk about it myself.
Probably not, no this is just for the mid terms. We want to win, we want to get the republicans nominated and we want to get them elected. We need republicans, you know they talk about majority, we have a majority of this much, I always say if somebody has a cold, just a minor cold, we no longer have a majority.
So, we need Republicans and we'll have tremendous border security when we do that, we'll continue with the tax cuts because we have other tax cuts planned, we're going to do a lot of cutting of the budget, also by the way, which I know is going to make you happy but we're going to do a lot of cutting.
We are, we're going to cut spending absolutely and we had to...
It's not as tough as you think and frankly there's a lot of fat in there but we had to get the military done last time. You know, President Obama let it go and I could say beyond President Obama, the military was in terrible shape. Now we've got $700 billion approved and we got $716 billion, two years, and our military is rebuilding like it's never been, really never happen before.
We got a raise for the people, they haven't had a raise in 11 years, we got a raise for the great people in the military and you know we're doing a lot of things, a lot of great things.
But now I'm going to also do some cutting of the budget because there's a lot fat, in order to get that $717, $716 billion we had to give up things to the democrats that I hated to give up, that you wouldn't have liked but I had to. But we had to rebuild the military.
Well I think we have a lot of things but you know, very big still we've cut regulations more than any president ever and you can go four years, eight years, it doesn't matter, this tremendous regulations that we can be cutting still and we're doing it.
You know, it used to take 21 years to get a highway built, you know, bad case, but it would take 21 years, we're trying to bring that down to two and maybe even one and by the way, if it's not right, we're not going to approve it but we're not going to take 21 years to find out whether or not we can do it.
It's part of that and it's going to start, infrastructure is going to be starting after the mid terms and we think that's going to be an easy one. But we're going to infrastructure, we're going to have everything, just more of the same. Look what's happened with our country and if you look at China they're down $20 trillion and we're up $11.7 trillion dollars in worth, that's a tremendous number.
I don't think so, I told them they want to make a deal and I said you guy's aren't ready yet, you're just not ready because look, they've been $500 billion a year our of country, it's time that we stopped, OK? We've rebuilt China, you know that better than anybody, you talk about it more than I do I think and it stopped and you see what's happening with China, it's a whole different ball game.
So, now they're paying 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion hasn't affected our economy, has it, cost's haven't gone up, inflation still low, very low, hasn't had an impact that we see except for one, billions of dollars are pouring into the treasury.
Well, I hope we're going to be on the better side of the equation, you know we need Saudi Arabia in terms of our fight against all of the terrorism, everything that's happening in Iran and other places but Iran's been the leader.
Iran has been set back very big when I knocked out the Iran deal, you know it's a different country than it was. When I first came in, if you look through it and you take a look, oh a day before I came in, Iran was taking over the Middle East, they were going to take over everything, from Syria to Yeman to this -- now they're way pulling back, they're having riots in the street, they are a mess as a country and that had to do with the day that I pulled that horrible $150 billion deal we gave them -- the Iran deal, the Iran nuclear deal. We pulled it.
They're going to come back and negotiate because they're really -- I'm not going to say they have no choice, but they're going to come back and negotiate. And if they don't, that's fine, too.
No, I don't want to do that.
I don't want to do that.
I do not want to do that, and frankly they have a tremendous order -- $110 billion. Every country in the world wanted a piece of that order. We got all of it. And what are we going to do? Again, I've had some senators come up and some congressmen that said, ""well, you know, sir, I think what we should do is we should not take that order.""
I said, ""who are we hurting? It's 500,000 jobs. It'll be ultimately $110 billion. It's the biggest order in the history of our country from an outside military."" And I said, ""we're going to turn that down? Why would we do that?""
So hopefully it's working out. We'll find out. We'll get down to the bottom of it. I hope that the King and the Crown Prince didn't know about it. That's the big factor in my eyes, and I hope they haven't.
Mike Pompeo just left. He went to Turkey as you know. He's coming back late tonight. I'm seeing him either tonight or tomorrow, and we'll find out.
No, and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that. That's a way of getting out the message. Look, we have fake news. Everyone's fake. You look at what's -- and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox.
Not all of them, but some of them, but there's so much misinformation being put out. That's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour. If I do a press conference every hour.
Now, we're communicating very well. The polls are going through the roof. I think the Republicans are going to do well in the midterms, and I'm doing a lot of work on this. But to be honest with you I get such phony news. Everything's a fake.
Even yesterday I gave an interview to AP and the headline was totally different from everything I said. The headline was just terrible. Headline -- everything else was perfect. You know, the quotes were all perfect and they've been criticized for it. You know, where did they come up with that headline?
So if I gave that up -- it's social media. I don't call it tweeting. I call it social media. It goes on your show. Every time I do something you say, ""we have breaking news. We have breaking news,"" whatever it may be, but I really believe if I didn't do that, Stuart, number one I probably wouldn't even be here talking to you.
I do like it. It's a form of getting out the truth.
Well, I enjoy them.
What's funny, sometimes I get a really nasty person with a horrible, stupid question from like CNN because they're just so horrible and so fake. But, you know, I get this horrible question from some reporter at CNN. Then I'll hit the reporter back just modestly hard, and the next thing, ""President hits reporters, terrible, freedom of the press.""
I say what do I -- they hit me so viciously, I give them a little jab and the story is Trump hits reporter. So, you know, it's pretty unfair stuff, but again you get out there whether I do it this way or whether I do it through social media, but we're definitely getting the word out. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country, and it's not being reported.
The -- you go to NBC -- which is terrible, terrible new organization -- but you go to NBC, CBS, ABC, I mean, CNN we don't even talk about, but you go to these things. Take a look. I think the other day is was 94 percent, and that's of good stories. In other words, they take a good story and make it bad to neutral.
Well, that's what they say --
But that's why I do what I do because I can sort of go over that.
I have no choice.
Do I have choice? May I ask you?
You enjoy what you do, too.
That's why you do it well.
Thank you, thank you. And enjoy the White House.
We love having you.
Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-10-11,"Thank you all very much. I very much appreciate it. We are here with a man who has become a friend of mine, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mrs. Trudeau. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
And we are discussing many things, including NAFTA. But we have discussions scheduled for quite a few subjects, and I think we both look very much forward. And I want to just tell you, Justin, great honor to have you both with us. Thank you. Thank you very much.
We'll see what happens. We have a tough negotiation, and it's something that you will know in the not-too-distant future. But we are going to be discussing NAFTA, and we'll be discussing defense because we have a great -- I mean, these are truly great and original allies, and their mutual defense is very important.
And I guess we'll also be discussing mutual offense, which people don't mention too often. But offense is part of defense.
So we have many things to talk about, but NAFTA will certainly be a big factor today. Okay?
No, I never discussed increasing it. I want it in perfect shape. That was just fake news by NBC, which gives a lot of fake news, lately. No, I never discuss -- I think somebody said I want ten times the nuclear weapons that we have right now. Right now, we have so many nuclear weapons. I want them in perfect condition, perfect shape. That's the only thing I've ever discussed.
General Mattis put out a statement, or is putting out a statement, saying that that was fake news -- that it was just mentioned that way. And it's, frankly, disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write. And people should look into it.
No, I want to have absolutely perfectly maintained -- which we are in the process of doing -- nuclear force. But when they said I want ten times what we have right now, it's totally unnecessary. Believe me. Because I know what we have right now.
We won't need an increase, but I want modernization and I want total rehabilitation. It's got to be in tip-top shape.
Well, I don't think anything changed. We're negotiating a NAFTA deal. It's time, after all of these years, and we'll see what happens. It's possible we won't be able to make a deal, and it's possible that we will. We have a great personal relationship, and we have a relationship now as two countries, I think, that's as close as ever.
But we'll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and, in all fairness, the Prime Minister wants to protect Canada and his people also. So we'll see what happens with NAFTA, but I've been opposed to NAFTA for a long time.
In terms of the fairness of NAFTA, I said we'll renegotiate. And I think Justin understands this: If we can't make a deal, it'll be terminated and that will be fine. They're going to do well; we're going to do well, but maybe that won't be necessary. But it has to be fair to both countries.
No, the press should speak more honestly. I mean, I've seen tremendously dishonest press. It's not even a question of distortion, like the question that was just asked before about ten times the nuclear capability. I know the capability that we have, believe me, and it is awesome. It is massive.
And so when they make up stories like that, that's just made up. And the generals will tell you that. And then they have their sources that don't exist. In my opinion, they don't exist. They make up the sources. There are no sources. Any other question?
We'll decide over the next fairly short period of time, but I think it's going to work out very well for both countries and Mexico.
You're going to see very soon. We're going to be announcing that very shortly.
What?
Oh, sure. Absolutely. It's possible we won't be able to reach a deal with one or the other. But in the meantime, we'll make a deal with one. But I think we have a chance to do something very creative that's good for Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
Very good. You mean last week? John, you're so far behind the times. Do you mean today or last week? Because today I didn't have lunch with him. No, I had a lunch last week, and we had a very good lunch. We have a very good relationship. The press really doesn't understand that, but that's okay. We actually have a very good relationship. What else?
I think I have a little bit different attitude on North Korea than other people might have.
And I listen to everybody, but ultimately my attitude is the one that matters, isn't it? That's the way it works. That's the way the system is. But I think I might have a somewhat different attitude and a different way than other people. I think perhaps I feel stronger and tougher on that subject than other people, but I listen to everybody.
And ultimately, I will do what's right for the United States and, really, what's right for the world. Because that's really a world problem; that's beyond just the United States. That's a world problem, and it's a problem that has to be solved. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.
I would. Yes. I would see that. Yes. Thank you, everybody.

Martin Van Buren,United States of America,1838-01-05 00:00:00,"Whereas information having been received of a dangerous excitement on the northern frontier of the United States in consequence of the civil war begun in Canada, and instructions having been given to the United States officers on that frontier and applications having been made to the governors of the adjoining States to prevent any unlawful interference on the part of our citizens in the contest unfortunately commenced in the British Provinces, additional information has just been received that, notwithstanding the proclamations of the governors of the States of New York and Vermont exhorting their citizens to refrain from any unlawful acts within the territory of the United States, and notwithstanding the presence of the civil officers of the United States, who by my directions have visited the scenes of commotion with a view of impressing the citizens with a proper sense of their duty, the excitement, instead of being appeased, is every day increasing in degree; that arms and munitions of war and other supplies have been procured by the insurgents in the United States; that a military force, consisting in part, at least, of citizens of the United States, had been actually organized, had congregated at Navy Island, and were still in arms under the command of a citizen of the United States, and that they were constantly receiving accessions and aid:
Now, therefore, to the end that the authority of the laws may be maintained and the faith of treaties observed, I, Martin Van Buren, do most earnestly exhort all citizens of the United States who have thus violated their duties to return peaceably to their respective homes; and I hereby warn them that any persons who shall compromit the neutrality of this Government by interfering in an unlawful manner with the affairs of the neighboring British Provinces will render themselves liable to arrest and punishment under the laws of the United States, which will be rigidly enforced; and, also, that they will receive no aid or countenance from their Government, into whatever difficulties they may be thrown by the violation of the laws of their country and the territory of a neighboring and friendly nation.

Rutherford B. Hayes,United States of America,1879-12-01 00:00:00,"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: The members of the Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first regular session under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation and grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of All Good for the large and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the Government, directly affecting the business interests of the country. I congratulate Congress on the successful execution of the resumption act. At the time fixed, and in the manner contemplated by law, United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the 1st of January last they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all business transactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed is about $40,000,000.The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last to November 15, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the Government bearing only 4 per cent interest have been sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all of the national debt which was redeemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which matures within less than two years is $792,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, and the balance is in bonds bearing 6 per cent interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent bonds, and, by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about $11,000,000 can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States further legislation is required, which it is hoped will be provided by Congress during its present session. The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States during the last fiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury and are now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the possession of the Government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further experimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation, it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. The retirement from circulation of United States notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal-tender paper money based wholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution and a violation of sound financial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided. The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national debt; and when, from necessity in time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off, on the return of peace, as rapidly as possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars annually to the Treasury. The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the United States for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy demands the attention of every department of the Government. This Territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the general interests of the nation, as well as the welfare of the citizens of the Territory, require its advance from the Territorial form of government to the responsibilities and privileges of a State. This important change will not, however, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah in very considerable number uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great unanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom. This objection is now removed. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative power of Congress and binding as a rule of action for all who reside within the Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it should be amended; and in aid of the purpose in view I recommend that more comprehensive and more searching methods for preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject. The elections of the past year, though occupied only with State officers, have not failed to elicit in the political discussions which attended them all over the country new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of the country toward a more general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in the sphere of national and State authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative interests of government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional and State attachments in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they maybe divided in opinions on other political subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the cooperation of the executive and legislative authorities of the States in this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the country or retard the general diffusion of prosperity. In a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the Government, and expressed the intention of transmitting to Congress as early as practicable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the Civil Service Commission. In view of the facts that during a considerable period the Government of Great Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses in various particulars analogous to those presented in this country, and that in recent years the measures adopted were understood to have been effective and in every respect highly satisfactory, I thought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elaborate and comprehensive report. The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage, and of official interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have, with great advantage, been established as conditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to the extent of the labor involved in its preparation and the omission of Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the expenses of the Commission, has been postponed until the present time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While the reform measures of another government are of no authority for us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and social life may commend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning the defects and abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of the people themselves to cooperate for their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office and of office tenure are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in the reports of Departments, in the debates and proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform has been admitted. To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free state. When the people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected and of the advisers who, in accordance with our political institutions, should be consulted in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect is indispensable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it before the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their official duties. Very different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their best public service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the same whatever party is in power and whatever policy prevails. As a consequence it follows that their tenure of office should not depend on the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully quite irrespective of partisan interests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure should also prevail in the appointment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. The authority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust, to be exercised in the public interest under all the sanctions which attend the obligation to apply the public funds only for public purposes. Every citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering the public service of his country. The only just ground of discrimination is the measure of character and capacity he has to make that service most useful to the people. Except in cases where, upon just and recognized principles--as upon the theory of pensions--offices and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past services, their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power is held. In the light of these principles it becomes of great importance to provide just and adequate means, especially for every Department and large administrative office, where personal discrimination on the part of its head is not practicable, for ascertaining those qualifications to which appointments and removals should have reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depends, but of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirants by handing over appointments and removals to mere influence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment and the interest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertaining personal fitness for office must be an important and permanent function of every just and wise government. It has long since become impossible in the great offices for those having the duty of nomination and appointment to personally examine into the individual qualifications of more than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with the enlargement of the civil service that proportion must continue to become less. In the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were so few in number that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates. Party managers and methods had not then become powerful agencies of coercion, hostile to the free and just exercise of the appointing power. A large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and efficiency rests upon the President, and it is my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority it is in the power of the Executive to do much to promote such a reform. But it can not be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without cooperation on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligent support among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally accepted theories of parties and demand changes in the methods of Departments are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in sound principles and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversaries. Every worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an honor to his country; but the people themselves, far more than their officers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical, and vigorous administration. By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated in the Revised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades in the great Departments was condemned, and examinations as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of examiners, were provided for and made conditions of admission to the public service. These statutes are a decision by Congress that examinations of some sort as to attainments and capacity are essential to the well-being of the public service. The important questions since the enactment of these laws have been as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence or common right and merit were to control the access to the examinations. In practice these examinations have not always been open to worthy persons generally who might wish to be examined. Official favoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards, subjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence the standard of admission fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was also almost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of capacity, highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and more radical change was obviously required. In the annual message of December, 1870, my predecessor declared that--There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of Departments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men, for public place. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States. Congress accordingly passed the act approved March 3, 1871, ""to regulate the civil service of the United States and promote the efficiency thereof,"" giving the necessary authority to the Executive to inaugurate a civil-service reform. Acting under this statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure a system of just and effectual examinations under uniform supervision, a number of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose, who entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared with an intelligent appreciation of the requirements of the service the regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who in their capacity as a board have been known as the ""Civil Service Commission."" Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for the compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the Commission. It appears from the report of the Commission submitted to the President in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an appropriation of about $25,000 would be required to meet the annual expenses, including salaries, involved in discharging the duties of the Commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon the labors of the Commission: If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the rules can, after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the public service and relieve the Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of Departments from influences prejudicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the members of the Cabinet and their subordinates in the Departments, and in that opinion I concur. And in the annual message of December of the same year similar views are expressed and an appropriation for continuing the work of the Commission again advised. The appropriation was not made, and as a consequence the active work of the Commission was suspended, leaving the Commission itself still in existence. Without the means, therefore, of causing qualifications to be tested in any systematic manner or of securing for the public service the advantages of competition upon any extensive plan, I recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the work of the Commission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under many embarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres in the Executive Departments in Washington and in a number of the custom-houses and post-offices of the principal cities of the country, with a view to further test their effects, and in every instance they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under the Administration of my predecessor. I think the economy, purity, and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction, wherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the Government, together with ample provision for their general supervision in order to secure consistency and uniform justice. Reports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the Postmaster-General, from the postmaster in the city of New York, where such examinations have been some time on trial, and also from the collector of the port, the naval officer, and the surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has in various ways contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rules can not fail to be of decided benefit to the service. The reports of the Government officers, in the city of New York especially, bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respective offices, showing that--These examinations and the excellent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service, and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been on the part of these latter an increased interest in the work and a desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raised. The examinations have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests and the method of determining the results, and those visitors have without exception approved the methods employed, and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion. Upon such considerations I deem it my duty to renew the recommendation contained in my annual message of December, 1877, requesting Congress to make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the work of the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate compensation to persons in the public service who may perform extra labor upon or under the Commission, as the Executive may direct. I am convinced that if a just and adequate test of merit is enforced for admission to the public service and in making promotions such abuses as removals without good cause and partisan and official interference with the proper exercise of the appointing power will in large measure disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointments and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which not only interferes with the due discharge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in the views of several of my predecessors in the Presidential office, and directly within the law of 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by regulation made on the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be necessary, to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal officers. But while their right to hold and freely express their opinions can not be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their official duties nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinions. Reasons of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which forbid the use of official power for the oppression of the private citizen impose upon the Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies for party purposes upon the salaries of officers is highly demoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money in aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officer, it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful in its service. Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful. With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of the local laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provincial authorities deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to American fishermen. The United States minister in London has been instructed to present a demand for $105,305.02 in view of the damages received by American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of January, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the British Government, and an early reply is anticipated. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examinations the subject of our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British Government, with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of Washington. Efforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to the exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the Lakes, which has resulted in important modifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion government on the subject in the interest of humanity and commerce. In accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of Congress, commissioners were appointed to represent the United States at the two international exhibitions in Australia, one of which is now in progress at Sydney, and the other to be held next year at Melbourne. A desire has been expressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested in the important and growing trade with Australia that an increased provision should be made by Congress for the representation of our industries at the Melbourne exhibition of next year, and the subject is respectfully submitted to your favorable consideration. The assent of the Government has been given to the landing on the coast of Massachusetts of a new and independent transatlantic cable between France, by way of the French island of St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on the subject. The conditions imposed before allowing this connection with our shores to be established are such as to secure its competition with any existing or future lines of marine cable and preclude amalgamation therewith, to provide for entire equality of rights to our Government and people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the disadvantage of any future cable communication between France and the United States which may be projected and accomplished by our citizens. An important reduction of the present rates of cable communication with Europe, felt to be too burdensome to the interests of our commerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment of this competing line. The attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety of some general regulation by Congress of the whole subject of transmarine cables by my predecessor in his message of December 7, 1875, and I respectfully submit to your consideration the importance of Congressional action in the matter. The questions of grave importance with Spain growing out of the incidents of the Cuban insurrection have been for the most part happily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the commission now sitting in Washington for the decision of private cases in this connection will soon be able to bring its labors to a conclusion. The long-standing question of East Florida claims has lately been renewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Congressional action for its final disposition. A treaty with the Netherlands with respect to consular rights and privileges similar to those with other powers has been signed and ratified, and the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st of July last. Negotiations for extradition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark are now in progress. Some questions with Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict emigrants have arisen, but it is not doubted that they will be arranged upon a just and satisfactory basis. A question has also occurred with respect to an asserted claim by Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutelage over persons and property of Swiss citizens naturalized in this country. It is possible this may require adjustment by treaty. With the German Empire frequent questions arise in connection with the Subjects of naturalization and expatriation, but the Imperial Government has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them. In consequence of the omission of Congress to provide for a diplomatic representative at Athens, the legation to Greece has been withdrawn. There is now no channel of diplomatic communication between the two countries, and the expediency of providing for one in some form is submitted to Congress. Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium continue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial importance. A change of the personal head of the Government of Egypt has taken place. No change, however, has occurred in the relations between Egypt and the United States. The action of the Egyptian Government in presenting to the city of New York one of the ancient obelisks, which possess such historic interest, is highly appreciated as a generous mark of international regard. If prosperity should attend the enterprise of its transportation across the Atlantic, its erection in a conspicuous position in the chief commercial city of the nation will soon be accomplished. The treaty recently made between Japan and the United States in regard to the revision of former commercial treaties it is now believed will be followed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. The attention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnity funds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with their accumulated interest, now amount to considerable sums. If any part of these funds is justly due to American citizens, they should receive it promptly; and whatever may have been received by this Government in excess of strictly just demands should in some form be returned to the nations to whom it equitably belongs. The Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the question of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with a dispassionate fairness and to cooperate in such measures as may tend to prevent injurious consequences to the United States. The negotiations are still proceeding, and will be pressed with diligence. A question having arisen between China and Japan about the Lew Chew Islands, the United States Government has taken measures to inform those powers of its readiness to extend its good offices for the maintenance of peace if they shall mutually deem it desirable and find it practicable to avail themselves of the proffer. It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two nations on each side of the Rio Grande, under the instructions of their respective Governments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and in the localities where formerly most destructive have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a confident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present orders to our military commanders as to crossing the border, without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. The third installment of the award against Mexico under the claims commission of July 4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in course of distribution in pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the same. This satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increased contribution of capital and industry by our people to the development of the great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom of Congress the provision of suitable legislation looking to this result. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again fully restored by the arrival of a minister from that country to the United States. This is especially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an inter-oceanic canal has recently assumed a new and important aspect and is now under discussion with the Central American countries through whose territory the canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightened statesmanship on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a work will largely inure to the benefit, not only of their own citizens and those of the United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted that should the work be undertaken under the protective auspices of the United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of way and its security by the Central American Governments, the capital for its completion would be readily furnished from this country and Europe, which might, failing such guaranties, prove inaccessible. Diplomatic relations with Chile have also been strengthened by the reception of a minister from that country. The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chile still continues. The United States have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter further than to convey to all the Governments concerned the assurance that the friendly offices of the Government of the United States for the restoration of peace upon an honorable basis will be extended in case the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cordial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, and trade with those countries is improving. A provision for regular and more frequent mail communication, in our own ships, between the ports of this country and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve the attention of Congress as an essential precursor of an enlargement of our commerce with them and an extension of our carrying trade. A recent revolution in Venezuela has been followed by the establishment of a provisional government. This government has not yet been formally recognized, and it is deemed desirable to await the proposed action of the people which is expected to give it the sanction of constitutional forms. A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan Islands to make surveys and take possession of the privileges ceded to the United States by Samoa in the harbor of Pago-Pago. A coaling station is to be established there, which will be convenient and useful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic relations with Roumania and Servia, now become independent sovereignties, is at present under consideration, and is the subject of diplomatic correspondence. There is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and American countries, and it is believed that with judicious action in regard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced and that American products and manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers upon this subject, under the system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining much valuable information, which has been and will continue to be laid before Congress and the public from time to time. The third article of the treaty with Russia of March 30, 1867, by which Alaska was ceded to the United States, provides that the inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may from time to time adopt in regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country. Both the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people require that some organized form of government over the Territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with common-law offenses, such as assault, robbery, and murder, and no magistrate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this character, not only among the original inhabitants, but among citizens of the United States and other countries who have engaged in mining, fishing, and other business operations within the territory. A bill authorizing the appointment of justices of the peace and constables and the arrest and detention of persons charged with criminal offenses, and providing for an appeal to United States courts for the district of Oregon in suitable cases, will at a proper time be submitted to Congress. The attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $273,827,184.46; the ordinary expenditures for the same period were $266,947,883.53, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $6,879,300.93.The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter, commencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters of the year, $208,156,336.39; total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures, $91,683,385.10; and for the remaining three quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at $172,316,614.90, making the total expenditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the year ending June 30, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1881, estimated according to existing laws, will be $288,000,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be $278,097,364.39, leaving a surplus of $9,902,635.61 for that year. The large amount expended for arrears of pensions during the last and the present fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249.60, has prevented the application of the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for the current year; but these arrears having been substantially paid, it is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained without any change of existing law. The Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same being for a less sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress from that Department during a period of at least twelve years. He concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such legislation as will authorize the enlistment of the full number of 25,000 men for the line of the Army, exclusive of the 3,463 men required for detached duty, and therefore not available for service in the field. He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for the disposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and reservations, which, though very valuable in themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civilization and settlement. He unites with the Quartermaster-General in recommending that an appropriation be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly fireproof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims, and other valuable records now in the Quartermaster-General's Office, and exposed to great risk of total destruction by fire. He also recommends, in conformity with the views of the Judge-Advocate-General, some declaratory legislation in reference to the military statute of limitations as applied to the crime of desertion. In these several recommendations I concur. The Secretary of War further reports that the work for the improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under contract with Mr. James B. Eads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of success in the attainment of results than during any previous year. The channel through the South Pass, which at the beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only 7 1/2 feet of water, had on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of 26 feet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of 30 feet. Payments have been made in accordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,250,000; and further payments will become due, as provided by the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the channel now secured. The reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates present a full and detailed account of the military operations for the suppression of hostilities among the Indians of the Ute and Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the officers and troops engaged for promptness, skill, and courage displayed. The past year has been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of this Government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will prove permanently successful. This Department was enabled during the past year to find temporary, though crowded, accommodations and a safe depository for a portion of its records in the completed east wing of the building designed for the State, War, and Navy Departments. The construction of the north wing of the building, a part of the structure intended for the use of the War Department, is being carried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal appropriations as will secure its speedy completion. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been completed and made ready for sea. The total expenditures of the year ended June 30, 1879, including specific appropriations not estimated for by the Department, were $13,555,710.09. The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amount of these specific appropriations, were $13,343,317.79; but this is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was, therefore, a balance of $1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended and to the credit of the Department on June 30, 1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $14,864,147.95, which exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $361,897.28. The reason for this increase is explained in the Secretary's report. The appropriations available for the present fiscal year are $14,502,250.67, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary, answer all the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879 was $5,770,404.12, of which $1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,674,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of the year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, there will remain unexpended at the end of the year $477,359.30 of the current appropriations. The report of the Secretary shows the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the Pay Corps of the Navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with him in recommending the removal of the observatory to a more healthful location. That institution reflects credit upon the nation, and has obtained the approbation of scientific men in all parts of the world. Its removal from its present location would not only be conducive to the health of its officers and professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness. The appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been made for the Department of Justice in gross, was subdivided at the last session of Congress, and no appropriation whatever was made for the payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the service of process or for the discharge of other duties; and since June 30 these officers have continued the performance of their duties without compensation from the Government, taking upon themselves the necessary incidental outlays, as well as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution of the process of the United States failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriation. This course of official conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the Attorney-General, who informed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon the prospect of future legislation by Congress. I therefore especially recommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose. The act making the principal appropriation for the Department of Justice at previous sessions has uniformly contained the following clause: And for defraying the expenses which my be incurred in the enforcement of the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled ""An act to amend an act approved May 31, 1870, entitled 'An act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of this Union, and for other purposes,'"" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto. No appropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no general election for Members of Congress occurred, the omission was a matter of little practical importance. Such election will, however, take place during the ensuing year, and the appropriation made for the pay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such elections. The business of the Supreme Court is at present largely in arrears. It can not be expected that more causes can be decided than are now disposed of in its annual session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits also the business has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the discussion of questions of a public character. The remedy suggested by the Attorney-General is the appointment of additional circuit judges and the creation of an intermediate court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, of not more than $60,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparison with the objects to be attained. The report of the Postmaster-General bears testimony to the general revival of business throughout the country. The receipts of the Post-Office Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $30,041,982.86, being $764,465.91 more than the revenues of the preceding year. The amount realized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards was $764,465.91 more than in the preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The expenditures of the Department were $33,449,899.45, of which the sum of $376,461.63 was paid on liabilities incurred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year were $801,209.77 less than in the preceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the operation of the law passed June 17, 1878, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commission on the value of stamps sold to a commission on stamps canceled. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues of the Department, was $3,031,454.96, being $2,276,197.86 less than in the preceding year. The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are estimated at $39,920,900 and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for out of the Treasury of $7,710,900.The relations of the Department with railroad companies have been harmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their compensation by the appropriation for special facilities, and the railway post-office lines have been greatly extended, especially in the Southern States. The interests of the Railway Mail Service and of the public would be greatly promoted and the expenditures could be more readily controlled by the classification of the employees of the Railway Mail Service as recommended by the Postmaster-General, the appropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be made in gross. The Postmaster-General recommends an amendment of the law regulating the increase of compensation for increased service and increased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for such increased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enactment of a general law authorizing contracts with American-built steamers, carrying the American flag, for transporting the mail between ports of the United States and ports of the West Indies and South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulated by annual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid for the domestic star service. The arrangement made by the Postmaster-General and the Secretary of the Treasury for the collection of duty upon books received in the mail from foreign countries has proved so satisfactory in its practical operation that the recommendation is now made that Congress shall extend the provisions of the act of March 3, 1879, under which this arrangement was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received in the mails from foreign countries. The reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, setting forth the present state of our relations with the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory that the occurrence of two disturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of property, is all the more to be lamented. The history of the outbreak on the White River Ute Reservation, in western Colorado, has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the public press that its remarkable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indians and the border settlements in western Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria, at the head of a small band of marauders, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way across the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil. While these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of Indians were engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian population have fully justified the expectations of those who believe that by humane and peaceful influences the Indian can be led to abandon the habits of savage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupations. What they have already accomplished in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable success which has attended the experiment of employing as freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed by them for the education of their children may be taken as sufficient proof that they will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they continue to be wisely and fairly guided. The ""Indian policy"" sketched in the report of the Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is to make liberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle the Indians upon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their farms, inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus provided for to dispose by sale of the lands on their reservations not occupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the Government of the expenses now provided for by annual appropriations, must commend itself as just and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove those obstructions which the existence of large reservations presents to the settlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the Government to give Indians a title in fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment. I also repeat the recommendation made in my first annual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their families for a number of years, and who are willing to detach themselves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them patents containing the same provision of inalienability for a certain period. The experiment of sending a number of Indian children of both sexes to the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive an elementary English education and practical instruction in farming and other useful industries, has led to results so promising that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the Interior Department for the establishment of an Indian school on a larger scale. This school has now 158 pupils, selected from various tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of a number of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the Pacific Slope in a similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to the liberality of Congress and to the philanthropic munificence of the American people. Last spring information was received of the organization of an extensive movement in the Western States, the object of which was the occupation by unauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian Territory ceded by the Cherokees to the Government for the purpose of settlement by other Indian tribes. On the 26th of April I issued a proclamation warning all persons against participation in such an attempt, and by the cooperation of a military force the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent of the executive power; but it would be unwise to ignore the fact that a territory so large and so 'fertile, with a population so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened this year when the surrounding States are more densely settled and the westward movement of our population looks still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances the difficulty of maintaining the Indian Territory in its present state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare for such a contingency. I therefore fully approve of the advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occasion, to divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate; to acquire individual title in fee instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the Government for their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would more certainly secure for themselves the value of their possessions, and at the same time promote their progress in civilization and prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present state of things in the Territory. The question whether a change in the control of the Indian service should be made was in the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint committee of both Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the decision of that question, then in prospect, would ""arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indians themselves."" Since then, the committee having reported, the question has been decided in the negative by a vote in the House of Representatives. For the reasons here stated, and in view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much-needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and to unsettle salutary measures now in progress for the government and improvement of the Indians, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to stand. The efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the depredations on the timber lands of the United States have been continued, and have met with considerable success. A large number of cases of trespass have been prosecuted in the courts of the United States; others have been settled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for the value of the timber taken by them. The proceeds of these prosecutions and settlements turned into the Treasury far exceed in amount the sums appropriated by Congress for this purpose. A more important result, however, consists in the fact that the destruction of our public forests by depredation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in extent, and it is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued and sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress such trespasses, at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in the Territories, where timber for the daily requirements of the population can not, under the present state of the law, be otherwise obtained. I therefore earnestly invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a law be enacted enabling the Government to sell timber from the public lands without conveying the fee, where such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to conform to domestic wants and business requirements, while at the same time guarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. The enactment of such a law appears to become a more pressing necessity every day. My recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture is the leading interest and the permanent industry of our people. It is to the abundance of agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely increased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look for its continued maintenance to the same substantial resource. There is no branch of industry in which labor, directed by scientific knowledge, yields such increased production in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which the encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately extended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy, but, on the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums annually that might be saved through well-directed efforts by the Government to promote this vital interest. The results already accomplished with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command of the Department of Agriculture is an earnest of what may be expected with increased appropriations for the several purposes indicated in the report of the Commissioner, with a view to placing the Department upon a footing which will enable it to prosecute more effectively the objects for which it is established. Appropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the establishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry, and for an increase of force. The requirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report of the Commissioner under the head of the immediate necessities of the Department, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country can not with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture. It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Education the extent to which educational privileges throughout the United States have been advanced during the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests upon Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to education, supplemental to local action in the States and Territories and in the District of Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders of our Government has not only furnished the basis for the support of the common-school systems of the newer States, but laid the foundations for the maintenance of their universities and colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this traditional policy, for the further benefit of all these interests and the extension of the same advantages to every portion of the country, it is hoped will receive your favorable consideration. To preserve and perpetuate the national literature should be among the foremost cares of the National Legislature. The library gathered at the Capitol still remains unprovided with any suitable accommodations for its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of the collection, increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of copyright, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific library of the Smithsonian Institution, call for building accommodations which shall be at once adequate and fireproof. The location of such a public building, which should provide for the pressing necessities of the present and for the vast increase of the nation's books in the future, is a matter which addresses itself to the discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommended as a measure which should unite all suffrages and which should no longer be delayed. The joint commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1876, for the purpose of supervising and directing the completion of the Washington National Monument, of which commission the President is a member, has given careful attention to this subject, and already the strengthening of the foundation has so far progressed as to insure the entire success of this part of the work. A massive layer of masonry has been introduced below the original foundation, widening the base, increasing the stability of the structure, and rendering it possible to carry the shaft to completion. It is earnestly recommended that such further appropriations be made for the continued prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of this national monument at an early day. In former messages, impressed with the importance of the subject, I have taken occasion to commend to Congress the adoption of a generous policy toward the District of Columbia. The report of the Commissioners of the District, herewith transmitted, contains suggestions and recommendations, to all of which I earnestly invite your careful attention. I ask your early and favorable consideration of the views which they express as to the urgent need of legislation for the reclamation of the marshes of the Potomac and its Eastern Branch within the limits of the city, and for the repair of the streets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks and now by decay rendered almost impassable and a source of imminent danger to the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the Commissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of these important works, and should be supplemented by timely appropriations from the Federal Treasury. The filling of the flats in front of the city will add to the adjacent lands and parks now owned by the United States a large and valuable domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, and will also, as an incidental result, secure the permanent improvement of the river for the purposes of navigation. The Constitution having invested Congress with supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, its citizens must of necessity look to Congress alone for all needful legislation affecting their interests; and as the territory of this District is the common property of the people of the United States, who equally with its resident citizens are interested in the prosperity of their capital, I can not doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voice of the country in any measures you may adopt for this purpose. I also invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of the public schools of this District, as exhibited in the report of the Commissioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly increasing, no adequate provision exists for a corresponding increase of school accommodation, and the Commissioners are without the means to meet this urgent need. A number of the buildings now used for school purposes are rented, and are in important particulars unsuited for the purpose. The cause of popular education in the District of Columbia is surely entitled to the same consideration at the hands of the National Government as in the several States and Territories, to which munificent grants of the public lands have been made for the endowment of schools and universities.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-01-22,"Morning.
That's right.
I have, and --
No. Not at all. And -- we're -- we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's—going to be just fine.
I do. I do. I have a great relationship with President Xi. We just signed probably the biggest deal ever made. It certainly has the potential to be the biggest deal ever made. And -- it was a very interesting period of time time.
But we got it done, and -- no, I do. I think -- the relationship is very, very good.
I did. I did. I watched some of it last night
I got -- I had a busy day yesterday, as you know. You were there. And we had the speech and we had lots of meetings with different leaders, including Pakistan and others. Other countries. In addition to businessmen all over the place. But I did get to see some of it. It's a hoax. It's a total hoax. It's a perfect conversation
I think the team was really good. And -- the facts are all on our side. The Republican party has never been this unified. You saw that. 195 to nothing. I guess twice. In fact we got three Democrats voting for us. That was with the House. I think --
-- I really don't know. I think that -- if everybody tells the truth, it's perfect. All you have to do is read the transcript. Read -- if you take a look at the transcript -- and it's really two transcripts. It's -- you know, I had a first call which was perfect, and I had a second call which was perfect.
You notice they don't mention the calls, though. They never mention the calls. They talk about everything but the calls. All they have to do is read the transcripts. I put it out all the time. The other thing is speak to the president of Ukraine. He's been great, I have to tell you. And his foreign minister's been great.
They constantly -- say there was no pressure. They don't even know what we're doing. They think it's crazy. So they got the money. In fact they got it very early. President Obama gave them nothing. He gave them pillows and sheets and things like that, and I gave them tank busters. You know, it's a disgraceful hoax.
But we do it.
But no, you asked me- the question.
And I have to answer it—you are my friend -- for too long.
Right.
Well, I appreciate that very much. We do. We have an incredible economy. The consumer has never been so rich. They -- you know, they're -- between the tax cuts and the regulation cuts -- people forget about regulation. I think it might have been more important than the tax cuts. But we have -- a consumer in the United States that has never done so well.
And I think we're really poised to have I think we have tremendous potential. You know, we're at a point where we've done so well, I think we're going do much better. We have tremendous potential.
Right, right thank you --
Thank you.
Well, I think it's the opposite, actually. The Fed raised too fast interest. They brought up the rate too fast, and they didn't drop it fast enough. And that was very -- you know, that was a lot of increases, and it was a lot of increase. And I think it's really the opposite of what you're saying. Now they've dropped it, but it was very late.
And you look at other countries where they actually have negative interest rates, negative in a positive way. I mean they're actually getting paid -- they make a loan and they end up --
-- getting paid.
Well, they don't know yet. It's so new. I want to know who are the people that buy. Okay? Who are the people that buy and they invest in Germany and end up getting, you know, less money at the period of time -so I -- have to find these people. But -- no, if Germany -- and -- we're the most prime in the world.
We're the leader in the world. We have the dollar, and the dollar's very strong. A lotta -- a lotta things are happening. But, you know, we're paying higher interest than other countries because of the Fed. If we were paying less, I would do it, and I'd pay off a lot of debt.
I'd do a lot of things.
Well, I don't want talk doghouse. I wish he didn't raise the rates. That was not what I thought would happen
I think the rate should go down.
No, because I think the dollar's very, very strong. And I think the rate should go down. We have a very strong dollar, and that sounds good, and it is good in many ways, but it's very bad in terms of manufacturing. I've created almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. The past administration said manufacturing is dead, which I said, ""Tell me about that.
How do you -- you can't do that."" And we have had a tremendous success, but it's harder with a strong dollar. And -- I want this dollar to be strong. I want it to be so powerful. I want it to be great. But if you lower the interest rates, so many good things would happen.
And one of the things I do want to do is pay off debt, and we're poised for tremendous growth. It'll really kick in toward the end of this year. But --
we're poised for tremendous growth.
We had many things.
Well, it'll be higher than 2%. A lotta people are very thrilled with that. Me, I'm not, but we had a lot of bad things happen. Number one, the Fed was not good.
As far as I'm concerned. And that was a big blip that should not have taken place. It should not have happened. But it's one of those things. But we had Boeing. We had the big strike with General Motors. We had things happen that are very unusual to happen.
Including some unbelievably powerful storms. You know, we were hit with storms. Now, with all of that, had we not done the big raise on interest, I think we would have been close to 4%, and I -- could see 5,000 to 10,000 points more on the Dow. But that was a killer when they raised the rate. It was just a big mistake.
And they admit to it. They admit to it. I was right. I don't wanna be right, but I was right.
Okay, I think the biggest thing about getting the deal with China -- number one, it's a great deal for us. It's an important deal for China, because they were -- you know, their supply chains were breaking. It was -- you know, it's been tough for them. The best thing that happened is we have two countries that like each other again, because it was getting pretty nasty.
And, you know, they have taken advantage of our country for 30 years and we -- I was not going let it happen. And -- we've taken in billions and billions of dollars. The tariffs are still on, so I still have that negotiating chip. I have 25% tariffs on, and that's a great negotiating chip. And yes, we're starting phase two very soon.
But the relationship that we have now with China is probably better than it's ever been. The relationship I have with President Xi, president for life. Okay? It's not bad. But the relationship I have with President Xi is, you know, I think extraordinary, considering he's for China, I'm for us.
But -- the deal is a phenomenal deal. We will take in $250 billion -- they're going to be buying $250 billion, and it could go a lot higher than that.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Absolutely.
You -- I know I was watching you and you were really surprised that so many of these other things, the intellectual property, so many of these other things were --
-- were part of the deal.
Farms
Yeah.
And this is -- manufacturing. This is -- technology. This -- phase one is a massive deal. And in the end, it's probably $250 billion, but it could go much higher than that. And just that alone, not even talking about the USMCA, which now we just got passed. In fact, when I go back I'll be signing it. It's all passed.
And we had I believe 89 votes in the Senate, which is tremendous.
Yeah. Boris and I are friends and he wants to make a deal, and that's okay with me.
I think they want it, they need it.
Oh yeah. We're starting. We've already started negotiating. And frankly, we're starting with Europe too. Europe is -- to be honest with you, Europe has been very, very tough to deal with. They've taken advantage of our country, the European Union, for many, many years. And I told them, we can't do it anymore.
I met with them yesterday. I wanted to wait till I finished China, to be honest with you. I'm -- always like to be very transparent. I wanted to wait till I finished China. I didn't want to go with China and Europe at the same time. Now China's done, and I met with the new head of the European Commission, who's terrific.
And had a great talk. But I said, look, if we don't get something, I'm going to have to take action, and the action will be a very high tariffs on their cars and other things that come into our country. Now, saying that, I don't want your audience to get nervous. They're going to make a deal, because they have to. They have to. They have no choice.
But we've had a tremendous deficit for many, many years. Over $150 billion with Europe. And they are -- frankly, Jean-Claude was a friend of mine, but he was impossible to deal with. And I think it's going to be a lot better for Boris now too. You couldn't make a deal. It was very hard to make a deal. Now, I never played my cards, because I didn't want to do that again while I was doing China.
I wanted to do China first. I wanted to do Mexico and Canada first. But now that we're all done -- and now what we do is we are going to do Europe. And I had a very good conversation. And I would be very surprised if I had to implement the tariffs.
Big focus.
We're going to actually probably lower taxes, if you want to know the truth. You know, if you take a look at what we've done, we've cut taxes in half. And we've taken in more revenue substantially than we did when the taxes were high. Nobody can even believe it. But we take in more revenue with the big tax cuts -- I mean you were paying really 41% and we brought it down to 21%, and it's sort of lower than that --
Oh, absolutely. And --
And one of the reasons I'd like to see the interest rates lowered, frankly, is because I'd like to refinance the debt and pay off the debt.
We're going have tremendous growth. Joe, when you have all of these trade deals the I've made -- don't forget, I made a $40 billion deal with Japan. I made a massive deal with South Korea. Nobody even knows what the number is, but, you know, it was a horrible deal, now it's a great deal. And then you add Mexico, you add China, you add Canada.
You add all of these other countries. And we have about ten countries that we're dealing with. These deals were horrible. In many cases we didn't even have a deal. They just came in here and took advantage of our country. So -- we have massive potential, massive growth, and you'll see that toward the middle to the end of next year --
Go ahead, Joe. They --
All very different. You have Mini Mike is spending a lot of money. He's got no chance. But he's got a tremendous -- you know, he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for politics, and then -- he went a little off. You should see some of the nice things he said about me before I ran. They're like the nicest.
But he had a deal with Hillary Clinton that he was going to become secretary of State. It was very simple. People know that. And he -- wasn't going to happen. It was going to go to Terry McAuliffe. I mean so they were playing with Michael. And -- it's too bad, but he's spending a fortune. He's making a lot of broadcasters wealthy.
And he's getting nowhere. His ratings are terrible. His -- you look at his numbers. I don't know if Joe's going to limp across the line, but you -- I watch him. I s -- watch him speaking. He can't put together a sentence, but it could be him. And it could be Crazy Bernie. I don't know who it's going to be. Whoever it is, I'm ready.
Go ahead.
Yeah, I know
Yeah.
Very disappointing company. This is one of the great companies of the world, let's say as of a year ago, and then all of a sudden things happen. I am so disappointed in Boeing -- had a tremendous impact. You know, when you talk about growth, it's so big that some people say it's more than a half a point of GDP.
So Boeing -- big, big disappointment to me. Big disappointment.
I am --
I like them a lot. I think we should do some encryption. I think we should -- we should start finding some of the bad people out there that we can do with Apple. I think it's very important. Frankly, I've helped them a lot. I've given them waivers, because I want them -- it's a great company, but it made a big difference.
Now, you know, they compete against Samsung. Mostly Samsung. I guess that would be their number one competitor. That's from South Korea. It's not fair, because we have a trade deal with South Korea, so Samsung would get the no waiver. And they would -- they would have to pay -- tariffs. So I did waivers, but I want them to help us a little bit.
They -- you know, Apple has to help us. And I'm very strong on it. They have the keys to so many criminals and criminal minds, and we can do things. When they had the problem with the -- recently in Florida. I won't go into it, because it's so horrible.
But they could have given us that information. It would have been very helpful.
No, no. I understand --
-- you know what, I understand both sides of the argument.
But if you're dealing with drug lords --
You're dealing with drug lords and you're dealing with terrorists, and if you're dealing with murderers, I don't care. We have to get --
-- we have to find out what's going on.
Well, I met him -- and he told me that I'm number one in the world in Facebook. He sat down. He said, ""Congratulations. You're number one."" Now, I wouldn't be able to say that unless it was --
I'd rather him just do whatever he's going to do. You know, he's done -- he's done a hell of a job, when you think of it. And -- he's going to do what he has to do. I heard he was going to run for president. That wouldn't be too frightening, I don't think. But he does have that monster behind him. He said, ""You're number one,"" and I said, ""That's really nice."" It's always nice to be number one.
You know who number two is?
Modi of India. But he has 1.5 billion people. I have 350. So -- Modi. And we're going there very soon, too --
And by the way, our relationship with India, and again with China and with Japan and with so many countries, is better than it's ever been. Literally better than it's ever been.
Well -- you have to give him credit. I spoke to him very recently, and he's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And -- he does good at rockets too, by the way. I never saw where the engines come down with no wings, no anything, and they're landing. I said I've never seen that before. And I was worried about him, because he's one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius.
You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that -- came up with originally the light bulb and -- the wheel and all of these things. And he's one of our very smart people and we want to -- we want to cherish those people. That's very important. But he's done a very good job.
Shocking how well -- you know, how it's come so fast. I mean you go back a year and they were talking about the end of the company. And now all of a sudden they're talking about these great things. He's going to be building a very big plant in the United States. He has to, because we help him, so he has to help us.
Go ahead.
At some point they will be. We have tremendous growth. We're going to have tremendous growth. This next year I -- it'll be toward the end of the year. The growth is going to be incredible. And at the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that's actually the easiest of all things, if you look, cause it's such a --
-- big percentage.
Well, we're going -- we're going look. We also have -- assets that we've never had. I mean we've never had growth like this. We never had a consumer that was taking in, through -- different means, over $10,000 a family. We never had the kind of -- the kind of things that we have. Look, our country is the hottest in the world.
We have the hottest economy in the world. We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. African American, Asian American. Hispanics are doing so incredibly. Best they've ever done. Black. Best they've ever done. African American. The numbers are incredible. The poverty numbers. The unemployment and the employment.
There's -- there is a difference, actually. But the unemployment and employment numbers for African Americans are the best we've ever had. You know, we just -- came up with a chart, and it was a very important to number to me. African American youth has the highest, by far, unemployment. The best unemployment numbers that they've ever had.
And the best employment numbers. Right now we have almost 160 million people working in the United States, and we've never even been close to that, Joe.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Great Joe.

George W. Bush,United States of America,2004-09-02 00:00:00,"Thank you all.  Mr. Chairman -- Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I am honored by your support, and I accept your nomination for President of the United States. 
When I -- when I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers.  We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor that would make the men of Normandy proud. 
Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them. Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because we have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness in our future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America -- and nothing will hold us back. 
In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb Vice President.  I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, and I am honored to have him at my side. 
I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush.  Americans -- Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our First Lady. 
I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women.  I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends.  And I will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush. 
My father served eight years at the side of another great American -- Ronald Reagan.  His spirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and are in our hearts, and will always define our party. 
Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contest for the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this country in the next four years. 
I believe -- I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach -- so we passed the most important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are making sustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back. 
I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors -- so I brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, and nothing will hold us back. 
I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers -- so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation.  Because we acted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back. 
I believe the most solemn duty of the American President is to protect the American people. If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch. 
I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives.  I believe this nation wants steady, consistent, principled leadership -- and that is why, with your help, we will win this election. 
The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom. 
The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career, often with one company that provided health care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all moms also work outside the home. 
This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take your side. Many of our most fundamental systems -- the tax code, health coverage, pension plans, worker training -- were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared -- and thus truly free -- to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams. 
My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition for our workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world to do business.  To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining federal spending, reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent.  To create jobs, we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy.  To create jobs, we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe.  And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across America. 
Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess -- filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperwork and headache every year. The American people deserve -- and our economic future demands -- a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system.  In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code. 
Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better and higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our community colleges.  I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone, anywhere in the world. 
In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. To stand with workers in poor communities -- and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, and other jobs -- we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we will provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of America. 
As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have told me they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured are small business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. 
We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts, and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs.  We will provide low-income Americans with better access to health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center. 
As I have traveled our country, I have met too many good doctors, especially OB/GYNS, who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now.  And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D. C. 
In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace. 
Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership brings security, and dignity, and independence.
Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is at an all-time high.  Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say: Welcome to my home. 
In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans, and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We'll always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account -- a nest egg you can call your own, and government can never take away. 
In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path -- a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life.
And the path begins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind every parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matter where you live, your school will be the path to promise of America. 
We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help -- and we are providing a record level of funding to get them that help.  In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor -- and this year 90 percent of the students passed state tests in reading and math.  The principal -- the principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way: ""We don't focus on what we can't do at this school; we focus on what we can do. And we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line."" See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations.  And that is the spirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningn nio atrs. We will leave no child behind. 
We are making progress -- we are making progress, and there is more to do.
In this time of change, most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one in four students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we will require a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, and expanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma. 
America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need. 
Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online. The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush. com.
These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face a choice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he now wants to dilute them. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing the marriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them.
Wait a minute, wait a minute: To be fair, there are some things my opponent is for.  He's proposed more than two trillion dollars in new federal spending so far, and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts.  And to pay for that spending, he's running on a platform of increasing taxes -- and that's the kind of promise a politician usually keeps. 
His tax -- his policies of tax and spend -- of expanding government rather than expanding opportunity -- are the policies of the past. We are on the path to the future -- and we're not turning back. 
In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.
Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work.  Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child.  Because -- because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminate against them.  Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges.  And I will continue to appoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law. 
My opponent recently announced that he is the conservative -- the candidate of ""conservative values,"" which must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters.  There's some problems with this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you're not the candidate of conservative values.  If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative values.  If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight years of ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them. 
This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism -- and you know where I stand.  Three days after September the 11th, I stood where Americans died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, ""Whatever it takes."" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, ""Do not let me down."" Since that day, I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America, whatever it takes. 
So we have fought the terrorists across the earth -- not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We have tripled funding for homeland security and trained a half a million first responders, because we are determined to protect our homeland. We are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services. We are staying on the offensive -- striking terrorists abroad -- so we do not have to face them here at home.  And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East, because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail. 
Our strategy is succeeding.
Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaeda, Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups, Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising, Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons, Iraq was a gathering threat, and al-Qaeda was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks.  Today, the government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror, Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders, Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests, Libya is dismantling its weapons programs, the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom, and more than three-quarters of al-Qaeda's key members and associates have been detained or killed.  We have led, many have joined, and America and the world are safer. 
This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. And the toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for terror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. And we know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and we will, confront threats to America before it is too late. 
In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat.
Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, and voted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences. Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office -- a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget the lessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time. 
Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East.  In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people -- yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October presidential election -- a resounding endorsement for democracy.  Despite ongoing acts of violence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are scheduled for January. Our nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, because when America gives its word, America must keep its word. 
As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace.  So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies, and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned. 
Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: ""We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place. The various terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is a test of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories and confronting the evil terrorists.""
That young man is right -- our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for America.  Tonight I want to speak to all of them, and to their families: You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan, and you're making America safer. Because of you, women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more just and will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We will give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory. 
Again, my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congress overwhelmingly passed, $87 billion in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets, and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor.
When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""I actually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it.""
Then he said he was ""proud"" of that vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a ""complicated"" matter. There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat. 
Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us in Afghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. And I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard, and President Kwasniewski, and Prime Minister Berlusconi -- and, of course, Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called American allies, quote, a ""coalition of the coerced and the bribed."" That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others -- allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician.  I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history. America is grateful, and America will not forget. 
The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see me in the Oval Office. They had X's branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had been cut off, by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes. During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America.  I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth. 
Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that a vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical ideology of hate.  They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent.  The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear -- and they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march. 
I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend, Israel.  Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers, and political prisoners, and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advances -- heart by heart, and nation by nation -- America will be more secure and the world more peaceful. 
America has done this kind of work before -- and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to Allied forces, a journalist wrote in the New York Times, ""Germany is -- a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis.  capitals are frightened. In every  headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed."" End quote. Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials.  Fortunately, we had a resolute president named Truman, who, with the American people, persevered, knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because that generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world today. 
The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come easily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations. That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sin of slavery, and set our nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan and Nicaragua and Central Europe and the Baltics -- and that noble story goes on. I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this world. 
This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we kept our faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment, and used it to build a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of our nation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me. 
In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Even when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand.  You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English.  I knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it.  Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called ""walking.""  Now and then I come across as a little too blunt -- and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there. 
One thing -- one thing I have learned about the presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have, people are going to notice them --  -- and whatever strengths you have, you're going to need them.  These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I've tried to comfort Americans who lost the most on September the 11th -- people who showed me a picture or told me a story, so I would know how much was taken from them. I've learned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it is right. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead, who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who are told their dad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their mom or dad.
I've met with the wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings to say that I'm in their prayers and to offer encouragement to me. Where does strength like that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character of a great nation: decent, idealistic, and strong. 
The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced peril together, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection of New York City and they will say: Here buildings fell, here a nation rose. 
We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one. We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry. We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again. We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy with their effort and optimism. And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested and confident nation can achieve anything. 
To everything we know there is a season -- a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time for rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century.  By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a safer world. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generations before us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is the everlasting dream of America -- and tonight, in this place, that dream is
renewed.  Now we go forward -- grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the future of the greatest nation on earth.
God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great country. 
",Remarks at the Republican National Convention,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Gavin Newsom,United States of America,2020-08-12,"Good afternoon. Today, I want to talk about jobs and the economy. I want to talk about the health of California’s economy, the health of our workforce, and the obvious impacts this pandemic has had as it relates to our economic security, our economic prosperity, obviously your economic future. I want to first express a little bit of bias, a little bit of biography because it’s a point of privilege, also a point of passion in my life. Having graduated from college, put pen to paper, was able to get 13 investors to invest a modest amount of money to open up my first business. It was a cause that I had long dreamed of, and it was an extraordinary two year effort to actually manifest.
We opened that first business, a small little retail store in San Francisco with one part time employee, Pat Kelly, and that business grew to many businesses throughout the state of California. At one point, the businesses that I was privileged to be part of employed close to 1,000 people here in the state of California. I say that not to impress any of you, but to impress upon you a passion for entrepreneurialism, a passion and recognition of the passions that are expressed every single day by people that take an idea and put their dream to task and put their lives on the line quite literally, putting their financial future and their family members’ future, co-signing loans, making sure that they’re leveraged so they can get a line of credit and putting all of that out.
And then, of course, dealing with the travails even in a good economy, dealing with the setbacks even in a good economy. The surprises, the things that you never anticipated, never expected. But of course, in this environment with this pandemic, the challenges are more acute and more extraordinary for millions and millions of small businesses throughout the state. For that matter, all throughout the rest of this country. And so, it’s a long way of introducing an expression of deep reverence, deep respect for our small businesses, deep respect, deep reference for those that are working behind those counters not only as entrepreneurs, many self-employed, many with one or two employees themselves, but also the employees that also are supported by the backbone of our economy, our small business ecosystem.
And so I want to talk to you today. I want to talk more broadly to the workforce, and I want to talk more broadly to the economy here. The nation’s fifth largest economy, the great state of California. You can’t begin a conversation about economic development and economic recovery without asserting what I think is universally accepted, at least in the context of those experts that we work with and my own subjective beliefs in that belief, and that is the most urgent economic recovery tool for the business community. The one that we need the most is to stabilize this virus, to bend the curve of this pandemic. To do everything in our power to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. That’s foundational. I don’t think there is fundamentally anything more important for our economic future than this fundamental fact.
In addition, we recognize that anything we do in terms of an economic paradigm should be inclusive. We should be focused on resiliency, not only related to pandemics, but more broadly the macro economic vulgarities of an economy that dons the highs, the lows of the cyclical nature of the economy. Particularly an economy that’s so impacted by international conditions, the state of California. So we want to talk in terms of inclusivity. We want to talk in terms of resiliency. But we also want to talk in terms of the future. I’ll talk a little bit in a moment about some of the work we’re doing on our future of work taskforce. When we talk about future proofing our economy, we’re talking about some of the macro economic trend lines in IT and globalization, demographic trend lines and the like. The plumbing fundamentally of our economy radically shifting underneath us. And that of course has been a trend line for decades. Increasingly, even pre-pandemic, became a headline that has driven a recognition of this hinge moment and a need to be more fluid, more responsive and more resilient in our rulemaking and our approaches to economic growth and economic security. Any strategy also should be focused on the immediate, the near term. Obviously, a focus mindful on what may take a year or two in the medium term and always on the long-term. A sustainable, not just situational, mindset as it relates to economic growth and economic prosperity.
One of the most important actions we’ve taken recently here in the state of California was the development of 100 plus member jobs and economic recovery task force led by some of our nation’s top entrepreneurs. Some of our nation’s most well iconic individuals; from Tim Cook runs Apple to Bob Iger runs Disney. Two home-based companies, two companies we’re very, very proud of. But the frame was not only growth. It wasn’t just highlighting our entrepreneurs and our big business leaders. That task force is also about inclusion. We have a big thrust as it relates to equity, a big thrust as it relates to economic justice, social justice, racial justice.
And so, it’s a remarkable group of individuals that truly represents the diversity of our state. Diversity of viewpoints, diversity of concerns and considerations as it relates to economic recovery. I just want to briefly highlight some of the work that they’ve been doing over the course of last number of months, particularly helping us with our sector specific guidance so that we can modify that original, as we did stay at home order, put out sectorial guidance, industry guidance for a safer reopening. The taskforce has been instrumental in advancing those efforts. They were also instrumental of helping us raise tens of millions of dollars for our wear a mask campaign. Also providing PSA free advertising capacity. Also providing us some of the creative to advance that fundamental campaign that may be the most impactful in terms of getting our businesses back open by mitigating the spread of this disease.
We also launched the Shop Safe Shop Local campaign, #ShopSafeShopLocal, to help support our small business, our micro businesses, our neighborhood businesses, and encourage people to maintain that support through this very difficult and trying time. We also had 90 members of that 100 member task force, which I can assure you it was a remarkable number of people that signed on to a letter agreeing that we needed to advocate for more federal supports for federal stimulus dollars. This was around the times of the last CARE Act fund, but also that letter is instrumentally pointed at jump-starting these current negotiations between McConnell, Speaker Pelosi and others. We’re not giving up on Congress moving forward. Not just president through executive orders, but Congress moving forward to do the right thing in subsequent stimulus support.
We also had the benefit, from this task force, of five subcommittees that have provided dozens and dozens of recommendations that we have put into play in real time and we’ll be advancing over the course of the next weeks, not just months. And I’ll get to that in just a moment. Let me just talk about some specific actions we have taken to support the economy here in the state of California already in play. We’ve already moved forward to simplify accounting methods to reduce tax liabilities for most small businesses. I can get into the details of this, but I really want to get through a long list to give you a sense of the breadth. And in some cases, the depth of some of these efforts so you get a sense of what we are trying to achieve here as a state and the support we’re trying to provide.
We also eliminated, through the budget. I’m very grateful of legislative support for this effort, eliminated that $800 minimum franchise tax for all new startups here in the state of California. So that franchise tax no longer applies for businesses who want to start here in the state of California. We also have allowed small businesses to defer tax payments. This we did a number of months ago, and this has been very, very fruitful. Up to 12 months and up to $50,000 of deferred sales tax payments. That’s a big deal. Again, as this former small business owner, I could deeply appreciate cashflow concerns and issues being able to defer for at least a year up to $50,000. It’s like getting a line of credit against those dollars that are owed and being able to utilize them to pay rent, to pay your employees, to pay for these extraordinary expenses and burdens that have been placed on you.
We also extended the sales tax deadlines during this pandemic as well. Accordingly, we have worked to support the economy by supporting working families. 3.6 million working families have already received $1 billion through our earned income tax program. I don’t know another state that is providing more for working families. These are folks on the edge. These are people working hard. These are families in need. These are direct contributions in their pocket. We had a budget that just passed those dollars being distributed in real time. Over $1 billion in new tax credits. 3.6 million working families that got the benefit of those efforts.
Accordingly, we advanced over just the last 24 month period, but I thought it was important to highlight that we have advanced over $1 billion, unprecedented, in California’s history for low income housing tax credits. And this all goes to jump-starting our economy, jump-starting housing production here in the state. You’ll see those line item here in this slide 18. Bills that we advanced and signed with incredible leadership of the legislature package that we are very proud of to move housing production forward last year. By no stretch of the imagination is that where we are ending our efforts on housing. Quite the contrary. I’ll talk a little bit more about some of those efforts in a moment, but we are fully committed to doing more and better as it relates to housing production here in the state of California. That’s foundational in terms of our economic capacity. Not just our ability to recover from this pandemic, but our ability to be competitive in years to come.
And so, that’s a little bit of highlight on what we’ve done to support the economy. Let’s talk specifically now the work we’ve done to support businesses. One of the programs we’re very proud of, first-in-the-nation, a novel program where we took that entrepreneurial mindset, took pen to paper of sorts and tried to bring it into government. That entrepreneurial mindset worked with credible leadership of FEMA, Bob Fenton, and others, our regional director, created a program to support restaurants. 8,000 jobs have been supported. 5.6 million meals now have been served to seniors that need to quarantine, need to isolate, that don’t have other supports, that can’t get Meals on Wheels. Aren’t getting other meals delivered. This program not only helps our seniors, but it has helped support these restaurants that have just been pummeled by this pandemic and the challenges of opening and reopening all related to the transmission of this disease. First-in-the-nation, Great Plates Delivered…
Of this disease, so first in the nation, Great Plates Delivered program. It’s paying dividends and I’m really proud of that program, proud of those partnerships and proud of that effort, particularly now that we’re seeing other states replicate this model. We’ve waived property tax penalties for small businesses and we created a new small business loan targeting minority and women-owned businesses, micro loans. These are people that can’t get those PPP loans, they couldn’t get the SBA loans that are falling basically through the cracks. Don’t have commercial banking relationships, credit banking relationships, and as a last report need support. Some of that’s first loss support, more access, liquidity to capital, forgive the language, be a little confusing, but the bottom line is tens of millions of dollars. It’s over 100 million now but 75 million in new dollars that we put in to this place and in this space to help our small businesses and provide access and opportunity for loans during this very difficult period of time.
Accordingly we have also focused our efforts on supporting organic businesses that preside or reside here in the state of California. We announced a number of weeks back a program called SafelyMakingCA.org. SafelyMakingCA.org is a platform. I encourage you to take a look at it that encourages you to support small businesses, medium business, manufacturers here in the state of California. It is a fact we are still the largest manufacturing state in America. While manufacturing gets so much attention in other parts of this country, it deserves more attention here in the state of California. We worked with the Manufacturing Association to develop this program with their incredible leader and incredible leadership, CMTA helped us conceive of this new platform. Hundreds and hundreds of small businesses procuring PPE including N95 masks that we are actually purchasing from a business in Santa Clara, California that’s reconstituted its line of small business that is growing in this pandemic, developing tens of millions of N95 masks that we’re procuring, the virtual cycle of sales tax and dollars that flow through that cycle of engagement with the state procurement, through the Office of Emergency Services into a county and a community, creating jobs, creating opportunities, direct and indirect economic supports.
It’s exactly what we want to see more of. Trust me when I say this, this is a point of deep emphasis for us but we have a new platform. We have new programs. We are not just proposing something in this space. We’re actually manifesting something in this space. Not at the scale we need to, but with real progress, not just promotion behind this effort.
Another program we’ve done that I’m very proud of, I long have been an advocate not just for unemployment insurance, I think we need to move towards an employment insurance program in this country. Something I did as may of San Francisco through the last Great Recession, we got a waiver to do a program where we were able to hire employees, many were getting actually less than they would being on unemployment insurance, but they still went back to work for … Well, three reasons. Dignity being the most important. They wanted to look, I remember meeting some workers who said, “You know what? The reason I took this job back through this employment insurance program and I didn’t pick up an employment insurance check is that I wanted to look my kids in the eye and say that I earned these dollars.” That was a touching and profound statement. I think it was Voltaire that said work solves life’s three great evils, boredom, vice and need.
I certainly believe there is dignity with work and people naturally, don’t buy the rhetoric you keep hearing on national news that somehow people are just takers and prefer just to take an unemployment insurance check and somehow we have created a reverse stimulus in this country by providing those $600.00 additional contributions on a weekly basis to your paycheck. That’s nonsense and by the way, overwhelming majority of studies on this bear that out as complete garbage and so there is something about the dignity of work, dignity of being employed, that 99% of workers prefer and I just want folks to know we have a program called our Work Share Program and already it’s supported 54,000 employees, 8,400 employers have taken advantage of this program and if you’re an employer, I encourage you to do the same. You want to keep your employees employed, reach out, go to the covid19.ca.gov website, covid19.ca.gov website. Learn more about this Work Share program already paying dividends. It is an employment insurance program. We employ your employees so we keep them off the unemployment line and it is a program worth scaling and I believe worth mentioning here today.
Accordingly I want to just mention we have 86 active small business centers in the state of California speaking over 31 languages. They have seen not surprisingly a tenfold increase in their financing assistance since the beginning of this pandemic but it’s also the backbone of our small business supports in the state, this network of small business centers and I just want to thank all the employees working in those small business centers for all of their counseling work, all their work just advising and supporting small businesses that have come in record volume in the state and I encourage you as a small businessperson to consider reaching out, learning more about our small business centers that are in your region and in your area.
We can’t talk about business without talking about the workforce and so it is incredibly important for us to highlight some of the work that has been done and some of the work we’re going to be doing as it relates to supporting our essential workforce. Essential workforce broadly defined by providing workers’ compensation which we did through this pandemic, the paid sick leave that we provided in this pandemic for our food service workers, the paid family leave so people can care for their children or if they have a member of their family that is quarantined, they need to have that paid family leave. We advanced efforts in this place.
We also advanced efforts to support our frontline essential workers by providing more support through childcare contributions. Tens of millions of dollars we put in place to support those frontline workers to help them get childcare so they could stay there on the frontlines, that workforce at a time when we desperately needed them. We also created programs you may recall, a hotel program where we subsidized hotel rooms for healthcare workers that otherwise were sleeping in their cars, were scared to death to go back home and expose their families and were going out of pocket staying in hotel rooms or in some cases were in shelters as we discovered and so we created a program to provide housing subsidies or rather hotel voucher subsidies for that workforce and we extended that to agricultural workers as well.
We did cash assistance, direct cash assistance through philanthropy and Chan Zuckerberg Foundation among others to help our skilled nursing facility workers. Tens of millions of dollars in that space as well. Millions of masks. Talk about tens of millions, tens of millions of masks, PPE and other important gloves, gowns, face coverings we sent out to our essential workforce because we were able to procure hundreds of millions of procedure masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks through our large scale purchasing capacity.
We did an eviction moratorium. We talked a little bit about that on Monday. I want to just thank Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, members of the Judicial Council to their credit that are considering extending that moratorium through the end of August. They haven’t done so and I’m not doing this to put pressure on them. I just want to thank them for their very constructive dialogue and engagement. That will give us time working with the legislature to enact an extension of those moratoriums and meet the needs for millions of Californians that are feeling the anxiety and stress in that space.
We also were able to work with some of the largest big banks in the United States on mortgage forbearance. We negotiated that, I think we were one of the first states in the country to do so and I want folks to know that we are working aggressively behind the scenes, can’t make any promises to see what we can do to extend some of the same support. Look, no one’s been more supportive than the California legislature and I want to just thank legislative leadership, the pro tem, speaker, some of the key legislative leaders, Bob Hertzberg and others that have just been proactive and engaged and engaging on the issue of elevating ideas and legislative supports to spur economic growth here in the state of California. We have just a couple weeks left, just over two weeks left in this legislative session and so we have to get work, we have been at work, but we got to roll up our sleeves now and get this package across the finish line.
So a) I want to acknowledge their leadership, all their incredible ideas, the work they’ve already done, the work we did together last year creating that foundation, a predicate for the work that is in front of us. Now let me talk a little bit about that work in front of us. Again, forgive me for being long-winded, perhaps speaking a little bit more quickly but I want to get through this presentation because I think it’s incredibly important to many of you watching and those that will be supported through some of these efforts.
Let’s talk about these efforts. Unspent bond moneys on projects that are ready to go. I always hesitate to say shovel-ready projects because that connotes some of the old stimulus after ’08, but we have a lot of projects that are ready to go that are permitted and could happen. All we need to do is move that money out a little bit quicker, a little bit faster. Hundreds of millions of dollars, in excess of $400 million that readily we have identified to move in this space to accelerate state-funded infrastructure investment, to create jobs in the immediate area. We’re working with the legislature and again, I want to just thank their leadership for presenting ideas and we have confidence we can get some of these over the finish line.
Accordingly, we have a lot of work we want to do on wildfire and green infrastructure investment, hardening our energy grid and we have strategies and plans, legislature has the same and we think we have common ground and can advance some of those efforts. Workforce training is foundational, it’s fundamental. We have been working with our economic taskforce, some of the nation’s leading workforce development leaders are members of that taskforce, and they have come up with some really creative ideas on workforce training. The legislature has their ideas. We have some ideas around skills libraries, I don’t want to get into some of the weeds but we have some really innovative strategies, certification strategies where we’re working with all the stakeholders and I am confident we can get some of this done, we’re making real inroads in terms of finding some common ground in that space. You can’t say enough about time value of money. As someone that years and years ago I think it took a few weeks when I first applied for my business license to open a business, create jobs, create tax revenue for the state, and it took weeks and weeks and weeks to get a simple business license.
That’s absurd and I recognize now my responsibility as governor to make sure that those weeks become days and I want to just thank Alex Padilla, the secretary of state. He’s done an amazing job in the last few years reducing that time, the secretary of state plays a role in this as well as a lot of other state agencies, but we’re not just talking about a simple license to operate. We’re talking about licenses across the spectrum to adapt and adjust and amend operations, particularly in this pandemic environment and so we’ve got to streamline permitting. Doesn’t mean eliminating rules and regulations and don’t read into that. It’s just about time value of money. Just make a decision, let me know what the rules of the road are. Don’t let this linger one week, one month, some cases six, seven, eight months. So that’s fundamental and we have some sectoral streamlining strategies are underway and just want folks to know that. This is a point of real commitment and resolve and we’re going to be at this for years but this is an area we are focused on, particularly now in hard hit sectors of our economy that are going to need the most support to recover from the last six months.
Can’t recover unless you can recover information, data, measure that data, be more customer service oriented in terms of how we provide services in the state. We talked about this on Monday. Across the spectrum, large scale IT, even medium, small scale IT needs to be improved in the state. We can predict where you’ll be, not just wait for your inquiry and respond. That’s why we created this Office of Digital Innovation. That’s why we’re putting together a band of people that are committed to the cause of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, breaking down silos and barriers and processes to do more and do better to meet your needs in a more efficient and effective way so I included that because I think that’s foundational in terms of our economic future, in terms of our workforce as well.
Look, one thing we know, businesses are having a hard time that are on the edge of making a decision on whether or not they can afford to hire someone and so we want to make that a little easier, working again with legislative leaders to develop a new hiring tax credit. A lot of good ideas from the legislature and we have our ideas, our taskforce presented some new ideas as well. We refer to it as a Main Street hiring credit because we really want to focus on small business and when I say small business I mean not just small businesses with 500 or 1,000 employees but small businesses, one or two employees, self-employed that may want to hire a part-time person or may want to hire a full-time person. May want to hire someone that was formerly homeless. May want to hire someone that just came out of the criminal justice system and while we have some programs in this place we want to do more and do better to advance a more comprehensive hiring credit, particularly on sectors of our economy that have been most impacted by this pandemic.
We also want to work, the legislature has come up with some really good ideas and we very much support some of those ideas to conform to the federal PPP taxation. This is the federal loan program. We want to exempt that loan program for California-based businesses from state taxation.
Workers’ protection, we talked about this 10 or so days ago in Stockton, California. I followed up here a few days later talking about the work we need to do to our essential workforce and how disproportionate this impacts the Latino community and the black community here in the state of California. We need to advance more worker protections. Look, if we’re going to eliminate this disease, we want people that have tested positive or been exposed to COVID-19, we need them to isolate. We need them to quarantine, but if you can’t afford to quarantine, you can’t afford to isolate, you physically don’t have the ability to do that at your home, you need protections and that’s why workers’ protections are foundational. Family leave, paid sick leave, workers’ comp. It’s the only way we’re going to succeed here and so for businesses this is essential. It’s not just for workers to reopen but for businesses it’s essential that their workers are healthy and safe and not coming to work because they need that paycheck, sick and then impacting the entire country and impacting the ability for that organization to continue to operate.
So we see this as something that’s very connected to the business community and business needs. Also we want to help with our outreach and I mentioned some of the work we’ve done in this space in terms of the employee toolkits, employer toolkits, know your rights campaigns, all of this culturally competently delivered throughout the state of California so that employees that
… Throughout the state of California so that employees that are entitled to a lot of these programs that actually pay in to these programs are aware that they’re entitled to them, and they don’t have any retaliation. It’s always an exception, but we’ve got to address people that may be a little more abusive to those workers and their rights, and make sure that those workers are empowered and aware, and that’s part and parcel of our efforts to protect workers to more quickly and expeditiously reopen this economy, and beyond even this pandemic. Big awareness campaign, public awareness campaign, we want to continue to do that. More specificity, more nuances. We turn the page, and I’ll get to the latest numbers in a moment, and some of the trendlines are moving in the right direction, how we can more effectively target our public awareness campaigns.
I also want to acknowledge all those caregivers out there. This is personal. My wife, among others, but it’s also a cause my administration holds dear… Chief of Staff, Ann O’Leary, among many others. But I know legislative leaders care deeply about caregiving care economy, which we need to highlight domestic workers and the like. This pandemic’s had a real impact on their lives. There’s a lot of legislative conversations in this space. I want to acknowledge them, thank them for introducing more formerly some strategies for consideration. We want to work together on those efforts accordingly. We also need to protect consumers. We have, as part of our package we introduced earlier this year, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. California can lead in this space, and I think it’s foundational to protecting workers, to protecting a more sustainable framework to reopen our economy that, again, advantages everybody. And so we want to continue to work closely with the legislature in that space.
I mentioned evictions a moment ago, and the work we’re doing. In that space in the past, the work we’ve done with the judicial council and hope is enacted by the judicial council to give us a few more weeks to put together a legislative package. I mentioned this on Monday, some of the work being done in this space, again, I want to just thank number of legislative leaders for their specific ideas, and we continue to have very, including yesterday, constructive conversations in this space. And we will update you as is warranted on that progress. I don’t want to get in the way of the negotiation right now of talking out of school, except to say that we are committed to getting something done over the course of the next few weeks on eviction protections, and addressing the needs for our most vulnerable renters and small landlords as well.
And speaking of that, one of the ideas that we are committed to is accelerating the distribution of the $300 million in our national mortgage settlement funds. The original budget proposed that we would spend that down over the course of a number of years, $75 million in this year, but we now want to accelerate that, and we’re proposing putting all $300 million out this year to address the needs, again, of our most vulnerable homeowners and renters. So this is to really help small landlords, to help renters, and homeowners that have been impacted all within the letter of the law of the settlement related to the mortgage funds, by the way, led by then Attorney General Kamala Harris. We want to thank her. Wouldn’t be having this specific conversation without her leadership in this space. And this is just a demonstrable example of that leadership, and how important it is to come at this time.
And so we want to accelerate those funds. And I think we have a lot of support from the legislature in that effort. Accordingly, we can’t talk about economic growth, economic recovery, as I mentioned a moment ago, without talking about housing. No greater economic stimulus, the virtual cycle of housing growth, housing production, housing starts. We did a lot of things last year on Infill Infrastructure Grants, and more money. Mentioned billion dollars the last few years in tax credits. We also have the ability to move some of our bond funds in this space, and move those dollars, distribute those dollars, sooner. And so we are working with the legislature to do just that, and want to thank, again, legislature for their efforts in this space, and know that we are very committed. We’ve identified well over a $100 million in this space to move quickly and efficiently and effectively out there accordingly.
We have a lot of them bills in the legislature, and I just want to thank the Protem, among others, that have bills on moving housing production, which just simply means get housing built faster. Can’t be more clear about that. Number of bills, I don’t want to attach to any one bill we’re negotiating those points, but the time value of money also includes the time to actually start construction. Once you identify a piece of property, line up the financing, get through all the local permits, the regional permits, the state permits, any federal barriers, and then you’ve got to go… I mean, it’s a labyrinth. And so we have an economic obligate, but also I would argue an ethical one in the context of how housing prices have ravaged the economy in the state over decades, and how we simply have not produced enough housing in the state over the course of decades. We have to address that, and I think some of these bills will move in that direction with caveats, with amendments, with considerations, all stakeholders at the table.
Final couple points I want to make, and I’ll jump briefly into today’s data and then answer any questions, is later this week, we’ll be putting out more detailed plan on closing the digital divide. It’s clear that reforms in the economic space also need to address and adapt to the reality of this pandemic and the conditions this pandemic has created. Digital divide as relates to education, that’s obvious and foundational, but also as it relates to the economy, broadening access to tablets, broadening access to a broadband is fundamental. It’s not just access to broadband, it’s high quality, high speed broadband. That’s also fundamental. And so we’ll be putting out more details in that space later this week, but I wanted to just point them out to here today, as well as recognizing we’re doing a lot more telework.
What are the rules of engagement on telework for employees and employers? And so we’re looking in that space as well, and I want to telegraph that, which relates to teleworking in this state. That we need to, I think, get under the hood and consider some strategies of flexibility that meet the needs and the rights and our responsibility to protect employees… At the same time, recognize these new tools of technology, new tools of engagement, require, perhaps, some new thinking. Speaking of new, you see here briefly, and I’ll jump through just very briefly these numbers, a number, 11,645. It’s the total number of COVID cases that were reported in the last 24 hour period here in the state. Now, I mentioned on Monday that this week, over the next few days, I’m up to 72 hours through tomorrow night, most likely, that we will take all of that backlog, the 295,000 backlog numbers of cases, figure out total number of positives we have, and then begin to stack those positives on the actual dates those numbers came in. So we’re beginning to do that.
But for the purpose of transparency, yesterday, 12,500. Today, 11,645. We’re giving you numbers that represent the actual number of positive cases, and a number that begins the process over a few day period of truing up the total number of positives from that backlog. If you’re following me, I’m impressed and grateful. It’s a long-winded way of saying that the actual numbers today that we are putting out, the 11,645, includes 6,212 backlogged cases, and the actual number today is 5,433. So backlog numbers will come in next couple of days. We will then get through all of that. We’ll true up all these numbers. We’ll get a brand new positivity rate out there for everybody. But know all that is happening on the schedule that we promoted on Monday, and just wanted, for transparency purposes, give you a sense of how many backlog numbers we just added today, but give you a sense that I think is a little bit more optimistic. The 5,400 too high, but a lot lower than we’ve been tracking the last few weeks. Again, another indication that we are turning the corner on this pandemic.
Briefly, let’s follow that up with some other proof points. Hospitalizations. These are the facts. These are the grounding numbers, hospitalizations, ICUs, deaths. These are the lagging indicators, and these numbers obviously very consequential. It’s very encouraging, still, to see the 14 day hospitalization numbers continue to decrease over 19%. 19.3, 19.4% decrease in the last 14 days. Consequence, that decrease… You saw that on Monday, you saw last week, the week prior, see a decrease in hospitalizations… That number, now 5,442, represents about 7% of the healthcare system capacity in the state. 9, 8, now down to about 7% of the capacity. So it relates to ICU admissions. You see similar a trend line. A little even more encouraging than last week… Rather, on Monday. Last presentation on ICU is now 16% decrease on ICU admissions over a 14 day period.
So tracking similarly to the decreases, we’re seeing 19% in hospitalizations as a consequence. Again, looking total capacity, that pie chart, critical care capacity, ICU capacity, now was 23%, 22, now about 20% of the total number of ICU patients, COVID-19 positive patients, in our ICU system. Ventilators, again, north of 13,000 available, doing better than we were a few weeks ago with 11,000 plus ventilators available. As always, again, appreciate you sticking in with me on this presentation. As always, we encourage you to wear a mask. Want to see those numbers continue to go down? Wear a mask. Want to see those numbers continue to go in the right direction? Continue to physically distance. I want to see those numbers continue to go down. As the temperatures go up, try to avoid mixing. I saw the American river the other day, and I might as well been at spring break. Thousands and thousands of people were not minimizing mixing.
Raised little shivers in my spine that here we are making all this progress, and it could be done away in a day, two, a week, two. People begin again to let their guard down. Can’t let your guard down. Got to continue to practice all of these fundamental rules of the road as it relates to what we know works, non-pharmacal interventions to mitigate the spread of this disease, including washing your hands, but not, again, more important than wearing a mask. And so I want to encourage you to do just that. Final point I just want to say on businesses, and I have a mantra. It’s a bias, and forgive me, it is a bias, but that bias, I wear, again, through personal experience, not just intellectualization as governor of the state of California cares deeply about economic growth and economic prosperity.
And that mantra is simple, that you can’t be pro- job and anti-business. And I think it’s just fundamental that when we talk about job growth and job creation, that we support our small businesses. We support those folks that take risks and put everything on the line. The second point I want to make is businesses can’t thrive in a world that’s failing, and that’s also fundamental. And so if it is indeed a truism that you can’t be pro-job and anti-business, and businesses can’t thrive in a world that’s failing, then we have to recognize that the new paradigm on economic growth is growth and inclusion. And that’s the foundation. That’s the framework to which we believe the values of the state of California are advanced, our principles are advanced, and longterm sustainable economic recovery can be found. Growth and inclusion. And so in conclusion, I wanted to make that point and thank everybody on our task force, thank everybody in the legislature for all of their ideas, and the business community for their ideas, and cities large and small all across the state that have submitted their ideas to help us in the pursuit of these efforts.
And close to open up for questions by saying one final point. That list, while for many of you seemed exhaustive and exhausting, it is not an entire list of ideas that we are currently considering and negotiating with the legislature. There are a number of very potent, powerful, and very insightful ideas that are being promoted by members of the legislature that are not on that list that we continue to engage on. And I just want to acknowledge that, and let you know that it is not intentional, that neglect. I just wanted to put together a list today where I think we’ve made a lot of progress, but no, that is by no means an exclusive list of the considerations that we are advancing over the course of this legislative session that concludes on August 31st. With that, I’ve concluded my presentation. Happy to answer questions.
Last I looked, it’s August of 2020, and my understanding is in January, toward end of January, 2021, that decision would need to be made. That’s a way of saying this. It’s not way of being flippant. It’s a way of being factual and very transparent. Absolutely focused on bending this curve, mitigating the spread of this disease, getting our economy moving again, getting people back to work, getting our kids, including, dare I say selfishly, my kids, back to school, and getting back to a semblance of normalcy, and looking forward to turning the page as a nation, and working very, very closely with my old friend of over a quarter of a century, the next Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
We have urgency capacity with the legislature, so the answer is there’s a way of addressing that, but let me also just make this point. We were able to take executive action through the emergency orders that are afforded to me during this pandemic right now, and that we’ve done that. And we advanced those same orders in terms of capacity that we provided the Judicial Council to do the same they did. But right now we are working in the spirit of collaboration, cooperation, partnership with the legislature, and a lot of stakeholders on some nuances that I think are incredibly important to work through.
And so I’m confident that we’ll get to where we need to go, but I’m very cognizant, and I think it’s a very good question. Very cognizant of that timeline, and that’s why we’re hoping it does get extended to September 1st. That will give us the opportunity to move with the urgency that’s required, and to do so in a way where we can address that concern around a gap by January 1st. So we are working through that, and we have a pathway that we believe to put something in place that would work very nicely through that September 1st deadline.
So let me bring up the slide on hospitalizations. This is what gives me some confidence we’re moving in the right direction. We have COVID-19 hospitalization numbers that, again, have decreased 19% over the course of the last 14 days. The last four presentations that I’ve made, public presentations, you’ve seen similar decline in hospitalizations. After significant growth, you may recall month or so ago that was very, very difficult. Very early July, where we saw hospitalization growth over a 14 day period, North of 50%. Now we’re seeing declines in hospitalizations. Accordingly, in ICU admissions, trend lines are favorable. So specific to your question, these are specific proof points that connect to some optimism that what we are doing as a state. And I say, we, the people of the state of California, 40 million strong. What you are doing is working. Wearing those face masks is responsible, I believe disproportionately, for this trend line. Socially distancing, physically distance, responsible for this trend line.
People that are becoming more cognizant of mixing outside of their households, more cognizant of letting down their guard even within their household, you’re responsible. They are responsible for these trend lines. The worst mistake we can make, I’ve said this in the past, is run the 90 yard dash where we think we’ve got this and we walk away and we revert back to the way things used to be. And that’s why we have to be very cautious and very deliberative as we begin the modification. Now, you specifically asked, in addition to what gives you some optimism, including by the way, the total case rates. I’m going to give you the new positivity numbers. I want to make sure those are 100% accurate when we work through the details of that backlog, that’s forthcoming. But you’ll also note that we have been consistently engaged, and I mentioned this in the outset of the presentation today, with our recovery task force on sectoral guidelines for safely reopening.
We did that when we put up guidelines, we’ve been doing that consistently, working with health officials all up and down the state of California, and we are consistently iterating, we are consistently modifying those orders. Just recently, we put out new orders as it relates to sports, high school sports, youth sports, broadly defined clubs sports. We put it out for higher education. We are constantly making adjustments mitigating based upon factors and criteria and conditions. We continue to work with our advisory committees, continue to work with health officials and a big part of these efforts moving forward. When, not if, when we make subsequent modifications to these sectorial guidelines is a commensurate effort with much more focus, much more intention and more deliberative mindset than was the case a number of months ago when we did the original modifications of public education and awareness around the power and potency of continuing, continuing, even if we reopened a sector of our economy.
Continuing to enforce a consciousness, literally and figuratively, enforce a consciousness of promotion of these efforts to mitigate the spread and transmission of disease. Because one thing we know is this can flare up in a moment and there is no having made it as it relates to being successful in this space, as it relates to transmission of this disease unless and until we get a vaccine, unless and until we have kind of therapeutics that can significantly mitigate the impacts of this disease. And so until that point, even if we modify, we have to maintain our vigilance and we’ll need a commensurate public awareness campaign and enforcement campaign with any subsequent modifications to ensure that.
Well, you may be the only one that hasn’t, unless you just did. And that is only slight exaggeration. And I can’t be more pointed privately than I am being publicly. That’s not what I’m focused on right now. I’m focused on what I need to be focused on and that’s you and your health. That’s the economy and its needs and the support that we need to provide small businesses and the priority, get our kids back in school. That’s what matters to you and that’s what matters to me as my top priority. Look, as it relates to, I don’t want to belabor and get into too much personal issues, but as you said, or I said, thank you for reflecting on it that I’ve known Kamala Harris before she was district attorney in San Francisco, before I became mayor. We of course served, were elected the same day when she was district attorney when I was mayor.
I had the privilege of working with her for two terms. When she ran for attorney general to be a supporter and advocate for her campaign. I ran myself with lieutenant governor worked with her as attorney general and supported her efforts very proudly so when she ran for the US Senate and now as governor, been working very collaboratively in a very supportive way with her team and with her in the United States Senate. I accordingly and not surprisingly based upon that history, based upon that relationship and in my insight in terms of the character and the competency and her devotion to the cause that I think unites the vast majority of us. Her empathy, her compassion, her learnedness or doggedness or commitment to solving problems, not just identifying problems. Her executive experience, not just legislative experience made it an easy decision when she announced her campaign for president, for me to come out and endorse her.
Couldn’t be more proud of that. And so you can imagine how proud I’m feeling, American people are feeling not just Democrats. I have a few Republican friends that actually had a smile on their face yesterday about her candidacy now for the next vice president. So it is a proud moment, historic and it’s a very meaningful. I’ll close on this, forgive me, meaningful moment for California. I’m privileged, I sit at a desk that Earl Warren sat at. Former, by the way, assistant district attorney in Alameda County, where Kamala Harris started. Obviously, made his way to governor and became Supreme Court justice. Where Ronald Reagan sits. It’s a proud place to sit there were great work was done by Pat Brown and Jerry Brown, among many other, Schwarzenegger. Proud of the work and partnership now with Davis Wilson and others that have been incredibly supportive.
California has a proud history of electing some outstanding leaders. And I got to say also a point of pride, not just being a Californian, but growing up in San Francisco and a lot of these leaders emanated from San Francisco. And if you followed San Francisco politics, you know it’s not for the timid. And it doesn’t surprise me at all that so many of our nation’s great leaders, Nancy Pelosi being top among them, emanate from that extraordinary city. The birthplace of my kids, my father, my grandfather, not only myself.
We talked a lot about that on Monday and put out specific slides and presentations on Monday of what it would take to draw down that $ 300. That was the original proposal based upon the executive order the president put out to receive the federal support, the supplement on the unemployment insurance. I commented that it would cost the state about $2.8 billion a month. $2.8 billion a month to meet the rules and regulations that were assigned to that original executive order. Yesterday as you know, it’s been well reported, there was a modification to the executive order, at least, an assertion that there would be guidelines forthcoming to modify it where it’s no longer a $400 contribution. 600, we believed it to be 400, 25% would have to be picked up by the state. We talked about how that was simply not possible for the state even as large as ours to be able to do.
Now, that 400, 600, 400 has now dropped to 300. One thing we are doing is, as I say, don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Now, I don’t look at it as a gift horse. We’re federal taxpayers. I’m a taxpayer, you’re a federal tax payer as well. This is what federal government is all about, time and need, meeting the needs of the American people. This is when we’re all in it together. And traditionally those needs are met by forwarding money from the federal government that has a printing press, states simply do not, to provide for the needs of the American people in the most direct and impactful way. And we were very proud and pleased and very thankful of Congress, the president, for endorsing the CARES Act, for getting that $600 contribution. I think it’s substantially mitigated the economic consequences of this pandemic.
Even during that difficult period of time, that maintained itself at a level that otherwise would never have. I think it has a historic blunder if we are unable to accommodate the needs of tens of millions of Americans with subsequent supplemental on unemployment insurance. And I believe personally and professionally that $300 is simply inadequate to do that, to help support small businesses, to help support economies, large and small across state, and very directly help support individuals and their families that are vulnerable to evictions, that are vulnerable to bill collectors, vulnerable in this climate. And so we continue to advocate for more federal support. We continue to be strong and assertive, and I take a backseat to no one going back months in advocating for a new CARES Act, supporting state and local government as well as individuals related to the unemployment insurance efforts. And we’ll continue to make our voice heard.
I had a very good, very detailed, very comprehensive call with Speaker Pelosi yesterday on this topic specifically, and answer to your question of what are we doing. And know this, forgive the long windedness, that we are working with our team if indeed, the gift horse comment, we only get $300 how we can process that $300 as quickly and efficiently as possible so at least we get those dollars out as we wait for either a deal with the current administration or a deal with the next administration in January. Here’s the report back, the ability to do so can happen relatively easily, relatively easily. You’d go from 600 to 300 if the rules of the requirements do not change, meaning the rules for eligibility don’t change. The unfortunate part is in the executive order that has now been changed, the eligibility rules have also changed.
And when you introduce new eligibility rules into these ancient systems, and trust me, California is not the only one, it creates a processing problem that can delay the distribution of these checks. And you know this well because you’ve seen governors of all political stripes make this crystal clear to the administration. So we are also encouraging the administration. We have made it clear to our partners at FEMA and we have made it clear to a lot of our federal partners that if you’re going to move forward, if you want these dollars to have the impact that you intend them to have, we’re grateful to take those dollars. We happily will accept them. We believe they’re not enough, but you can’t change the eligibility rules in a way that will impact our capacity to get these dollars in the pockets of people that need them the most as quickly as we otherwise could.
We talked a lot about that on Monday. Dr. Ghaly talked even more detailed last Thursday and last Tuesday. And forgive me, just in the spirit of the work that was presented and work that has been done including some that we socialized on Monday, we made it crystal clear that our commitment is not just to piecemeal a solution and have now addressed the backlog. We made that clear on Monday. But to build a new strategy, a parallel strategy. And I also mentioned this Monday, to create a separate system on top of CalREDIE. Now, it’s connected, but that would absorb a COVID-19 focus in a forward minded way. It is clear the CalREDIE system does simply does not have the capacity to scale as we had hoped for. We will reform that. We have mitigated that as we speak, we’ll reform that in the medium term with this parallel strategy.
And then in the longterm, we have Amy Tong and others that run our technology department, that are putting together a package of longer term reforms to make sure that we’re not back in this situation, the next governor is not back in this situation. That we have a legacy of learning from these challenges and fixing them once and for all. Well, I believe that may have been the last question. Thank you all for your time and your patience. Thank you again for your vigilance. Thank you all for doing what you can and what you have to mitigate the spread and to see this transmission begin to subside modestly. We continue to encourage you to be vigilant, stay safe, obviously stay healthy and stay ever vigilant about how easy this disease can transmit itself. Thank you all for the privilege of your time. Look forward to coming back talking in the next couple of days, a little bit more about digital divide, updating you on all of these numbers and more. Take care.
",California Governor Gavin Newsom August 12 Press Conference Transcript,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/california-governor-gavin-newsom-august-12-press-conference-transcript
John F. Kennedy,United States of America,1961-12-06 00:00:00,"Mr. President, and gentlemen: I understand that President McKinley and I are the only two Presidents of the United States to ever address such an occasion. I suppose that President McKinley and I are the only two that are regarded as fiscally sound enough to be qualified for admission to this organization on an occasion such as this. I have not always considered the membership of the NAM as among my strongest supporters. I'm not sure you've all approached the New Frontier with the greatest possible enthusiasm, and I was therefore somewhat nervous about accepting this invitation, until I did some studying of the history of this organization. I learned that this organization had once denounced on one occasion--I'll quote--""swollen bureaucracy"" as among the triumphs of Karl Marx, and decried on another occasion new governmental ""paternalism and socialism."" I was comforted when reading this very familiar language to note that I was in very good company. For the first attack I quoted was on Calvin Coolidge and the second on Herbert Hoover. I remind you of this only to indicate the happy failure of many of our most pessimistic predictions. And that is true of all of us. I recognize that in the last campaign, most of the members of this luncheon group today supported my opponent, except for a very few--who were under the impression that I was my father's son. But I hope that some of your most alarming feelings of a year ago about the imminent collapse of the whole business system if I was elected have been somewhat lessened. We have selected, I think, able men who I hope you have come to have a regard for, to serve in the responsible positions of the government. One of them here, our distinguished Secretary of Commerce, Governor Hodges, who had a long career in business; Secretary Goldberg, who I think has earned the respect of business as well as labor; Secretary of the Treasury Dillon and his Under Secretary Mr. Robert Roosa who was the Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Mr. Robert McNamara, whom many of you know, the Secretary of Defense; Mr. John McCone, who is the head of the Central Intelligence Agency succeeding Mr. Dulles; and Mr. Rusk, Secretary of State--I think they're all men of experience and also, I think, they're vitally interested in the maintenance of all kinds of freedom in this country. I think that while we may not have been together a year ago, we are together now, and I will be the President of the United States for the next three years, and I am most anxious that while we may not agree on all matters, that goodwill at least will prevail among us and that we will both recognize that those of us who work in the national government, and all of you, are motivated by a desire to serve our country. Our responsibilities are different, but I believe that we can have a period, in the next few years, of cooperation between business and government in order to advance the common interest. I have read about the feeling of some businessmen that we are anti-business, and I would think that a moment's thought would show how really untrue that must be. And I say it, really, for three reasons. In the first place, we are committed to the defense of freedom around the world. When business does well in this country, we have full employment, and this country is moving ahead, then it strengthens our image as a prosperous and vital country in this great fight in which we are engaged. When you do well, the United States does well, and our policies abroad do well. And when you do badly, all suffer. Secondly, we're unable to maintain the kind of high employment which we must maintain, unless you are making profits, and reinvesting, and producing; and therefore as we are committed to the goal--and we must all be in this country, of trying to make sure that everyone who wants a job will find it, then quite obviously we must make the system work, and the business community must prosper. And thirdly, and to put it on its most narrow basis, we are--in the national government, and I know--a rather unpopular partner in every one of your businesses. Our revenues come from you. When you are making profits, then we are able to meet our bills. When you fail, then we fail. So for every reason, government and business are completely interdependent and completely involved. And while we may differ on the policies which may bring this country prosperity, there is no disagreement, I am sure, on either side, about the tremendous importance of you gentlemen moving ahead, and prospering, and contributing to the growth of this country. And I hope, if nothing else, that my presence here today indicates that my remarks represent the views of all of us who occupy a position of responsibility in Washington today. It's not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor of building a prosperous America, in a world of free and prosperous states, of making the most of our human and material resources and avoiding the harmful effects and fluctuations of inflation and recession, are of course matters of the greatest importance to us all. And it's not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor proceeds under conditions today more fraught with peril than any in our history. As communism continues its long-range drive to impose its way of life all around the world, our strongest desire is not unnaturally to seize the initiative, to get off the defensive, to do more than react to the Soviets. But while this is not an unreasonable urge, its concrete application is more difficult. In the military arena, the initiative rests with the aggressor--a role that we shun by nature and tradition--and our alliances are largely, therefore, defensive. In the paramilitary arenas of subversion, intimidation and insurrection, an open and peaceful society is again at a disadvantage. But there is one area, in particular, where the initiative can and has been ours--an area of strategic importance in which we have the capacity for a still greater effort--and that is in the area of economic policy. The Marshall Plan was an example of our initiative in this area. So were Point 4 and OECD and the Alliance for Progress. This year's new long-range program to aid in the growth of the underdeveloped regions of the world, and the unaligned nations can bring us still further gains--not merely as a blow against communism but as a blow for freedom. Of equal if not greater importance is the stunning evolution of Western European economic unity from treaty to concrete reality. And it is the success of this still-growing movement which presents the West, at this time, with an historic opportunity to seize the initiative again. The United States is, in fact, required to do so for its own self-interest and progress. The Communist Bloc, largely self-contained and isolated, represents an economic power already by some standards larger than that of Western Europe and gaining to some degree on the United States. But the combined output and purchasing power of the United States and Western Europe is more than twice as great as that of the entire Sino-Soviet Bloc. Though we have only half as much population, and far less than half as much territory, our coordinated economic strength will represent a powerful force for the maintenance and growth of freedom. But will our strength be combined and coordinated--or divided and self-defeating? Will we work together on problems of trade, payments and monetary reserve--or will our mutual strength be splintered by a network of tariff walls, exchange controls, and the pursuit of narrow self-interest in unrelated if not outright hostile policies on aid, trade, procurement, interest rates and currency?This is not a debate between ""deficit"" nations and ""surplus"" nations. It is not speculation over some ""grand design"" for the future. It is a hard, practical question for every member of the Western community-involving most immediately for this nation our policies in two mutually dependent areas: our balance of payments and our balance of trade. While exaggerated fears can be harmful, we would not inspire needed confidence abroad by reigning satisfaction with our international balance of payments position. In essence, that position reflects the burden of our responsibilities as the Free World's leader, the chief defender of freedom and the major source of capital investment around the world. As the cost of these responsibilities grows, and is not offset by foreign expenditures here, the monetary deficit in our relations with the rest of the world grows, except to the extent that our trade surplus  can increase with it. During the previous three years, as competition in international markets increased, in spite of the fact that we had a generous balance in our favor in trade, our trade surplus did not keep pace with our needs. At the same time, higher interest rates in other countries as well as speculation in the price of gold attracted some American short-term capital away from our shores. Our balance of payments was in deficit at a rate of nearly 4 billion dollars a year; and, with its consequences extended by a weakened confidence in the dollar, we suffered over that 3-year period a net loss of 5 billion dollars in our gold reserve. The complete elimination of this problem is clearly some time off--but so are any ultimately dangerous consequences. The United States still holds some 43% of the Free World's monetary gold stock, a proportion far larger than our share of its trade and clearly sufficient to tide us over a temporary deficit period--and I emphasize the words temporary deficit period--while we mount an offensive to reverse these trends. Our exports and export surplus have both been rising. The net claims of Americans against foreigners have doubled during the last decade, and the annual increase in the value of our assets abroad--which now total nearly 45 billion dollars and must always be put in the balance sheet, when we're considering the movement of gold and dollars in the value of our assets abroad--has regularly exceeded our payments deficit. Contrary to the assertion that this nation has been living beyond its means abroad, we have been increasing those means instead. This year, moreover, our wholesale prices have been steady. In fact, in spite of the recovery, our wholesale prices are a fraction less than they were in February, and in a very real sense, for the last three years, the United States has had generally stable prices. Confidence in the dollar has been upheld--the speculation fever against the dollar has ceased--the outflow of gold has been reduced from 2 billion dollars in the ten months before February 1961, to 450 million dollars in the last ten months and, due partly to the temporary decline in imports that accompanied the recession, our general payments deficit in 1961 will be less than half of the 1960 deficit. There is cause for concern, in short, but I do not believe that there is cause for alarm. We should be blind neither to our basic strengths nor to our basic problems. A long-term deficit requires long-term solutions, and we must not be panicked by setbacks of a short-run nature or the inevitable results of a reviving economy which has increased our imports and therefore leaves us in a less favorable position than we might have expected two or three months ago. For negative, shortsighted remedies will do more to weaken confidence in the dollar than strengthen it; and this Administration, therefore, during its term of office, and I repeat this, and make it as a flat statement-has no intention of imposing exchange controls, devaluing the dollar, raising trade barriers, or choking off our economic recovery. What we will do, and have been doing, is to take a series of positive steps to reduce our outpayments and to increase our receipts from abroad. First of all, we recognize, as already stressed. that this country cannot solve this problem alone. Our Allies have a vital interest in its solution. Because, let me repeat, if it were not for our national security commitments abroad, which defends our own interests and that of our Allies, the United States would have gold pouring in, rather than pouring out. It is this commitment which is extremely large and constant which gives us our problem, and should be so recognized. Our Allies, therefore, have a vital interest in the solution. Thus we have sought to increase the share of the contribution which other industrialized states are making to the less-developed world; and are seeking their assumption of a larger share of the cost of our joint defense requirements. We lose three billion dollars a year because of our defense expenditures. It costs us hundreds of millions of dollars to keep our troops in Western Germany. We lose nearly three hundred million dollars a year to France alone because of our defense expenditures in those areas. That three billion dollars, therefore, represents a charge in the interests of our national security, which is vitally important. That drain is serious. And it was because of that reason that President Eisenhower last year suggested the exceptional step of bringing back our dependents from Western Europe which would have saved two hundred and fifty million dollars. But three billion dollars represents the contribution which we make to our defense establishments abroad. The reason why the British, as you know, have been considering withdrawing some of their troops from bases stationed around the world is because of their balance of payments difficulty. The reason that they have been reluctant to station additional troops in Western Germany has been because of the same reason. In other words, therefore, the matter which we are now discussing, of trade, involves not only our economic wellbeing but the basic commitments of the United States to dozens of countries around the world. Unless our balance of trade, and our surplus, is sufficient, for example, to pay for this three billions of dollars, then we have no remedy but to start pulling back. So that for those who address themselves to this subject in the coming months, they must realize that it goes to the heart of our survival as well as our economic vitality. We are working with foreign governments now and central banks on new techniques for dealing in foreign currencies; on coordinating our development aid, fiscal, debt management, monetary and other policies through the OECD; on preparing a new stand-by lending authority for the International Monetary Fund; on the prepayment of our Allies' long-term debts during this period of adverse trends; and on increasing the proportion of their own military procurement in the United States, a very important move, because of the arrangements that have been recently made, that is expected to cut our payments deficit by at least another half a billion dollars next year. Secondly, to hold our own outlays abroad to the absolute essentials, we have emphasized procurement in this country for our military aid and overseas defense, and insisted upon it for three-quarters of our economic aid. This means that our economic aid to these countries does not go as far as it once did. The South Koreans can buy fertilizer from Japan at half the cost that they can buy it here in the United States, and much less shipping. But because we are determined to protect our gold, and therefore our dollar, we have imposed the Buy American policy which means now that our losses because of economic aid abroad, our general program which amounts to about four billion dollars, is now down as far as our dollar loss to five hundred million dollars, and we are hopeful that we can squeeze it even down further. We have also substituted local currency expenditures for dollar expenditures to cover local costs wherever possible; and sought to discourage  heavy expenditures abroad by tourists to supplement restrictions already placed on military families. I will say I was alarmed to hear the other day of a study in the Defense Department of this question of dependents abroad, which indicated that those who had no dependents abroad spent more money abroad than those with dependents, so it indicates that for every solution there are additional problems. Third, to encourage a greater movement of funds in this direction, and to discourage transfers in these other directions, we have set up a new program to attract foreign visitors; secured passage of a tax exemption encouraging foreign central banks to invest their capital in U. S. securities; kept our own short-term interest rates high enough to avoid unnecessary outflows; and urged our Allies to free their own private capital for investment here. At the same time, we have directed the Treasury, for the first time in a generation, to buy and sell foreign currencies in the international exchange markets so as to strengthen its ability to offset unfavorable developments affecting the value of the dollar. Fourth, we have asked the Congress-and this is a matter which is controversial and to which this group has taken exception-we have asked the Congress to remove the artificial tax preference for American investment in highly developed countries with no capital shortage, and the unjustifiable tax avoidance loopholes available to those Americans investing in so-called ""tax haven"" nations. We do not seek to penalize those who wish to invest their capital abroad. We are committed to the free flow of capital, but we also want to make sure that our tax laws do not encourage the outward movement of capital in a way which does not serve our national purpose. I am aware that many of you will argue that the investment abroad of these funds will mean that ultimately and in the long run these moneys will be coming back. But how long a run? And how long can we afford, without taking every responsible step, to try to bring this in balance in the short run? We can't wait till 1970, if we're losing two or three billion dollars a year. And we're now, for the first time, down to about sixteen billion, nine hundred million dollars in gold in the United States. So that I want to emphasize that however unsatisfactory you may feel it is, it is not being done to harass business, but only because it represents one additional effort to try to bring the dollar into balance. And if we can increase our trade so that our surplus in trade is sufficient to make up these figures, then this kind of tax would be unnecessary. Or, if this organization has some other plan or program--which does not affect our national security--which is more equitable, we'll be glad to listen to that. But we are concerned that while capital moves freely, the tax policies do not stimulate it. And I emphasize this in saying again that I do not believe that exchange controls, based on the experience of the British and others, and our unique role as the banker of the world, would be either workable or helpful. But the recent flow of our capital to nations already fully developed has been a serious drain--in the shortrun--on our current balance of payments position. The eventual return from that capital is no help to us today. And at a time when we're hardpressed to pay for the maintenance of our forces in Europe without unreasonably increasing our payments deficit and our gold outflow, I am sure you must realize that it makes no sense to be encouraging an exodus of capital through tax laws that were more appropriate at a time when Europe was deficient in capital. You probably are familiar with these figures: in 1960, the long-term outward flow of capital funds was a billion, seven hundred million dollars. The return was two billion, three hundred million dollars, and therefore you might argue that we're getting more back than we're sending out. But when those figures are broken down, we see that the outward investment into the developed countries, such as Western Europe, was a billion, five hundred million dollars, and the return was only one billion dollars, a loss therefore in dollars and potentially in gold of a half a billion dollars to these countries, while in the underdeveloped countries where we would like to see American capital be invested, we took in one billion, three hundred million and invested two hundred million dollars. So that I would say, gentlemen, that all of the proposals which we will have to put forward in the coming months and years to try to bring this into balance--and I will say that we are going to reduce without weakening our defenses our expenditures for military purposes from three billion dollars to two billion dollars, we do have to use every available means that we have. And if this organization has suggestions as to how it may be done, we want to hear them. The best way, of course, is by increasing our exports. Fifth, and most important of all, we are seeking to increase our exports--and thus our surplus of exports over imports. I shall discuss our opportunities, but it is worth while recounting now that we have embarked on a stepped-up campaign of export promotion and trade fair exhibits--increased our agricultural exports--and to indicate the kind of problems that we're going to have, we send to Western Europe in agricultural exports nearly two billion dollars, which is one of our great dollar earners. We take in, in agricultural exports from Europe, only about 80 million dollars, a balance of trade for us of nearly a billion, 920 million dollars. And yet, as the Common Market begins to get more and more developed, with all of these countries beginning to face surplus problems, there isn't any doubt that one of our most important problems in maintaining this kind of dollar flow would be to maintain the free flow of our agricultural commodities into the Common Market. There's going to be no more difficult task than that, and therefore we have to recognize that this, too, may affect our balance of payments. We have broadened the Export-Import Bank's loan guarantee system--created a new program of export credit insurance-and in a variety of ways sought to help you to keep American prices competitive. This requires--if we are to avoid the inflation that will price our goods out of the world markets-price and wage restraint by both industry and labor, and responsible budget policies by the government. It requires--if we are to offer modern products efficiently produced at a low cost--a higher rate of investment in new equipment, encouraged by the fullest use of existing capacity in a strong recovery, by the investment tax credit now pending before the House Ways and Means Committee, and by the depreciation reform now under study and already put into effect on textile machinery. This organization has taken a position against our tax credit, and the reason is that you do not feel it is sufficient and you support a much more general overhaul of our depreciation. I support that, too, but our tax credit will cost a billion, 800 million in our revenue. We have suggested--and I know this has been unpopular--certain taxes to make up that revenue, because quite obviously we cannot carry out a tax reduction, in these critical times, without budget problems as difficult as they are. Therefore, while we would like, under ideal conditions, and had hoped, for example, to have a surplus this year before our additional expenditures for defense in July, it is very difficult for us to send up a broad tax depreciation scheme which might cost three billion dollars, with the expectation that other tax reductions would be added to it, at a time when we balance our budget with the greatest difficulty. So that we're not unsympathetic, and I can think of very few tax changes that would be more useful to the country in stimulating employment and keeping us competitive, particularly with Western Europe. And the only reason we have not gone further in it, and the only reason we have limited ourselves to the proposal which is now before the House Ways and Means Committee, is because we do not have the available revenue to provide for a tax reduction this year. So that I'm hopeful, in making your position known to the Congress this year, that while you will continue to commit yourselves to depreciation changes--and as I say, we have made some progress in textiles-you will also recognize what our budgetary problems are, and work with us in attempting to get the best arrangements we can at this time, and plan for more satisfactory arrangements in the future. In short, achieving a healthy equilibrium in our international accounts depends in part upon the cooperation of our Allies-in part upon action by the Congress--in part upon the self-discipline exercised by this Administration in its executive and budgetary policies --and in part upon you and other members of the business community.  I recognize that your efforts will be governed in part by the kind of atmosphere the government can help to create. That Is. why we intend to submit our balanced budget. The government must not be demanding more from the savings of the country, nor draining more from the available supplies of credit, when the national interest demands a priority for productive, creative investment--not only to spur our growth at home but to make sure that we can sell, and sell effectively, in markets abroad. But your own responsibility is great--and there are three things in particular that you can do: be competitive, through lower costs and prices and better products and productivity. Be export-minded. In a very real sense, the British used to say they exported or died. We are going to meet our commitments. We've got to export. And we have to increase our exports, and however impressive it has been in the past, it must be better in the future for the security of this country. And finally, be calm, in the sense of refraining from talk which really does not represent the facts, and which causes a concern about where we are going abroad. It is my hope that when we submit our balanced budget in January, that those who look at our fiscal situation from abroad and make their judgment, will recognize that we are in control, that we are moving ahead, and that the United States is a good bet. All of us must share in this effort--for this in part, as I have said, is a part of the national security. And I don't want the United States pulling troops home because we're unable to meet our problems in other ways. But we can be calm because our basic international position is strong--this year's deficit will be lower than last year's--our gold stores are large and the outflow is easing--we are going to make progress next year in diminishing it still further--we will submit a balanced budget--we are not undergoing a damaging inflation. We can, over the next few years, offset with the help of our Allies a billion dollars, as I have said, of our $3 billion overseas defense outlays; reduce, with the help of the Congress, the money which goes because of tax advantages; cut back still further that portion of our foreign aid procurement which is not already spent here; and take the other steps I have mentioned, including an increase in our exports, for which all the additional tools we need are well within our reach. One of those tools--one which we urgently need for our own well-being--is a new trade and tariff policy. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act expires in June of next year. It must not simply be renewed-it must be replaced. If the West is to take the initiative in the economic arena--if the United States is to keep pace with the revolutionary changes which are taking place throughout the world--if our exports are to retain and expand their position in the world market--then we need a new and bold instrument of American trade policy. For the world of trade is no longer the same. Some 90% of the Free World's industrial production may soon be concentrated in two great markets--the United States of America and an expanded European Common Market. Our own example--of 50 States without a trade barrier behind a common external tariff--helped to inspire the Common Market. Our support--ever since the close of World War II-has been thrown behind greater European unity. For we recognized long ago that such unity would produce a Europe in which the ancient rivalries which resulted in two world wars, for us as well as for them, could rest in peace--a Europe in which the strength and the destiny of Germany would be inextricably tied with the West--and a Europe no longer dependent upon us, but on the contrary, strong enough to share in full partnership with us the responsibilities and initiatives of the Free World. Now this new ""house of Europe"" that we sought so long, under different Administrations, is actually rising, and it means vast new changes in our outlook as well. With the accession of the United Kingdom and other European nations to the Common Market, they will have almost twice as many people as we do--it will cover nations whose economies have been growing twice as fast as ours--and it will represent an area with a purchasing power which some day will rival our own. It could be--it should be--our most reliable and profitable customer. Its consumer demands are growing--particularly for the type of goods that we produce best, for American goods not previously sold and sometimes not even known in European markets today. It is an historic meeting of need and opportunity; at the very time that we urgently need to increase our exports, to protect our balance of payments and to pay for our troops abroad, a vast new market is rising across the Atlantic. If, however, the United States is to enjoy this opportunity, it must have the means to persuade the Common Market to reduce external tariffs to a level which permits our products to enter on a truly competitive basis. That is why a trade policy adequate to deal with a large number of small states is no longer adequate. For almost thirty years, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act has strengthened our foreign trade policy. But today the approaches and procedures provided for in that Act are totally irrelevant to the problems and opportunities that we confront. Its vitality is gone--a fresh approach is essential--and the longer we postpone its replacement, the more painful that step will be when it finally happens. For this is no longer a matter of local economic interest but of high national policy. We can no longer haggle over item-by-item reductions with our principal trading partners, but must adjust our trading tools to keep pace with world trading patterns--and the EEC cannot bargain effectively on an item-by-item basis. I am proposing, in short, a new American trade initiative which will make it possible for the economic potential of these two great markets to be harnessed together in a team capable of pulling the full weight of our common military, economic and political aspirations. And I do not underrate at all the difficulties that we will have in developing this initiative. I am not proposing--nor is it either necessary or desirable--that we join the Common Market, alter our concepts of political sovereignty, establish a ""rich man's"" trading community, abandon our traditional most-favored-nations policy, create an Atlantic free trade area, or impair in any way our close economic ties with Canada, Japan and the rest of the Free World. And this, of course, is a problem of the greatest importance to us also. We do not want Japan left out of this great market, or Latin America which has depended so much on the European markets. It may find it now increasingly difficult because of competition from Africa to sell in Europe which could mean serious trouble for them and therefore for us in the long run both political as well as economic. I am not proposing--nor is it either necessary or desirable--that in setting new policies on imports we do away altogether with our traditional safeguards and institutions believe we can provide more meaningful concepts of injury and relief, and far speedier proceedings. We can use tariffs to cushion adjustment instead of using them only to shut off competition. And the Federal government can aid that process of adjustment, through a program I shall discuss further tomorrow--not a welfare program, or a permanent subsidy, but a means of permitting the traditional American forces of adaptability and initiative to substitute progress for injury. For obviously our imports will also increase--not as much as our exports, but they will increase. And we need those imports if other nations are to have the money to buy our exports and the incentive to lower their own tariff barriers. Because nobody is going to lower their barriers unless the United States makes a bargain with them which they feel to be in their own economic interest. We need those imports to give our consumers a wide choice of goods at competitive prices. We need those imports to give our industries and defense establishments the raw materials they require at prices they can afford--and to keep a healthy pressure on our own producers and workers to improve efficiency, develop better products, and avoid the inflation that could price us out of markets vital to our own prosperity. Finally, let me make it clear that I am not proposing a unilateral lowering of our trade barriers. What I am proposing is a joint step on both sides of the Atlantic, aimed at benefiting not only the exporters Of the countries concerned but the economies of all of the countries of the Free World. Led by the two great Common Markets of the Atlantic, trade barriers in all the industrial nations must be brought down. Surely it will be said that the bold vision which produced the EEC will fall short if it merely transfers European protectionism from the national to the continental level. But if we can obtain from the Congress, and successfully use in negotiations, sufficient bargaining power to lower Common Market restrictions against our goods, every segment of the American economy will benefit. There are relatively few members of the business community who do not or could not transport, distribute or process either exports or imports. There are millions of American workers whose jobs depend on the sale of our goods abroad--making industrial sewing machines, or trucks, or aircraft parts, or chemicals, or equipment for oil fields or mining or construction. They may produce lubricants or resin; they may dig coal or plant cotton. In fact, the average American farmer today depends on foreign markets to sell the crops grown on one out of every six acres he plants--in wheat, cotton, rice and tobacco, to name but a few examples. Our consumers, as mentioned, will benefit most of all. But if American industry cannot increase its sales to the Common Market, and increase this nation's surplus of exports over imports, our international payments position and our commitments to the defense of freedom will be endangered. If American businessmen cannot increase or even maintain their exports to the Common Market, they will surely step up their investment in new American-owned plants behind those tariff walls so they can compete on an equal basis--thereby taking capital away from us, as well as jobs from our own shores, and worsening still further our balance of payments position. If American industry cannot increase its outlets in the Common Market, our own expansion will be stifled--the growth target of 50% in the sixties, adopted last month by the 20 nations of OECD for their combined gross national product, will not be reached-and our business-community will lack the incentives to lower prices and improve technology which greater competition would otherwise inspire. The industries which would benefit the most from increased trade are our most efficient--even though in many cases they pay our highest wages, their goods can compete with the goods of any other nation. Those who would benefit the least, and are unwilling to adjust to competition, are standing in the way, as the NAM Economic Advisory Committee pointed out last year, of greater growth and a higher standard of living. They are endangering the profits and jobs of others, our efforts against inflation, our balance of payments position, and in the long run their own economic wellbeing because they will suffer from competition in the U. S. inevitably, if not from abroad--for, in order to avoid exertion, they accept paralysis. Finally, let me add, if we cannot increase our sales abroad, we will diminish our stature in the Free World. Economic isolation and political leadership are wholly incompatible. The United Kingdom, faced with even more serious problems in her efforts to achieve both higher growth and reasonable balance of payments, is moving with boldness, welcoming, in the Prime Minister's words, ""the brisk shower of competition."" We cannot do less. For if the nations of the West can weld together on these problems a common program of action as extraordinary in economic history as NATO was unprecedented in military history, the long-range Communist aim of dividing and encircling us all is doomed to failure. In every sense of the word, therefore, Capitalism is on trial as we debate these issues. For many years in many lands, we have boasted of the virtues of the marketplace under free competitive enterprise, of America's ability to compete and sell, of the vitality of our system in keeping abreast with the times. Now the world will see whether we mean it or not--whether America will remain the foremost economic power in the world--or whether we will evacuate the field of power before a shot is fired, or go forth to meet new risks and tests of our ability. The hour of decision has arrived. We cannot afford to ""wait and see what happens,"" while the tide of events sweeps over and beyond us. We must use time as a tool, not as a couch. We must carve out our own destiny. This is what Americans have always done--and this, I have every confidence, is what we will continue to do in each new trial and opportunity that lies ahead.

Hilary Benn,United Kingdom,2015-12-03,"Conference, I want to begin by saying thank you.
To all our great Labour councillors and leaders for the work they do to stand up for Labour values in difficult times, to all the members of our team in the Commons and the Lords, and to everyone on the Policy Commission.
Last Thursday the people of Scotland made their decision. They voted against separation, but they also voted for change.
In years to come, this will be seen as a moment in our history when the ground shifted beneath our feet.
A moment – uncertain and exhilarating in equal measure – but also full of opportunity. A moment to lift up our eyes.
We get the message about the distance and, at times, the alienation that too many people feel from politics, and we have a plan to radically transform our political system so that people can see that change is coming.
It is no wonder there is discontent. We see Tory Ministers on the television telling us that the economy is doing fine. There’s nothing to see here. Everything is OK. Move along.
It just shows how out of touch they are.
People working hard day after day, putting in the hours, doing their best for their family, but finding it tough. Pay not rising enough to meet gas and electricity bills.
Nearly one and half million people on zero hours contracts, not knowing from one week to the next how much they will earn and for those on the very lowest incomes, David Cameron’s bedroom tax. Pushing families into a spiral of debt.
It’s a rotten policy that comes from rotten values with no regard for decency and security.
Well, Conference, we have different values. We reject the bedroom tax and we will scrap it.
And what about our broken housing market? Housebuilding at its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s.
Young people doing all they can to save, but knowing that their dream of owning a home is moving further and further out of reach. So they end up renting, and often find themselves paying off someone else’s mortgage, rather than one on a home of their own.
They probably have a short term tenancy and worry that the rent may jump up, even if they get a new contract.
And if their children are about to start primary school, what kind of security and stability is there if they may be forced to move away from friends and neighbours next year?
We all hear these stories, but this government doesn’t get it.
Well we do – and that’s why we are determined to introduce three year tenancies; to put a ceiling on rent increases; to scrap lettings agent fees for tenants; and to build at least 200,000 homes a year by the end of the next Parliament.
Because we know that our home is where we feel most secure.
And how will we do this? By being bold and by offering a different kind of politics. By giving people the responsibility to make it happen and the means to do so.
So instead of communities feeling that they can’t influence where new homes go because developers ignore the sites the council has identified, and instead try to build somewhere else.
Instead of communities saying that the design is poor, the rooms are too small, and the GP surgeries, roads and schools won’t be there.
And instead of them thinking that even if the homes are built, that their children or friends or neighbours will never get one of them.
Instead of all of this, we will give communities, as Sir Michael Lyons’ report will recommend, the powers they need to tackle land banking; put together the sites; get the design right; put in the infrastructure; and work with small and medium-size and large builders to build the homes that local people need where local people want.
And Conference, we’ll work with councils so that they can build more council houses.
Let’s be proud of the Labour councils already leading the way and outbuilding Tory councils.
The building of social homes by Labour councils on a scale not witnessed for a generation.
Conference, the problem with housing is a symptom of the problem with our politics. People feel distant from decisions that affect their daily lives. They don’t feel in control and they want a bigger say.
That’s why the ground is shifting. So we will build a new politics that works for people rather than just telling them that’s how things must be.
After all it’s where we started as a movement and how we first won the people’s trust.
Our fellow citizens who went to the polling stations four days ago spoke not only for themselves but for the whole of the United Kingdom.
Labour will honour the promise we made to Scotland and we will offer a new deal to England too.
The people of England have been very patient and in that very English way, they are now saying “Excuse me, but what about us?”
Well, we are listening and that’s why Labour will offer England a new deal that will pass power down, money down, responsibility down.
I want cities and counties, towns and districts, parishes and neighbourhoods to make more decisions for themselves and to have more control over the money they raise and contribute.
But I want that to be fair, because what we have now certainly isn’t.
Look at the shameful and deliberate way the Tories have taken most money away from the most deprived communities.
They’re cutting spending power for every household in the ten most deprived areas in England by sixteen times as much as the ten least deprived. Sixteen times.
They’ve targeted Labour Liverpool and Hackney and Knowsley and Birmingham while at the very same time they’ve actually given increases to Tory Elmbridge, Surrey Heath and Wokingham.
Rotten values once again. It’s not fair and we will change it. We will make sure that the money we have is fairly shared. We will make sure devolution goes hand in hand with redistribution from each according to their ability to contribute, to each according to their need.
That’s why we plan to take £30 billion from Whitehall over five years and pass it to local communities – to city and county regions across the length and breadth of the land to: give them the means to create jobs; help people into those jobs; train them in the skills they need for those jobs, invest in the trams, the buses, the railways and the roads to help them get to work and businesses to thrive, and build the homes for those workers and their children.
That’s why we’ll say to local authorities: “Help us to commission our new Work Programme.”
That’s why we will give local areas control of the funding for further education for 19 to 24 year-olds.
That’s why we will put together the money for health and social care so that local communities can provide better integrated care for the old, and for those with long-term conditions and disabilities.
Why should our mums and our dads be sent to hospital or kept there for want of a grab rail or someone to help them get dressed in the morning?
After all, isn’t that what we want for them, and for us, when our time comes?
And by doing this we will help communities to build a stronger economy, a stronger society and a more equal one too, so that not only does London get investment and flourish, but Leeds and Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle, Sheffield and Bristol, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, Cornwall and Essex.
Our new deal is for all parts of England. Conference, this will be the biggest economic decentralisation in a century. But it won’t be enough.
We will go further in changing the way decisions are made so that we can free local communities, the people of England, to shape their own destiny.
Not something cooked up in corridors of Whitehall, but a deeper, more profound change involving people from every part of the country.
A national debate – leading up to a Constitutional Convention – as fervent and as involved as the one that paved the way for devolution in Scotland.
This isn’t about the long grass; it’s about the grass roots telling us what they want in the long term. A Convention with a purpose.
Change that is a means to an end. No longer “what will you do for me?” but “what shall we do for ourselves?”
The change we need to build the homes, generate renewable energy, create jobs, give our young hope, overcome poverty, care for our community and one another.
So, Conference, change is coming. Change that devolves power but which also binds our country together.
Every part of our United Kingdom – side by side, shoulder to shoulder. England and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
And despite the cynics and the critics, it’s everyone’s responsibility to stand up for our democracy. To cherish our democracy. To have faith in our democracy because we know it’s how we built the better society we became, and how we will build the better society of tomorrow.
Yes, there is so much more to do, but the next time someone tells you that getting involved, doing your bit, standing up, getting organised, voting doesn’t make any difference, look them in the eye and say “It isn’t true.”
And tell them this. 70 years ago Europe lay in ruins. We had huge debts and money was short, but faced with this, the British people chose to put their trust in us because they wanted to change the country.
It was a Labour government which started building homes for the returning troops and for those whose homes had been bombed, which strengthened the welfare state, and which gave life to our precious National Health Service.
It’s why we will fight to the death to save it.
People came together to change their own lives and the lives of their neighbours. And how did they do it?
By drawing on compassion for each other and a burning desire to make things better, using the most powerful weapon of all in a democracy: ideas; a piece of paper and a pencil. Cross after cross after cross.
That was how the Scottish people made their decision last Thursday and that is how the British people will make theirs next May.
We know how much this matters. We know how hard the fight will be, but conference, we also know that the greatest victories are won in the toughest circumstances.
So let’s give people hope and let’s go out there and win.
Thank you.
",2014 Speech to Labour Party Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/hilary-benn-2014-speech-to-labour-party-conference/
Abraham Lincoln,United States of America,1862-12-01 00:00:00,"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:
Since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed, and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light He gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way all will yet be well.
The correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect made by the House of Representatives near the close of the last session of Congress. If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent would soon recede from that position, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country. But the temporary reverses which afterwards befell the national arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.
The civil war, which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states and between parties or factions in such states. We have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution. But we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this Government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Her Majesty's Government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the United States and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens.
The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the Stade dues has been carried into full effect under the act of Congress for that purpose. A blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil war occurring in a country, where foreigners reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There is still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the Government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those states are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.
I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May, 1861, prevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charleston from leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees.
Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of African descent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad--some from interested motives, others upon patriotic considerations, and still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments--have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand, several of the Spanish American Republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these circumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any state without first obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen; and I have at the same time offered to the several States situated within the Tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Hayti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I regret to say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to some others, nor so willing as I think their interest demands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this respect is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these countries from the United States.
The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution.
A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending with the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European States remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.
During the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent States of our own continent, but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so intimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile. The commission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada closed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the convention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint commission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. I have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is being extended across the Russian Empire. The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions have remained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally admitted into the Federal Union.
The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminish the burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end can not be adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries--results which can not fail to be auspicious.
The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor.
The suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges.
A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely maintained.
Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?
I know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such associations the Government might furnish circulating notes, on the security of United States bonds deposited in the Treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges.
A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them.
The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and balance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were derived from customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public lands, $152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans in all forms, $529,692,460.50. The remainder, :$2,257,065.80, was the balance from last year.
Other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I invite your most candid and considerate attention.
The reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith transmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through those Departments. Nor could I give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them.
It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficiency in the Department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that Department in the interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a correspondence through the Department of State with foreign governments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received.
I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service.
The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands:
The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st July, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were $137,476.26 -- a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the same period. The homestead law, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash can not be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the General Land Office and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market. The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not really coincident at the beginning point, the Treasury report including a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the Interior and not by the Treasury.
The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to the United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required.
In the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was wholly unexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been prodded. It is estimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not to be stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau from different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The State of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property. The people of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the State as a guaranty against future hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details. I submit for your especial consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done.
I submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific Railroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject. The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I respectfully ask attention to it.
To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to be organized.
The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this Department has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States.
Also, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory.
The creation of this Department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people.
On the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted. In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called ""compensated emancipation.""
A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability. ""One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever."" It is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever-enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States is well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people.
In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I can not improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat:
One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This I think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country can not do this. They can not but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them, Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you.
There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave country. and we shall find a little more than one-third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place.
But there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east by the Alleghanies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people, and will have 50,000,000 within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United States--certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than 75,000,000 people. A glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic. The other parts are but marginal borders to it. the magnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources. In the production of provisions grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region has no seacoast--touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people now find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco; but separate our common country into two nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.
And this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky or north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south, are indispensable to the well-being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region. Which of the three may be the best is no proper question. All are better than either, and all of right belong to that people and to their successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world. They, too, and each of them, must have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary.
Our national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the land we inhabit: not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost. Our strife pertains to ourselves -- to the passing generations of men -- and it can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation.
In this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States:
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of both Houses
concurring), That the following articles be proposed to the legislatures (or conventions) of the several States as amendments to the
Constitution of the United States, all or any of which articles, when ratified by three-fourths of the said legislatures (or conventions ), to be
valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, viz:
ART. -- . Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before the 1st day of January., A. D. 1900, shall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to wit:
ART -- All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be compensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall be twice accounted for.
ART. -- Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without the United States.
I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it could not continue.
Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some would perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation; some would abolish it gradually and with compensation: some would remove the freed people from us, and some would retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize and act together. This would be compromise, but it would be compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions. if the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of the States.
As to the first article, the main points are, first, the emancipation; secondly, the length of time for consummating it (thirty-seven years); and, thirdly, the compensation.
The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangement -- in fact, from the necessity of any derangement -- while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its consummation. They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate the length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great, and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time, or by degrees extending over the whole or any part of the period, and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and generally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the compensation. Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object. Yet the measure is both just and economical. In a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property -- property acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true for having been often said that the people of the South are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than are the people of the North; and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South has been more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then, for a common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge?
And if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it? Let us consider it, then. Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether if that measure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave States the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so, the measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able. The war requires large sums, and requires them at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large. But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds even any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden, instead of thirty-one millions as now. And not only so, but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first national census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a population of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad national homestead, is our ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native born away. But such is not our condition. We have 2,963,000 square miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a population averaging 73 1/3 persons to the square mile. Why may not our country at some time average as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage? If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union. Several of our States are already above the average of Europe 73 1/3 to the square mile. Massachusetts has 157; Rhode Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and New Jersey, each 80. Also two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below, the former having 63 and the latter 59. The States already above the European average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before, while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our country in natural capacity for sustaining a dense population.
Taking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and ratio of increase for the several decennial periods to be as follows:
Year Population Ratio of increase. Percent.
This shows an average decennial increase of 34.60 per cent in population through the seventy years from our first to our last census vet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of these seven periods is either 2 per cent below or 2 per cent above the average, thus showing how inflexible, and consequently how reliable, the law of increase in our case is. Assuming that it will continue, it gives the following results:
Year Population
And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord among us. While it can not be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious.
The proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of the country. With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 per cent per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than 6 per cent -- has run faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt.
This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection -- the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when we number but 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It will be a saving of both.
As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such. The third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported and the American voters, through their representatives in Congress.
I can not make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor colonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious.
It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed -- the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market -- increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor.
But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land. Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make them any more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole country, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now having more than one free colored person to seven whites and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition. The District has more than one free colored to six whites, and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. But why should emancipation South send the free people North? People of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from. Hertofore colored people to some extent have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution. But if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from. Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured, and the freedmen in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved. And in any event, can not the North decide for itself whether to receive them?
Again, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last spring?
What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery here.
The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption.
Nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.
And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both.
This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force. It is much, very much, that it would cost no blood at all.
The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It can not become such without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and afterwards three-fourths of the States. The requisite three-fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever.
I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nation, nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display.
Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here -- Congress and Executive can secure its adoption? Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not ""Can any of us imagine better?"" but ""Can we all do better?"" Object whatsoever is possible, still the question recurs, ""Can we do better?"" The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.
Fellow-citizens, we can not escape history. We of this Congress and this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless.

Rishi Sunak,United Kingdom,2020-03-26,"Good afternoon.
Today I can announce the next step in the economic fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, with new support for the self-employed.
Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of Coronavirus so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the NHS’s ability to cope.
At every point, we have followed expert advice to be controlled in our actions – taking the right measures at the right times.
We are taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by increasing the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line to give people the care they need.
That is why it is absolutely critical that people follow our instructions to stay at home, so we can protect our NHS and save lives.
Our action plan to beat the pandemic is the right thing to do – but we know people are worrying about their jobs and their incomes.
Working closely with businesses and trade unions, we have put together a coherent, coordinated and comprehensive economic plan – a plan which is already starting to make a difference:
big employers like Brewdog, Timpsons and Pret have already said that our Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme means they can furlough thousands of staff, rather than laying them off. And we are publishing this evening detailed guidance on how the scheme will operate so that other businesses can take advantage, too
small businesses are already benefiting from Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans of up to £5 million, which are interest free for 12 months – with 30,000 enquiries in just four days
local authorities are already informing more than 700,000 retail, hospitality and leisure businesses that they will pay no business rates this year
and the new hardship grants scheme, providing cash grants of up to £25,000 for the smallest businesses, is now up and running
So if any business is struggling, and worrying they may need to lose staff, I would urge you to log on to businesssupport.gov.uk, and look very carefully at what support is available before deciding to lay people off.
I’m proud of what we’ve done so far, but I know that many self-employed people are deeply anxious about the support available for them.
Musicians and sound engineers; plumbers and electricians; taxi drivers and driving instructors; hairdressers and childminders and many others, through no fault of their own, risk losing their livelihoods.
To you, I say this: You have not been forgotten. We will not let you behind. We are all in this together.
So, to support those who work for themselves, today I am announcing a new Self-Employed Income Support Scheme.
The government will pay self-employed people, who have been adversely affected by the Coronavirus, a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits over the last three years, up to £2,500 a month.
This scheme will be open for at least three months – and I will extend it for longer if necessary.
You’ll be able to claim these grants and continue to do business.
And we’re covering the same amount of income for a self-employed person as we are for furloughed employees, who also receive a grant worth 80%.
That’s unlike almost any other country and makes our scheme one of the most generous in the world.
Providing such unprecedented support for self-employed people has been difficult to do in practice.
And the self-employed are a diverse population, with some people earning significant profits.
So I’ve taken steps to make this scheme deliverable, and fair:
to make sure that the scheme provides targeted support for those most in need, it will be open to anyone with income up to £50,000.
to make sure only the genuinely self-employed benefit, it will be available to people who make the majority of their income from self-employment
and to minimise fraud, only those who are already in self-employment, who have a tax return for 2019, will be able to apply
95% of people who are majority self-employed will benefit from this scheme.
HMRC are working on this urgently and expect people to be able to access the scheme no later than the beginning of June.
If you’re eligible, HMRC will contact you directly, ask you to fill out a simple online form, then pay the grant straight into your bank account.
And to make sure no one who needs it misses out on support, we have decided to allow anyone who missed the filing deadline in January, four weeks from today to submit their tax return.
But I know many self-employed people are struggling right now, so we’ve made sure that support is available.
Self-employed people can access the business interruption loans.
Self-assessment income tax payments, that were due in July, can be deferred to the end of January next year.
And we’ve also changed the welfare system so that self-employed people can now access Universal Credit in full.
A self-employed person with a non-working partner and two children, living in the social rented sector, can receive welfare support of up to £1,800 per month.
The scheme I have announced today is fair.
It is targeted at those who need it the most.
Crucially, it is deliverable.
And it provides an unprecedented level of support for self-employed people.
As we’ve developed the scheme, I’m grateful for the conversations I’ve had with the Federation of Small Businesses, the association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, and a range of trade unions, including the Trades Union Congress.
But I must be honest and point out that in devising this scheme – in response to many calls for support – it is now much harder to justify the inconsistent contributions between people of different employment statuses.
If we all want to benefit equally from state support, we must all pay in equally in future.
These last ten days have shaken our country and economy as never before.
In the last two weeks we have put aside ideology and orthodoxy to mobilise the full power and resources of the British state.
We have done so in pursuit of a single goal: to protect people’s health and economic security, by supporting public services like our NHS, backing business, and protecting people’s jobs and incomes.
What we have done will, I believe, stand as one of the most significant economic interventions at any point in the history of the British state, and by any government, anywhere in the world. We have:
pledged that whatever resources the NHS needs, it will get
promised to pay 80% of the wages of furloughed workers for three months up to £2,500
deferred more than £30 billion of tax payments until the end of the year
agreed nearly 17,000 Time to Pay arrangements for businesses and individuals
made available £330 billion of loans and guarantees
introduced cash grants of up to £25,000 for small business properties
covered the cost of statutory sick pay for small businesses for up to two weeks
lifted the incomes of over four million households with a nearly £7 billion boost to the welfare system
agreed three-month mortgage holidays with lenders and nearly £1 billion more support for renters through the Local Housing Allowance
and today we’ve announced one of the most generous self-employed support schemes in the world
Despite these extraordinary steps, there will be challenging times ahead. We will not be able to protect every single job or save every single business.
But I am confident that the measures we have put in place will support millions of people, businesses and self-employed people to get through this, get through it together, and emerge on the other side both stronger and more united.
Thank you.
",2020 Statement on the Self-Employed and the Coronavirus,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2020-statement-on-the-self-employed-and-the-coronavirus/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-07-24,"Well thank you very much everybody. Please. This promises to be a very big and very important meeting, so bear with me. Take a little while, but it has to do with a thing called drug pricing and as you know Congress has been working on this for decades and decades and we are now doing something that is going to be incredible for the American public. So today I’m taking a bold and historic, very dramatic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs for American patients and American seniors. Under the last administration alone, drug prices rose a staggering 55%. Thanks to my administration’s aggressive actions since taking office, we have successfully lowered drug prices for the first time in 51 years, but this reduction is still not close to what I want, what I expect, and I’m looking for help for our great seniors especially in particular, that’s what we’re doing today. You’ll hear something which will be very shocking, we’re doing things that nobody thought could be done and it’s going to have an incredible impact.
Unfortunately we’ve been waiting for Congress to take action for many decades to reduce drug prices for more than just a small handful of people, but even the small handful of people never got price reductions, and I’m unwilling to wait any longer. Therefore today I’m signing four sweeping executive orders that will lead to a massive reduction in drug costs, massive. We’ve already gotten them down a little bit, but that’s not good enough, first time in 51 years as I said, but that’s not good enough. They represent the most far-reaching prescription drug reforms ever issued by a president. Nothing even close.
Joining us for this important occasion are our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex, where’s Alex? Alex, thank you, Alex Azar. CMS administrator, both doing a great job, Seema Verma. Seema, thank you Seema. FDA administrator Dr. Stephen Hahn, Stephen who is really speeding up the process of therapeutics and vaccines and I just heard from some of the big drug companies in there saying the FDA has really been moving the process along. Very important, Stephen. Can you move faster please? Okay. Thank you, great job. We appreciate it. And administrator of Health Resources and Service Administration Tom Engels. Tom, thank you. Thank you very much Tom for being here.
We’re also pleased to have with us our great governor from the state of Florida, incredible state, incredible guy, Governor Ron DeSantis, thank you Ron very much. Appreciate it and you’re going to say a few words in the end, good. Representative Matt Gaetz, our friend. Where is … Hi Matt, you’re so quiet back there today. I’ve never seen you like that. Thank you Matt, great job you’re doing. Appreciate it very much. Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Jose Oliva. Jose, thank you Jose very much, good job, and many other state and local leaders, we have a lot of them. Thank you very much being here.
The four orders I’m signing today will completely restructure the prescription drug market in terms of pricing and everything else to make these medications affordable and accessible for all Americans. The first order will require federal community health centers to pass the giant discounts they receive from drug companies on insulin and EpiPens directly to their patients. You know, insulin became so expensive people weren’t able to use it. They desperately needed it. We have it to a level that you’re not going to believe. EpiPens, likewise. You’ve been reading horrible stories about EpiPens over the last six, seven years. Horrible, horrible, horrible increases, where they went from almost nothing to massive amounts of money. We’re changing that right now. These providers should not be receiving discounts for themselves while charging their poorest patients massive full prices. Under this order the price of insulin for affected patients will come down to just pennies a day, pennies a day from numbers that you weren’t able to think about. It’s a massive cost savings.
The second executive order I’m signing this afternoon will allow states, wholesalers and pharmacies to do something other politicians have promised for decades and decades but never done. They never delivered. We will finally allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where the price for the identical drug is incredibly lower. It’s a difference like you wouldn’t believe. 70%, 80%, 90%, 30%, but massively lower than the identical drug made in the same plant, the same factory, the same exact drug, same everything, same box, same pill, and yet it’s 50, 60, 70% lower and this is something that Ron and I have been discussing from the time Ron got elected and I’ve been wanting to do it and it takes a long time from a legal standpoint and we’ve got it all worked out.
So we are going to be getting massive drug savings in Florida and other states and we’ve had numerous states that wanted to do it. Ron really was at the forefront, I will say that, but you have other states that have caught on, it’s caught on very quickly. Didn’t take them long to figure that one out, Ron. It’s too obvious. We pay for all of the research and all of the developments and foreign countries pay absolutely nothing and our consumer gets charged. This has been going on for decades. The American people pay an average of over three times more for medicine than the Canadians. Many people go to Canada, I see it all the time, they go to Canada, buy drugs and then they come back, prescription drugs because they save so much money. The trip is well worth it.
The Obama-Biden administration pledged to end this unfairness and allow drug importation but they never got it done. They were unable to get it done. They didn’t get a lot of things done, but under my administration we’re standing up to the lobbyists and special interests and fighting back against a rigged system. Rigged system, you’ve heard that word before. I am unrigging the system that is many decades old. We’re doing something that should have been done a long time ago.
The third revolutionary order I’m signing today will prevent middlemen and women I guess, but you’ve heard about the middleman, right? The middleman that makes so much money, nobody knows who they are, nobody has any idea who they are, they make more money perhaps than even the drug companies themselves, and the drug companies in all fairness to them, big pharma and they’re doing a great job on the vaccines, they’re doing a great job on therapeutics I can tell you because I deal with them a lot, but I think the middlemen make more money than they do and they don’t do much. Maybe they don’t do anything. Some people say they don’t do anything. Nobody even knows who they are, but the middlemen are making a fortune and pharmacy benefit managers and people are just bilking Medicare patients with these high drug prices while they pocket gigantic discounts, gigantic discounts. The amount of money they have made over the decades is too incredible even to speculate or say, it’s massive.
Some very rich people are not going to like me very much today, I can tell you. I probably know them very well, I probably see them in Palm Beach, but nobody ever talks about who they are. Everyone, I hear the middlemen for years, the middlemen. Right Alex? He doesn’t know who they are either but he knows they’re rich. They’re not going to be so rich anymore because the money is going down to reduce the price of drugs, prescription drugs. So that’s a big thing. That’s a tremendous step. It should have been taken a long time ago but they have a great deal of power and I don’t have to tell you how many phone calls I’ve had in the last few days when they heard I was going to be doing this. I’ve heard from people that I haven’t spoken to in a long time. Frequently drug companies give these middlemen discounts of up to 50% on the price of prescription drugs, but too often those discounts are not passed on to the pharmacy counter, meaning the people. This rule will pass, those billions and billions of dollars a year, I mean many, many billions a year in discounts onto patients, directly onto patients, saving Americans with high drug costs thousands of dollars a year. Individual people will make thousands of dollars a year.
You’re not going to believe the impact the things we’re talking about today are going to have. Mark Meadows, our great chief is sitting here and he’s just … Can’t even believe it because he was a very successful congressman, he’s been after people to do this for a long time and they never got to the gate. I understand why, tremendous pressure. Tremendous pressure put on the president not to do it.
The fourth and final order I’m signing today is the granddaddy of them all. We’ll end global freeloading on the backs of American patients and American seniors. For decades, our citizens have paid the highest prices for drugs, prescription drugs anywhere in the world and it’s not even close. Foreign nations have paid vastly less
“Foreign nations have paid vastly less for the exact same drug again, and the exact same box, from the exact same plant, from the exact same company. They would pay 10%, 20%, 30% what our people are paying. A pill that would sell for $1 in certain countries, I won’t name them. They’re all allies, right? They call them allies. I call them so-called allies, but a pill that would cost a dollar could be 7, $8 in our country, same exact pill. We pay 80% more than nations like Germany, Canada and others for some of the most expensive medicines, identical in all respects. This means that Americans are funding the enormous cost of drug research and development for the entire planet. We are bearing the entire cost of all of this. They’re bearing none. They say, “This is what we’re going to pay.” In some cases, it’s a socialist country. So we’re paying to reduce drug prices in a socialist country. How does that work? How does that work?
And these are things that should have been done a long time ago. And even from our standpoint, we would have done it more quickly, but we have to go through vast amounts of waiting periods, waiting times, and this is an incredible day. This is just a big day. It is a big day. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. We incredibly and foolishly bear the full cost of all research and development, which is massive. In all fairness to the drug companies, can take 15 years to get something approved, billions and billions of dollars for a simple drug. It also means that the US taxpayers are effectively subsidizing the socialist healthcare systems of foreign welfare states and many other countries. We will end that abuse and restore the principles of free enterprise, but this doesn’t even have to do with free enterprise. This has to do with common sense and courage, to be honest, and courage.
Under this transformative order, Medicare will be required to purchase drugs at the same price as other countries pay. So we would pay four or five times more for a drug, we now pay … If somebody else pays $1 and we pay $5, we’re paying $1. Now what’s going to happen is their number will go up, our number will come very substantially down and we’ll all agree at two and a half or two or whatever the final number is. But if some country is paying wherever it may be in the world because they had a better negotiator, because they had smarter people that we have, and that’s what it’s all about. Maybe more honest people. Who knows? Could be a lot of things going, but we get now the lowest price anywhere in the world and no more will we have to suffer by saying, “Gee, why is it so much cheaper for the exact same drug in some other country?” We will determine what other medically advanced nations pay for the most expensive drugs. And instead of paying the highest price, Medicare will pay the lowest price and so will lots of other US buyers.
Medicare is the largest purchase of drugs anywhere in the world by far. Medicare, largest purchaser of drugs in the world, and we’re finally going to use that incredible power to achieve a fairer and lower price for everyone. Everyone will get a fairer and much lower price. This is not talking about one half of a percent. This is big stuff. Under our ridiculous system, which has been broken for decades, we aren’t even allowed to negotiate the price of drugs. Can you believe it? I said, “When are we going to negotiate?” We’re not allowed. We’re restricted by Congress from negotiating the price of drugs. Can you imagine? You say, “I want to get a better price. Oh I’m sorry, sir. You’re not allowed to do that. That’s illegal.” What kind of a system is that? Do you think the world looks at us and said, “Where the hell did these people come from?” But they treat us very nicely. It’s going to end, okay? I see you’re a fan of what we’re saying. You must be a doctor. Are you a doctor? Yeah. Doctors know. The doctors know. You’ve known that for years. We’re not allowed to negotiate. Can you believe it? We just have to take whatever it is.
I’m pleased to announce that as a result of the orders I’m signing today, the heads of the major drug companies have requested a meeting to discuss how we can quickly and significantly lower drug prices and out of pocket expenses for Americans. They want to do what’s right. Look, they’re going to do what’s right. Look, I think it’s so important what they’re doing on therapeutics and vaccines, and we’re going to see them on Tuesday. We’ll see if we can do something here, but this could have been done a long time ago. The drug company executives will be at the White House on Tuesday, and they have some ideas how to significantly reduce drug prices. We’ve already given them to you. I don’t know if they can possibly do something to substitute for what’s called favored nations. Favored nations, that means we get the lowest price anywhere in the world. Whoever gets the best price, congratulations. Thank you very much for being a good negotiator because we now get the lowest price too. Should have been done a long time ago.
If these talks that are successful, we may not need to implement the fourth executive order, which is a very tough order for them. Very tough, and I understand that, and we have a lot of respect for our great pharmaceutical companies, drug companies. We have a lot of respect for them, so we’ll see what they have to say on Tuesday. Maybe they have an idea that’s good, but it’s got to be very substantial. They’re actually in favor of the rebate rule, of the roll back because they say that’s people getting money that aren’t even doing anything for it and bigger money than they’re getting I believe. If they are not, the order will be implemented. If we don’t do a deal or agree to something, the order, number four, favored nations, a big order. They’re all big, all four are very big, by the way, very big. But the fourth order, we’re going to hold that until August 24th, hoping that the pharmaceutical companies will come up with something that will substantially reduce drug prices, and the clock starts right now. So it’s August 24th at 12:00 o’clock, after which the order on favored nations will go into effect and Mark I’ll hold you to it please. 12:00 o’clock not 12:01 right?
In the meantime, we’re working very hard on therapeutics and a vaccine for the China virus, which remains our top priority and which are coming along at record speed. Thank you very much Dr. Hahn, been fantastic. You really have been fantastic. Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month, right? Two. And several more vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks. I did speak to one just recently. They’re working on therapeutics as opposed to vaccine and frankly, that’s the most exciting to me. We can walk into a hospital right now and get people better. I like that even more, but the vaccine long-term will be great.
So we have them both going. They’re both going rapidly and they’re both going very well and I guess the early indications are beyond happy, right? It’s beyond happy. We’re mass producing all of the most promising candidates already so that on day one … That means that we think we have the answer. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be making that bet. It’s a big bet. So that in day one, the day we get it approved, it will be available immediately. Doctor, is that correct? So if we get it approved … Now, normally this process would take to get up to where we are now three years, four years. I’ve heard numbers like that, and we did it in literally a matter of weeks. It’s a really incredible thing.
One of the other things, I was talking about drugs in the pipeline for getting drugs approved, and it does cost billions of dollars, and it would be 12 years, 15 years. And under Dr. Hahn and Scott, before you worked very hard, Scott Gottlieb, we’ve got that down to a number that’s less than half and we’re going down further. We have to make sure it’s safe and right to try came out of this whole thing where we have a drug that we think is good. Matt Gates helped with this and getting it approved and Mark, when he was a Congressman, but we had great help from certain people, but right to try is incredible. We have a drug that works, but it’s got to go through this very long and very detailed process for purposes of safety and to make sure it’s good.
If somebody is terminally ill, very sick, person not going to make it, person very sick, we passed legislation which they’ve been trying to get for 42 years. It’s called right to try where people sign a document that if it doesn’t work out, they’re not suing the drug company, they’re not suing the insurance company and they’re not suing our country. And instead of traveling, if they have money, they travel to Asia and they travel to Europe. They travel all over the world in the hopes of finding a cure, they’re terminally ill. If they have no money, sadly they go home with no hope and they die. We have now a program, right to try, finally happened after, I guess as long as you’ve been a doctor, long before you became a doctor, right? They’ve been trying to get this, but we have a program where they can try these really promising medicines and you have no idea how successful this has already been. It’s incredible.
And one of the things that really came out of it was the biggest problem for the drug companies. They didn’t want it because they didn’t want it in their sample. Because people that are that sick, they don’t want in the sample. And so we created a separate sample so it doesn’t hurt them. But one of the things that’s come out of it is if it works, what is a better testing formula than that? Some-
What is a better testing formula than that, somebody that’s terminally ill and all of a sudden makes it? We’re having examples of that. It’s been incredible. It’s been an incredible program. I hope somebody’s going to be able to write a story about it because it’s been one of the things that I’m very proud of it. I love the name even. They have the right to try a drug that’s not going to be available for two years or three years, the terminally ill. Before, you’d say, “Well, the terminally ill. Yeah, but we don’t want to give them a drug that’s going to hurt them.” Well, they going to die. They didn’t want to give them a drug because they thought it might be dangerous. Perhaps, in some cases, it may be dangerous, but we’re having tremendous success with that program. I’m proud of it.
Additionally, my administration has secured 90% of the world’s supply of the drug, remdesivir, which is having great impact, for the United States and research continues daily on a lot of promising treatments as I said. As we take these historic actions, we’re joined today by Americans who have already benefited from the steps my administration has already taken to reduce the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. We’re going to have a big healthcare bill that we’re going to be putting up very shortly, and it’s going to be very complete.
Today, what we’re doing on prescription drugs… Again, we’ll have to see what happens on August 25th. We’ll either do the favored nations or not depending on the drug companies, but what we’re putting up in a very short period of time on healthcare will be incredible. We have another one coming on immigration, tremendous bill on immigration. It’ll be, I think, something that nobody thought we would be able to get, so that’ll be great. Paul Madden is a senior citizen who relies on insulin every day. He was paying a fortune, everything, to get it. Paul, if you could… I think Paul’s in the audience. If you could please come up and say a few words about your experience. Thank you, Paul. Thank you very much.
That’s better.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Paul. That’s great. I want to thank Seema Verma. You worked so hard on that one. Seema, could you just say something about that? It was the price. Would you come up just for a second, Seema Verma, and just tell them about what we’ve done with respect to very badly-needed insulin.
Thank you very much. Great job. That’s a great job. That you. That’s a tremendous difference. Andrea, please come up and say a few words. Thank you. Please.
Thank you very much.
What did this start at? It’s 700. What did they start-
That’s really nice. I appreciate it. Some big difference. That’s not a 1% or 2%. That’s big dollars. I want to thank you both very much. Thank you very much. Today’s actions continue my administration’s relentless drive to deliver better healthcare at a lower cost. I signed an executive order to fight kidney disease. That was such a big thing. That was such a beautiful, important thing to do with more transplants and better treatment. People with kidney disease go through hell. They go through hell. Their life is hell. We’ve done a lot, and we’re very proud of it. We’ve really seen some results that are incredible.
We dramatically expanded the telehealth for all American patients and families in telehealth in this pandemic era have been, it’s increased by, I would say, it was like 1,020%. Incredible. It’s been up at a level that nobody’s ever imagined, and it actually is very good. It’s been something that has come out of the pandemic. One of the only good things that came out of it, frankly, is people are realizing how good that is. It really worked out well.
We strongly defended Medicare and Social Security, and we’ll always protect and we have been protecting and we’ll always will protect Republicans, totally protect preexisting conditions. Very important. Nothing’s going to happen to your preexisting protections. We ended the gag clause that prevented pharmaceuticals and pharmacists from telling patients how to buy less expensive drugs. We had a clause that if you went up to a pharmacist… Is this the correct statement to-
… and it’s not even believable. You couldn’t talk about price. If the man or woman behind the counter started talking about price, what happens? You take the license away? This is not even believable. Think of that. It prevented pharmacists from telling patients how to buy less expensive drugs. “We have a less expensive drug that’s just as good. I can’t talk about it.” They can’t even say that. I wonder why? Can you imagine these things? We approved a record number of affordable low-cost generics. We’ve increased generics more than any administration by many times, and many of the generics, I would say from what I’m hearing, all of the generic, sometimes people want to see a label, but they say they’re just as good-
… people want to see a label. But they say they’re just as good as the others except you pay a lot less money. We’ve increased them more than any administration, not even close. And we capped insulin costs that we just discussed for many Medicare recipients, and for a lot of other people at just $35 a month, and it was many times that, as you’ve just heard. Right To Try, I talked about. So proud of it. Nothing matters more to me than the health and wellbeing of the American people. There’s nothing more important to me. With today’s actions, we’re ending decades of sellouts, betrayals, and broken promises from Washington. You’ve had a lot of broken promises. I would say exclusively, broken. You’ve had it. It’s been uniformed, broken promises. We’re putting patients over lobbyists, senior citizens before special interests, and we’re putting America first. I’m putting America first.
When you look at what we’re doing with Favored Nations on the basis that it kicks in on August 25th. We’ll see. Let’s see what they have to offer. But when you think about it, what are we doing? We’re putting America first. When you hear other countries getting a much better deal on drug prices, there are people that have told me this is more important than healthcare. We’re doing healthcare, but this is more important than anything, the price of drugs. They were getting slaughtered, slaughtered by drug prices. So thank you very much. I want to thank you all for being here. I’d like to ask, if I could, Alex to come up, please, Secretary Azar, to say a few words, and then I’ll sign an Executive Order.
I’d also like to ask the Governor of Florida. Ron, you’re going to come up and say a few words and we’ll sign up and you’ll go out and buy those drugs and save 50 or 60% for the people of Florida? And other people will be joining you. And that’s great. I want to let you. You will tell me how you do and I’d work on it really fast because now with all of the media back here, you’re under extraordinary pressure, and you never have pressure. One thing I’ll tell you about Ron, Matt will tell you, he handles pressure well. And you’re doing a great job. Thank you very much. Please. Alex.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Alex. Please, Ron, please.
Thank you very much, Ron. Thank you. Thank you. So we’re going to sign four very important documents. I just want to thank Amy. And congratulations, Amy, to you. That elevation is a big one. And you’re going to do fantastically. Russell, congratulations. He just got confirmed and we appreciate it. Fantastic job. And Pat, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. Okay, let’s go. Thank you, all. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Number two, Increase In Drug Importation. That’s great. Let Ron have that. Where’s Ron?
Come on, Ron. Get up here, Ron. It’s yours because that’s what you have to do, right? Importation. Lowering Prices For Patients By Eliminating Kickbacks.
This will go into effect on August 25th if we don’t make a deal, right? Favored Nations. Thank you all very much.
Thank you again, Matt. Thank you, all.
You got a good deal, huh? Thank you all very much.
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
Good luck.
",Donald Trump Speech Transcript July 24: Signs Executive Orders to Lower Prescription Drug Prices,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-july-24-signs-executive-orders-to-lower-prescription-drug-prices
James K. Polk,United States of America,1847-12-07 00:00:00,"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
The annual meeting of Congress is always an interesting event. The representatives of the States and of the people come fresh from their constituents to take counsel together for the common good.
After an existence of near three-fourths of a century as a free and independent Republic, the problem no longer remains to be solved whether man is capable of self-government. The success of our admirable system is a conclusive refutation of the theories of those in other countries who maintain that a ""favored few"" are born to rule and that the mass of mankind must be governed by force. Subject to no arbitrary or hereditary authority, the people are the only sovereigns recognized by our Constitution.
Numerous emigrants, of every lineage and language, attracted by the civil and religious freedom we enjoy and by our happy condition, annually crowd to our shores, and transfer their heart, not less than their allegiance, to the country whose dominion belongs alone to the people. No country has been so much favored, or should acknowledge with deeper reverence the manifestations of the divine protection. An all wise Creator directed and guarded us in our infant struggle for freedom and has constantly watched over our surprising progress until we have become one of the great nations of the earth.
It is in a country thus favored, and under a Government in which the executive and legislative branches hold their authority for limited periods alike from the people, and where all are responsible to their respective constituencies, that it is again my duty to communicate with Congress upon the state of the Union and the present condition of public affairs.
During the past year the most gratifying proofs are presented that our country has been blessed with a widespread and universal prosperity. There has been no period since the Government was founded when all the industrial pursuits of our people have been more successful or when labor in all branches of business has received a fairer or better reward. From our abundance we have been enabled to perform the pleasing duty of furnishing food for the starving millions of less favored countries.
In the enjoyment of the bounties of Providence at home such as have rarely fallen to the lot of any people, it is cause of congratulation that our intercourse with all the powers of the earth except Mexico continues to be of an amicable character.
It has ever been our cherished policy to cultivate peace and good will with all nations, and this policy has been steadily pursued by me. No change has taken place in our relations with Mexico since the adjournment of the last Congress. The war in which the United States were forced to engage with the Government of that country still continues.
I deem it unnecessary, after the full exposition of them contained in my message of the 11th of May, 1846, and in my annual message at the commencement of the session of Congress in December last, to reiterate the serious causes of complaint which we had against Mexico before she commenced hostilities.
It is sufficient on the present occasion to say that the wanton violation of the rights of person and property of our citizens committed by Mexico, her repeated acts of bad faith through a long series of years, and her disregard of solemn treaties stipulating for indemnity to our injured citizens not only constituted ample cause of war on our part, but were of such an aggravated character as would have justified us before the whole world in resorting to this extreme remedy. With an anxious desire to avoid a rupture between the two countries, we forbore for years to assert our clear rights by force, and continued to seek redress for the wrongs we had suffered by amicable negotiation in the hope that Mexico might yield to pacific counsels and the demands of justice. In this hope we were disappointed. Our minister of peace sent to Mexico was insultingly rejected. The Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly unjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war by invading the territory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil.
Though the United States were the aggrieved nation, Mexico commenced the war, and we were compelled in self-defense to repel the invader and to vindicate the national honor and interests by prosecuting it with vigor until we could obtain a just and honorable peace. On learning that hostilities had been commenced by Mexico I promptly communicated that fact, accompanied with a succinct statement of our other causes of complaint against Mexico, to Congress, and that body, by the act of the 13th of May, 1846, declared that ""by the act of the Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between that Government and the United States."" This act declaring ""the war to exist by the act of the Republic of Mexico,"" and making provision for its prosecution ""to a speedy and successful termination,"" was passed with great unanimity by Congress, there being but two negative votes in the Senate and but fourteen in the House of Representatives.
The existence of the war having thus been declared by Congress, it became my duty under the Constitution and the laws to conduct and prosecute it. This duty has been performed, and though at every stage of its progress I have manifested a willingness to terminate it by a just peace, Mexico has refused to accede to any terms which could be accepted by the United States consistently with the national honor and interest.
The rapid and brilliant successes of our arms and the vast extent of the enemy's territory which had been overrun and conquered before the close of the last session of Congress were fully known to that body. Since that time the war has been prosecuted with increased energy, and, I am gratified to state, with a success which commands universal admiration.. History presents no parallel of so many glorious victories achieved by any nation within so short a period. Our Army, regulars and volunteers, have covered themselves with imperishable honors. Whenever and wherever our forces have encountered the enemy, though he was in vastly superior numbers and often intrenched in fortified positions of his own selection and of great strength, he has been defeated. Too much praise can not be bestowed upon our officers and men, regulars and volunteers, for their gallantry, discipline, indomitable courage, and perseverance, all seeking the post of danger and vying with each other in deeds of noble daring.
While every patriot's heart must exult and a just national pride animate every bosom in beholding the high proofs of courage, consummate military skill, steady discipline, and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibited by our gallant Army, the nation is called to mourn over the loss of many brave officers and soldiers, who have fallen in defense of their country's honor and interests. The brave dead met their melancholy fate in a foreign land, nobly discharging their duty, and with their country's flag waving triumphantly in the face of the foe. Their patriotic deeds are justly appreciated, and will long be remembered by their grateful countrymen. The parental care of the Government they loved and served should be extended to their surviving families.
Shortly after the adjournment of the last session of Congress the gratifying intelligence was received of the signal victory of Buena Vista, and of the fall of the city of Vera Cruz, and with it the strong castle of San Juan de Ulloa, by which it was defended. Believing that after these and other successes so honorable to our arms and so disastrous to Mexico the period was propitious to afford her another opportunity, if she thought proper to embrace it, to enter into negotiations for peace, a commissioner was appointed to proceed to the headquarters of our Army with full powers to enter upon negotiations and to conclude a just and honorable treaty of peace. He was not directed to make any new overtures of peace, but was the bearer of a dispatch from the Secretary of State of the United States to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, in reply to one received from the latter of the 22d of February, 1847, in which the Mexican Government was informed of his appointment and of his presence at the headquarters of our Army, and that he was invested with full powers to conclude a definitive treaty of peace whenever the Mexican Government might signify a desire to do so. While I was unwilling to subject the United States to another indignant refusal, I was yet resolved that the evils of the war should not be protracted a day longer than might be rendered absolutely necessary by the Mexican Government.
Care was taken to give no instructions to the commissioner which could in any way interfere with our military operations or relax our energies in the prosecution of the war. He possessed no authority in any manner to control these operations. He was authorized to exhibit his instructions to the general in command of the Army, and in the event of a treaty being concluded and ratified on the part of Mexico he was directed to give him notice of that fact. On the happening of such contingency, and on receiving notice thereof, the general in command was instructed by the Secretary of War to suspend further active military operations until further orders. These instructions were given with a view to intermit hostilities until the treaty thus ratified by Mexico could be transmitted to Washington and receive the action of the Government of the United States. The commissioner was also directed on reaching the Army to deliver to the general in command the dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, and on receiving it the general was instructed by the Secretary of War to cause it to be transmitted to the commander of the Mexican forces, with a quest that it might be communicated to his Government. The commissioner did not reach the headquarters of the Army until after another brilliant victory had crowned our arms at Cerro Gordo. The dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of War to the general in command of the Army was received by that officer, then at Jalapa, on the 7th of May, 1847, together with the dispatch from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, having been transmitted to him from Vera Cruz. The commissioner arrived at the headquarters of the Army a few days afterwards. His presence with the Army and his diplomatic character were made known to the Mexican Government from Puebla on the 12th of June, 1847, by the transmission of the dispatch from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico.
Many weeks elapsed after its receipt, and no overtures were made nor was any desire expressed by the Mexican Government to enter into negotiations for peace.
Our Army pursued its march upon the capital, and as it approached it was met by formidable resistance. Our forces first encountered the enemy, and achieved signal victories in the severely contested battles of Contreras and Churubusco. It was not until after these actions had resulted in decisive victories and the capital of the enemy was within our power that the Mexican Government manifested any disposition to enter into negotiations for peace, and even then, as events have proved, there is too much reason to believe they were insincere, and that in agreeing to go through the forms of negotiation the object was to gain time to strengthen the defenses of their capital and to prepare for fresh resistance.
The general in command of the Army deemed it expedient to suspend hostilities temporarily by entering into an armistice with a view to the opening of negotiations. Commissioners were appointed on the part of Mexico to meet the commissioner on the part of the United States. The result of the conferences which took place between these functionaries of the two Governments was a failure to conclude a treaty of peace. The commissioner of the United States took with him the project of a treaty already prepared, by the terms of which the indemnity required by the United States was a cession of territory.
It is well known that the only indemnity which it is in the power of Mexico to make in satisfaction of the just and long-deferred claims of our citizens against her and the only means by which she can reimburse the United States for the expenses of the war is a cession to the United States of a portion of her territory. Mexico has no money to pay, and no other means of making the required indemnity. If we refuse this, we can obtain nothing else. To reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of territory would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object.
A state of war abrogates treaties previously existing between the belligerents and a treaty of peace puts an end to all claims for indemnity for tortious acts committed under the authority of one government against the citizens or subjects of another unless they are provided for in its stipulations. A treaty of peace which would terminate the existing war without providing for indemnity would enable Mexico, the acknowledged debtor and herself the aggressor in the war, to relieve herself from her just liabilities. By such a treaty our citizens who hold just demands against her would have no remedy either against Mexico or their own Government. Our duty to these citizens must forever prevent such a peace, and no treaty which does not provide ample means of discharging these demands can receive my sanction.
A treaty of peace should settle all existing differences between the two countries. If an adequate cession of territory should be made by such a treaty, the United States should release Mexico from all her liabilities and assume their payment to our own citizens. If instead of this the United States were to consent to a treaty by which Mexico should again engage to pay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to our Government and our citizens would impose on her, it is notorious that she does not possess the means to meet such an undertaking. From such a treaty no result could be anticipated but the same irritating disappointments which have heretofore attended the violations of similar treaty stipulations on the part of Mexico. Such a treaty would be but a temporary cessation of hostilities, without the restoration of the friendship and good understanding which should characterize the future intercourse between the two countries.
That Congress contemplated the acquisition of territorial indemnity when that body made provision for the prosecution of the war is obvious. Congress could not have meant when, in May, 1846, they appropriated $10,000,000 and authorized the President to employ the militia and naval and military forces of the United States and to accept the services of 50,000 volunteers to enable him to prosecute the war, and when, at their last session, and after our Army had invaded Mexico, they made additional appropriations and authorized the raising of additional troops for the same purpose, that no indemnity was to be obtained from Mexico at the conclusion of the war; and yet it was certain that if no Mexican territory was acquired no indemnity could be obtained. It is further manifest that Congress contemplated territorial indemnity from the fact that at their last session an act was passed, upon the Executive recommendation, appropriating $3,000,000 with that express object. This appropriation was made ""to enable the President to conclude a treaty of peace, limits, and boundaries with the Republic of Mexico, to be used by him in the event that said treaty, when signed by the authorized agents of the two Governments and duly ratified by Mexico, shall call for the expenditure of the same or any part thereof."" The object of asking this appropriation was distinctly stated in the several messages on the subject which I communicated to Congress. Similar appropriations made in 1803 and 1806, which were referred to, were intended to be applied in part consideration for the cession of Louisiana and the Floridas. In like manner it was anticipated that in settling the terms of a treaty of ""limits and boundaries"" with Mexico a cession of territory estimated to be of greater value than the amount of our demands against her might be obtained, and that the prompt payment of this sum in part consideration for the territory ceded, on the conclusion of a treaty and its ratification on her part, might be an inducement with her to make such a cession of territory as would be satisfactory to the United States; and although the failure to conclude such a treaty has rendered it unnecessary to use any part of the $3,000,000 appropriated by that act, and the entire sum remains in the Treasury, it is still applicable to that object should the contingency occur making such application proper.
The doctrine of no territory is the doctrine of no indemnity, and if sanctioned would be a public acknowledgment that our country was wrong and that the war declared by Congress with extraordinary unanimity was unjust and should be abandoned--an admission unfounded in fact and degrading to the national character.
The terms of the treaty proposed by the United States were not only just to Mexico, but, considering the character and amount of our claims, the unjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostilities by her, the expenses of the war to which we have been subjected, and the success which had attended our arms, were deemed to be of a most liberal character.
The commissioner of the United States was authorized to agree to the establishment of the Rio Grande as the boundary from its entrance into the Gulf to its intersection with the southern boundary of New Mexico, in north latitude about 32 degree, and to obtain a cession to the United States of the Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias and the privilege of the right of way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The boundary of the Rio Grande and the cession to the United States of New Mexico and Upper California constituted an ultimatum which our commissioner was under no circumstances to yield.
That it might be manifest, not only to Mexico, but to all other nations, that the United States were not disposed to take advantage of a feeble power by insisting upon wrestling from her all the other Provinces, including many of her principal towns and cities, which we had conquered and held in our military occupation but were willing to conclude a treaty in a spirit of liberality, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the restoration to Mexico of all our other conquests.
As the territory to be acquired by the boundary proposed might be estimated to be of greater value than a fair equivalent for our just demands, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the payment of such additional pecuniary consideration as was deemed reasonable.
The terms of a treaty proposed by the Mexican commissioners were wholly inadmissible. They negotiated as if Mexico were the victorious, and not the vanquished, party. They must have known that their ultimatum could never be accepted. It required the United States to dismember Texas by surrendering to Mexico that part of the territory of that State lying between the Nueces and the Rio Grande, included within her limits by her laws when she was an independent republic, and when she was annexed to the United States and admitted by Congress as one of the States of our Union. It contained no provision for the payment by Mexico of the just claims of our citizens. It required indemnity to Mexican citizens for injuries they may have sustained by our troops in the prosecution of the war. It demanded the right for Mexico to levy and collect the Mexican tariff of duties on goods imported into her ports while in our military occupation during the war, and the owners of which had paid to officers of the United States the military contributions which had been levied upon them; and it offered to cede to the United States, for a pecuniary consideration, that part of Upper California lying north of latitude 37&deg;. Such were the unreasonable terms proposed by the Mexican commissioners.
The cession to the United States by Mexico of the Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias, as proposed by the commissioner of the United States, it was believed would be more in accordance with the convenience and interests of both nations than any other cession of territory which it was probable Mexico could be induced to make.
It is manifest to all who have observed the actual condition of the Mexican Government for some years past and at present that if these Provinces should be retained by her she could not long continue to hold and govern them. Mexico is too feeble a power to govern these Provinces, lying as they do at a distance of more than 1,000 miles from her capital, and if attempted to be retained by her they would constitute but for a short time even nominally a part of her dominions. This would be especially the case with Upper California.
The sagacity of powerful European nations has long since directed their attention to the commercial importance of that Province, and there can be little doubt that the moment the United States shall relinquish their present occupation of it and their claim to it as indemnity an effort would be made by some foreign power to possess it, either by conquest or by purchase. If no foreign government should acquire it in either of these modes, an independent revolutionary government would probably be established by the inhabitants and such foreigners as may remain in or remove to the country as soon as it shall be known that the United States have abandoned it. Such a government would be too feeble long to maintain its separate independent existence, and would finally become annexed to or be a dependent colony of some more powerful state. Should any foreign government attempt to possess it as a colony, or otherwise to incorporate it with itself, the principle avowed by President Monroe in 1824, and reaffirmed in my first annual message, that no foreign power shall with our consent be permitted to plant or establish any new colony or dominion on any part of the North American continent must be maintained. In maintaining this principle and in resisting its invasion by any foreign power we might be involved in other wars more expensive and more difficult than that in which we are now engaged. The Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias are contiguous to the territories of the United States, and if brought under the government of our laws their resources--mineral, agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial--would soon be developed.
Upper California is bounded on the north by our Oregon possessions, and if held by the United States would soon be settled by a hardy, enterprising, and intelligent portion of our population. The Bay of San Francisco and other harbors along the Californian coast would afford shelter for our Navy, for our numerous whale ships, and other merchant vessels employed in the Pacific Ocean, and would in a short period become the marts of an extensive and profitable commerce with China and other countries of the East.
These advantages, in which the whole commercial world would participate, would at once be secured to the United States by the cession of this territory; while it is certain that as long as it remains a part of the Mexican dominions they can be enjoyed neither by Mexico herself nor by any other nation.
New Mexico is a frontier Province, and has never been of any considerable value to Mexico. From its locality it is naturally connected with our Western settlements. The territorial limits of the State of Texas, too, as defined by her laws before her admission into our Union, embrace all that portion of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande, while Mexico still claims to hold this territory as a part of her dominions. The adjustment of this question of boundary is important.
There is another consideration which induced the belief that the Mexican Government might even desire to place this Province under the protection of the Government of the United States. Numerous bands of fierce and warlike savages wander over it and upon its borders. Mexico has been and must continue to be too feeble to restrain them from committing depredations, robberies, and murders, not only upon the inhabitants of New Mexico itself, but upon those of the other northern States of Mexico. It would be a blessing to all these northern States to have their citizens protected against them by the power of the United States. At this moment many Mexicans, principally females and children, are in captivity among them. If New Mexico were held and governed by the United States, we could effectually prevent these tribes from committing such outrages, and compel them to release these captives and restore them to their families and friends.
In proposing to acquire New Mexico and the Californias, it was known that but an inconsiderable portion of the Mexican people would be transferred with them, the country embraced within these Provinces being chiefly an uninhabited region.
These were the leading considerations which induced me to authorize the terms of peace which were proposed to Mexico. They were rejected, and, negotiations being at an end, hostilities were renewed. An assault was made by our gallant Army upon the strongly fortified places near the gates of the City of Mexico and upon the city itself, and after several days of severe conflict the Mexican forces, vastly superior in number to our own, were driven from the city, and it was occupied by our troops.
Immediately after information was received of the unfavorable result of the negotiations, believing that his continued presence with the Army could be productive of no good, I determined to recall our commissioner. A dispatch to this effect was transmitted to him on the 6th of October last. The Mexican Government will be informed of his recall, and that in the existing state of things I shall not deem it proper to make any further overtures of peace, but shall be at all times ready to receive and consider any proposals which may be made by Mexico.
Since the liberal proposition of the United States was authorized to be made, in April last, large expenditures have been incurred and the precious blood of many of our patriotic fellow-citizens has been shed in the prosecution of the war. This consideration and the obstinate perseverance of Mexico in protracting the war must influence the terms of peace which it may be deemed proper hereafter to accept. Our arms having been everywhere victorious, having subjected to our military occupation a large portion of the enemy's country, including his capital, and negotiations for peace having failed, the important questions arise, in what manner the war ought to be prosecuted and what should be our future policy. I can not doubt that we should secure and render available the conquests which we have already made, and that with this view we should hold and occupy by our naval and military forces all the ports, towns, cities, and Provinces now in our occupation or which may hereafter fall into our possession; that we should press forward our military operations and levy such military contributions on the enemy as may, as far as practicable, defray the future expenses of the war.
Had the Government of Mexico acceded to the equitable and liberal terms proposed, that mode of adjustment would have been preferred, Mexico having declined to do this and failed to offer any other terms which could be accepted by the United States, the national honor, no less than the public interests, requires that the war should be prosecuted with increased energy and power until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtained. In the meantime, as Mexico refuses all indemnity, we should adopt measures to indemnify ourselves by appropriating permanently a portion of her territory. Early after the commencement of the war New Mexico and the Californias were taken possession of by our forces. Our military and naval commanders were ordered to conquer and hold them, subject to be disposed of by a treaty of peace.
These Provinces are now in our undisputed occupation, and have been so for many months, all resistance on the part of Mexico having ceased within their limits. I am satisfied that they should never be surrendered to Mexico. Should Congress concur with me in this opinion, and that they should be retained by the United States as indemnity, I can perceive no good reason why the civil jurisdiction and laws of the United States should not at once be extended over them. To wait for a treaty of peace such as we are willing to make, by which our relations toward them would not be changed, can not be good policy; whilst our own interest and that of the people inhabiting them require that a stable, responsible, and free government under our authority should as soon as possible be established over them. Should Congress, therefore, determine to hold these Provinces permanently, and that they shall hereafter be considered as constituent parts of our country, the early establishment of Territorial governments over them will be important for the more perfect protection of persons and property; and I recommend that such Territorial governments be established. It will promote peace and tranquillity among the inhabitants, by allaying all apprehension that they may still entertain of being again subjected to the jurisdiction of Mexico. I invite the early and favorable consideration of Congress to this important subject.
Besides New Mexico and the Californias, there are other Mexican Provinces which have been reduced to our possession by conquest. These other Mexican Provinces are now governed by our military and naval commanders under the general authority which is conferred upon a conqueror by the laws of war. They should continue to be held, as a means of coercing Mexico to accede to just terms of peace. Civil as well as military officers are required to conduct such a government. Adequate compensation, to be drawn from contributions levied on the enemy, should be fixed by law for such officers as may be thus employed. What further provision may become necessary and what final disposition it may be proper to make of them must depend on the future progress of the war and the course which Mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue.
With the views I entertain I can not favor the policy which has been suggested, either to withdraw our Army altogether or to retire to a designated line and simply hold and defend it. To withdraw our Army altogether from the conquests they have made by deeds of unparalleled bravery, and at the expense of so much blood and treasure, in a just war on our part, and one which, by the act of the enemy, we could not honorably have avoided, would be to degrade the nation in its own estimation and in that of the world. To retire to a line and simply hold and defend it would not terminate the war. On the contrary, it would encourage Mexico to persevere and tend to protract it indefinitely. It is not to be expected that Mexico, after refusing to establish such a line as a permanent boundary when our victorious Army are in possession of her capital and in the heart of her country, would permit us to hold it without resistance. That she would continue the war, and in the most harassing and annoying forms, there can be no doubt. A border warfare of the most savage character, extending over a long line, would be unceasingly waged. It would require a large army to be kept constantly in the field, stationed at posts and garrisons along such a line, to protect and defend it. The enemy, relieved from the pressure of our arms on his coasts and in the populous parts of the interior, would direct his attention to this line, and, selecting an isolated post for attack, would concentrate his forces upon it. This would be a condition of affairs which the Mexicans, pursuing their favorite system of guerrilla warfare, would probably prefer to any other. Were we to assume a defensive attitude on such a line, all the advantages of such a state of war would be on the side of the enemy. We could levy no contributions upon him, or in any other way make him feel the pressure of the war, but must remain inactive and await his approach, being in constant uncertainty at what point on the line or at what time he might make an assault. He may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the interior on his own side of the line, and, concealing his purpose, make a sudden assault upon some one of our posts so distant from any other as to prevent the possibility of timely succor or reenforcements, and in this way our gallant Army would be exposed to the danger of being cut off in detail; or if by their unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere exhibited during this war they should repulse the enemy, their numbers stationed at any one post may be too small to pursue him. If the enemy be repulsed in one attack, he would have nothing to do but to retreat to his own side of the line, and, being in no fear of a pursuing army, may reenforce himself at leisure for another attack on the same or some other post. He may, too, cross the line between our posts, make rapid incursions into the country which we hold, murder the inhabitants, commit depredations on them, and then retreat to the interior before a sufficient force can be concentrated to pursue him. Such would probably be the harassing character of a mere defensive war on our part. If our forces when attacked, or threatened with attack, be permitted to cross the line, drive back the enemy, and conquer him, this would be again to invade the enemy's country after having lost all the advantages of the conquests we have already made by having voluntarily abandoned them. To hold such a line successfully and in security it is far from being certain that it would not require as large an army as would be necessary to hold all the conquests we have already made and to continue the prosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy's country. It is also far from being certain that the expenses of the war would be diminished by such a policy. I am persuaded that the best means of vindicating the national honor and interest and of bringing the war to an honorable close will be to prosecute it with increased energy and power in the vital parts of the enemy's country.
In my annual message to Congress of December last I declared that-- The war has not been waged with a view to conquest, but, having been commenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy's country and will be vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable peace, and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war, as well as to our much-injured citizens, who hold large pecuniary demands against Mexico.
Such, in my judgment, continues to be our true policy; indeed, the only policy which will probably secure a permanent peace.
It has never been contemplated by me, as an object of the war, to make a permanent conquest of the Republic of Mexico or to annihilate her separate existence as an independent nation. On the contrary, it has ever been my desire that she should maintain her nationality, and under a good government adapted to her condition be a free, independent, and prosperous Republic. The United States were the first among the nations to recognize her independence, and have always desired to be on terms of amity and good neighborhood with her. This she would not suffer. By her own conduct we have been compelled to engage in the present war. In its prosecution we seek not her overthrow as a nation, but in vindicating our national honor we seek to obtain redress for the wrongs she has done us and indemnity for our just demands against her. We demand an honorable peace, and that peace must bring with it indemnity for the past and security for the future. Hitherto Mexico has refused all accommodation by which such a peace could be obtained.
Whilst our armies have advanced from victory to victory from the commencement of the war, it has always been with the olive branch of peace in their hands, and it has been in the power of Mexico at every step to arrest hostilities by accepting it.
One great obstacle to the attainment of peace has undoubtedly arisen from the fact that Mexico has been so long held in subjection by one faction or military usurper after another, and such has been the condition of insecurity in which their successive governments have been placed that each has been deterred from making peace lest for this very cause a rival faction might expel it from power. Such was the fate of President Herrera's administration in 1845 for being disposed even to listen to the overtures of the United States to prevent the war, as is fully confirmed by an official correspondence which took place in the month of August last between him and his Government, a copy of which is herewith communicated. ""For this cause alone the revolution which displaced him from power was set on foot"" by General Paredes. Such may be the condition of insecurity of the present Government.
There can be no doubt that the peaceable and well-disposed inhabitants of Mexico are convinced that it is the true interest of their country to conclude an honorable peace with the United States, but the apprehension of becoming the victims of some military faction or usurper may have prevented them from manifesting their feelings by any public act. The removal of any such apprehension would probably cause them to speak their sentiments freely and to adopt the measures necessary for the restoration of peace. With a people distracted and divided by contending factions and a Government subject to constant changes by successive revolutions, the continued successes of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace. In such event it may become proper for our commanding generals in the field to give encouragement and assurances of protection to the friends of peace in Mexico in the establishment and maintenance of a free republican government of their own choice, able and willing to conclude a peace which would be just to them and secure to us the indemnity we demand. This may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace. Should such be the result, the war which Mexico has forced upon us would thus be converted into an enduring blessing to herself. After finding her torn and distracted by factions, and ruled by military usurpers, we should then leave her with a republican government in the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and prosperity, performing all her relative duties in the great family of nations and promoting her own happiness by wise laws and their faithful execution.
If, after affording this encouragement and protection, and after all the persevering and sincere efforts we have made from the moment Mexico commenced the war, and prior to that time, to adjust our differences with her, we shall ultimately fail, then we shall have exhausted all honorable means in pursuit of peace, and must continue to occupy her country with our troops, taking the full measure of indemnity into our own hands, and must enforce the terms which our honor demands.
To act otherwise in the existing state of things in Mexico, and to withdraw our Army without a peace, would not only leave all the wrongs of which we complain unredressed, but would be the signal for new and fierce civil dissensions and new revolutions--all alike hostile to peaceful relations with the United States. Besides, there is danger, if our troops were withdrawn before a peace was conducted, that the Mexican people, wearied with successive revolutions and deprived of protection for their persons and property, might at length be inclined to yield to foreign influences and to cast themselves into the arms of some European monarch for protection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue. This, for our own safety and in pursuance of our established policy, we should be compelled to resist. We could never consent that Mexico should be thus converted into a monarchy governed by a foreign prince.
Mexico is our near neighbor, and her boundaries are coterminous with our own through the whole extent across the North American continent, from ocean to ocean. Both politically and commercially we have the deepest interest in her regeneration and prosperity. Indeed, it is impossible that, with any just regard to our own safety, we can ever become indifferent to her fate.
It may be that the Mexican Government and people have misconstrued or misunderstood our forbearance and our objects in desiring to conclude an amicable adjustment of the existing differences between the two countries. They may have supposed that we would submit to terms degrading to the nation, or they may have drawn false inferences from the supposed division of opinion in the United States on the subject of the war, and may have calculated to gain much by protracting it, and, indeed, that we might ultimately abandon it altogether without insisting on any indemnity, territorial or otherwise. Whatever may be the false impressions under which they have acted, the adoption and prosecution of the energetic policy proposed must soon undeceive them.
In the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be made to feel its pressure more than they have heretofore done. At its commencement it was deemed proper to conduct it in a spirit of forbearance and liberality. With this end in view, early measures were adopted to conciliate, as far as a state of war would permit, the mass of the Mexican population; to convince them that the war was waged, not against the peaceful inhabitants of Mexico, but against their faithless Government, which had commenced hostilities; to remove from their minds the false impressions which their designing and interested rulers had artfully attempted to make, that the war on our part was one of conquest, that it was a war against their religion and their churches, which were to be desecrated and overthrown, and that their rights of person and private property would be violated. To remove these false impressions, our commanders in the field were directed scrupulously to respect their religion, their churches, and their church property, which were in no manner to be violated; they were directed also to respect the rights of persons and property of all who should not take up arms against us.
Assurances to this effect were given to the Mexican people by Major General Taylor in a proclamation issued in pursuance of instructions from the Secretary of War in the month of June, 1846, and again by Major-General Scott, who acted upon his own convictions of the propriety of issuing it, in a proclamation of the 11th of May, 1847. In this spirit of liberality and conciliation, and with a view to prevent the body of the Mexican population from taking up arms against us, was the war conducted on our part. Provisions and other supplies furnished to our Army by Mexican citizens were paid for at fair and liberal prices, agreed upon by the parties. After the lapse of a few months it became apparent that these assurances and this mild treatment had failed to produce the desired effect upon the Mexican population. While the war had been conducted on our part according to the most humane and liberal principles observed by civilized nations, it was waged in a far different spirit on the part of Mexico. Not appreciating our forbearance, the Mexican people generally became hostile to the United States, and availed themselves of every opportunity to commit the most savage excesses upon our troops. Large numbers of the population took up arms, and, engaging in guerrilla warfare, robbed and murdered in the most cruel manner individual soldiers or small parties whom accident or other causes had separated from the main body of our Army; bands of guerrilleros and robbers infested the roads, harassed our trains, and whenever it was in their power cut off our supplies.
The Mexicans having thus shown themselves to be wholly incapable of appreciating our forbearance and liberality, it was deemed proper to change the manner of conducting the war, by making them feel its pressure according to the usages observed under similar circumstances by all other civilized nations.
Accordingly, as early as the 22d of September, 1846, instructions were given by the Secretary of War to Major-General Taylor to ""draw supplies"" for our Army ""from the enemy without paying for them, and to require contributions for its support, if in that way he was satisfied he could get abundant supplies for his forces."" In directing the execution of these instructions much was necessarily left to the discretion of the commanding officer, who was best acquainted with the circumstances by which he was surrounded, the wants of the Army, and the practicability of enforcing the measure. General Taylor, on the 26th of October, 1846, replied from Monterey that ""it would have been impossible hitherto, and is so now, to sustain the Army to any extent by forced contributions of money or supplies."" For the reasons assigned by him, he did not adopt the policy of his instructions, but declared his readiness to do so ""should the Army in its future operations reach a portion of the country which may be made to supply the troops with advantage."" He continued to pay for the articles of supply which were drawn from the enemy's country.
Similar instructions were issued to Major-General Scott on the 3d of April, 1847, who replied from Jalapa on the 20th of May, 1847, that if it be expected ""that the Army is to support itself by forced contributions levied upon the country we may ruin and exasperate the inhabitants and starve ourselves."" The same discretion was given to him that had been to General Taylor in this respect. General Scott, for the reasons assigned by him, also continued to pay for the articles of supply for the Army which were drawn from the enemy.
After the Army had reached the heart of the most wealthy portion of Mexico it was supposed that the obstacles which had before that time prevented it would not be such as to render impracticable the levy of forced contributions for its support, and on the 1st of September and again on the 6th of October, 1847, the order was repeated in dispatches addressed by the Secretary of War to General Scott, and his attention was again called to the importance of making the enemy bear the burdens of the war by requiring them to furnish the means of supporting our Army, and he was directed to adopt this policy unless by doing so there was danger of depriving the Army of the necessary supplies. Copies of these dispatches were forwarded to General Taylor for his government.
On the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military and naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon all vessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico in our military occupation, and to apply such contributions toward defraying the expenses of the war. By virtue of the right of conquest and the laws of war, the conqueror, consulting his own safety or convenience, may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all such ports or permit it upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe. Before the principal ports of Mexico were blockaded by our Navy the revenue derived from import duties under the laws of Mexico was paid into the Mexican treasury. After these ports had fallen into our military possession the blockade was raised and commerce with them permitted upon prescribed terms and conditions. They were opened to the trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more moderate in their amount than those which had been previously levied by Mexico, and the revenue, which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury, was directed to be collected by our military and naval officers and applied to the use of our Army and Navy. Care was taken that the officers, soldiers, and sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the operations of the order, and, as the merchandise imported upon which the order operated must be consumed by Mexican citizens, the contributions exacted were in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the application of them to our own use. In directing this measure the object was to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the expenses of the war.
For the amount of contributions which have been levied in this form I refer you to the accompanying reports of the Secretary of War and of the Secretary of the Navy, by which it appears that a sum exceeding half a million of dollars has been collected. This amount would undoubtedly have been much larger but for the difficulty of keeping open communications between the coast and the interior, so as to enable the owners of the merchandise imported to transport and vend it to the inhabitants of the country. It is confidently expected that this difficulty will to a great extent be soon removed by our increased forces which have been sent to the field.
Measures have recently been adopted by which the internal as well as the external revenues of Mexico in all places in our military occupation will be seized and appropriated to the use of our Army and Navy.
The policy of levying upon the enemy contributions in every form consistently with the laws of nations, which it may be practicable for our military commanders to adopt, should, in my judgment, be rigidly enforced, and orders to this effect have accordingly been given. By such a policy, at the same time that our own Treasury will be relieved from a heavy drain, the Mexican people will be made to feel the burdens of the war, and, consulting their own interests, may be induced the more readily to require their rulers to accede to a just peace.
After the adjournment of the last session of Congress events transpired in the prosecution of the war which in my judgment required a greater number of troops in the field than had been anticipated. The strength of the Army was accordingly increased by ""accepting"" the services of all the volunteer forces authorized by the act of the 13th of May, 1846, without putting a construction on that act the correctness of which was seriously questioned. The volunteer forces now in the field, with those which had been ""accepted"" to ""serve for twelve months"" and were discharged at the end of their term of service, exhaust the 50,000 men authorized by that act. Had it been clear that a proper construction of the act warranted it, the services of an additional number would have been called for and accepted; but doubts existing upon this point, the power was not exercised. It is deemed important that Congress should at an early period of their session confer the authority to raise an additional regular force to serve during the war with Mexico and to be discharged upon the conclusion and ratification of a treaty of peace. I invite the attention of Congress to the views presented by the Secretary of War in his report upon this subject.
I recommend also that authority be given by law to call for and accept the services of an additional number of volunteers, to be exercised at such time and to such extent as the emergencies of the service may require.
In prosecuting the war with Mexico, whilst the utmost care has been taken to avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral nations, and none has been given, liberal privileges have been granted to their commerce in the ports of the enemy in our military occupation. The difficulty with the Brazilian Government, which at one time threatened to interrupt the friendly relations between the two countries, will, I trust, be speedily adjusted. I have received information that an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United States will shortly be appointed by His Imperial Majesty, and it is hoped that he will come instructed and prepared to adjust all remaining differences between the two Governments in a manner acceptable and honorable to both. In the meantime, I have every reason to believe that nothing will occur to interrupt our amicable relations with Brazil.
It has been my constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most intimate relations of friendship with all the independent powers of South America, and this policy has been attended with the happiest results. It is true that the settlement and payment of many just claims of American citizens against these nations have been long delayed. The peculiar position in which they have been placed and the desire on the part of my predecessors as well as myself to grant them the utmost indulgence have hitherto prevented these claims from being urged in a manner demanded by strict justice. The time has arrived when they ought to be finally adjusted and liquidated, and efforts are now making for that purpose.
It is proper to inform you that the Government of Peru has in good faith paid the first two installments of the indemnity of $30,000 each, and the greater portion of the interest due thereon, in execution of the convention between that Government and the United States the ratifications of which were exchanged at Lima on the 31st of October, 1846. The Attorney-General of the United States early in August last completed the adjudication of the claims under this convention, and made his report thereon in pursuance of the act of the 8th of August, 1846. The sums to which the claimants are respectively entitled will be paid on demand at the Treasury.
I invite the early attention of Congress to the present condition of our citizens in China. Under our treaty with that power American citizens are withdrawn from the jurisdiction, whether civil or criminal, of the Chinese Government and placed under that of our public functionaries in that country. By these alone can our citizens be tried and punished for the commission of any crime; by these alone can questions be decided between them involving the rights of persons and property, and by these alone can contracts be enforced into which they may have entered with the citizens or subjects of foreign powers. The merchant vessels of the United States lying in the waters of the five ports of China open to foreign commerce are under the exclusive jurisdiction of officers of their own Government. Until Congress shall establish competent tribunals to try and punish crimes and to exercise jurisdiction in civil cases in China, American citizens there are subject to no law whatever. Crimes may be committed with impunity and debts may be contracted without any means to enforce their payment. Inconveniences have already resulted from the omission of Congress to legislate upon the subject, and still greater are apprehended. The British authorities in China have already complained that this Government has not provided for the punishment of crimes or the enforcement of contracts against American citizens in that country, whilst their Government has established tribunals by which an American citizen can recover debts due from British subjects. Accustomed, as the Chinese are, to summary justice, they could not be made to comprehend why criminals who are citizens of the United States should escape with impunity, in violation of treaty obligations, whilst the punishment of a Chinese who had committed any crime against an American citizen would be rigorously exacted. Indeed, the consequences might be fatal to American citizens in China should a flagrant crime be committed by any one of them upon a Chinese, and should trial and punishment not follow according to the requisitions of the treaty. This might disturb, if not destroy, our friendly relations with that Empire, and cause an interruption of our valuable commerce. Our treaties with the Sublime Porte, Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco, and Muscat also require the legislation of Congress to carry them into execution, though the necessity for immediate action may not be so urgent as in regard to China.
The Secretary of State has submitted an estimate to defray the expense of opening diplomatic relations with the Papal States. The interesting political events now in progress in these States, as well as a just regard to our commercial interests, have, in my opinion, rendered such a measure highly expedient.
Estimates have also been submitted for the outfits and salaries of charges' d'affaires to the Republics of Bolivia, Guatemala, and Ecuador. The manifest importance of cultivating the most friendly relations with all the independent States upon this continent has induced me to recommend appropriations necessary for the maintenance of these missions.
I recommend to Congress that an appropriation be made to be paid to the Spanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the Amistad case. I entertain the conviction that this is due to Spain under the treaty of the 20th of October, 1795, and, moreover, that from the earnest manner in which the claim continues to be urged so long as it shall remain unsettled it will be a source of irritation and discord between the two countries, which may prove highly prejudicial to the interests of the United States. Good policy, no less than a faithful compliance with our treaty obligations, requires that the inconsiderable appropriation demanded should be made.
A detailed statement of the condition of the finances will be presented in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The imports for the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1847, were of the value of $146,545,638, of which the amount exported was $8,011,158, leaving $138,534,480 in the country for domestic use. The value of the exports for the same period was $158,648,622, of which $150,637,464 consisted of domestic productions and $8,011,158 of foreign articles.
It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1848, including the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last, will amount to $42,886,545.80, of which $31,000,000, it is estimated, will be derived from customs, $3,500,000 from the sale of the public lands, $400,000 from incidental sources, eluding sales made by the Solicitor of the Treasury, and $6,285,294.55 from loans already authorized by law, which, together with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last, make the sum estimated.
Of the loan of twenty-three millions authorized by the act of the 28th of January, 1847, the sum of five millions was paid out to the public creditors or exchanged at par for specie; the remaining eighteen millions was offered for specie to the highest bidder not below par, by an advertisement issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and published from the 9th of February until the 10th of April, 1847, when it was awarded to the several highest bidders at premiums varying from one-eighth of per cent to 2 per cent above par. The premium has been paid into the Treasury and the sums awarded deposited in specie in the Treasury as fast as it was required by the wants of the Government.
The act of the 30th of July, 1846, ""reducing the duties on imports,"" has been in force since the 1st of December last, and I am gratified to state that all the beneficial effects which were anticipated from its operation have been fully realized. The public revenue derived from customs during the year ending on the 1st of December, 1847, exceeds by more than $8,000,000 the amount received in the preceding year under the operation of the act of 1842, which was superseded and repealed by it. Its effects are visible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity which prevails in every branch of business.
While the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duties of the act of 1842 and the substitution in their place of reasonable revenue rates levied on articles imported according to their actual value has increased the revenue and augmented our foreign trade, all the great interests of the country have been advanced and promoted.
The great and important interests of agriculture, which had been not only too much neglected, but actually taxed under the protective policy for the benefit of other interests, have been relieved of the burdens which that policy imposed on them; and our farmers and planters, under a more just and liberal commercial policy, are finding new and profitable markets abroad for their augmented products. Our commerce is rapidly increasing, and is extending more widely the circle of international exchanges. Great as has been the increase of our imports during the past year, our exports of domestic products sold in foreign markets have been still greater.
Our navigating interest is eminently prosperous. The number of vessels built in the United States has been greater than during any preceding period of equal length. Large profits have been derived by those who have constructed as well as by those who have navigated them. Should the ratio of increase in the number of our merchant vessels be progressive, and be as great for the future as during the past year, the time is not distant when our tonnage and commercial marine will be larger than that of any other nation in the world.
Whilst the interests of agriculture, of commerce, and of navigation have been enlarged and invigorated, it is highly gratifying to observe that our manufactures are also in a prosperous condition. None of the ruinous effects upon this interest which were apprehended by some as the result of the operation of the revenue system established by the act of 1846 have been experienced. On the contrary, the number of manufactories and the amount of capital invested in them is steadily and rapidly increasing, affording gratifying proofs that American enterprise and skill employed in this branch of domestic industry, with no other advantages than those fairly and incidentally accruing from a just System of revenue duties, are abundantly able to meet successfully all competition from abroad and still derive fair and remunerating profits. While capital invested in manufactures is yielding adequate and fair profits under the new system, the wages of labor, whether employed in manufactures, agriculture, commerce, or navigation, have been augmented. The toiling millions whose daily labor furnishes the supply of food and raiment and all the necessaries and comforts of life are receiving higher wages and more steady and permanent employment than in any other country or at any previous period of our own history.
So successful have been all branches of our industry that a foreign war, which generally diminishes the resources of a nation, has in no essential degree retarded our onward progress or checked our general prosperity.
With such gratifying evidences of prosperity and of the successful operation of the revenue act of 1846, every consideration of public policy recommends that it shall remain unchanged. It is hoped that the system of impost duties which it established may be regarded as the permanent policy of the country, and that the great interests affected by it may not again be subject to be injuriously disturbed, as they have heretofore been by frequent and sometimes sudden changes.
For the purpose of increasing the revenue, and without changing or modifying the rates imposed by the act of 1846 on the dutiable articles embraced by its provisions, I again recommend to your favorable consideration the expediency of levying a revenue duty on tea and coffee. The policy which exempted these articles from duty during peace, and when the revenue to be derived from them was not needed, ceases to exist when the country is engaged in war and requires the use of all of its available resources. It is a tax which would be so generally diffused among the people that it would be felt oppressively by none and be complained of by none. It is believed that there are not in the list of imported articles any which are more properly the subject of war duties than tea and coffee.
It is estimated that $3,000,000 would be derived annually by a moderate duty imposed on these articles.
Should Congress avail itself of this additional source of revenue, not only would the amount of the public loan rendered necessary by the war with Mexico be diminished to that extent, but the public credit and the public confidence in the ability and determination of the Government to meet all its engagements promptly would be more firmly established, and the reduced amount of the loan which it may be necessary to negotiate could probably be obtained at cheaper rates.
Congress is therefore called upon to determine whether it is wiser to impose the war duties recommended or by omitting to do so increase the public debt annually $3,000,000 so long as loans shall be required to prosecute the war, and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the semiannual interest upon it, and ultimately to extinguish the principal. If in addition to these duties Congress should graduate and reduce the price of such of the public lands as experience has proved will not command the price placed upon them by the Government, an additional annual income to the Treasury of between half a million and a million of dollars, it is estimated, would be derived from this source. Should both measures receive the sanction of Congress, the annual amount of public debt necessary to be contracted during the continuance of the war would be reduced near $4,000,000. The duties recommended to be levied on tea and coffee it is proposed shall be limited in their duration to the end of the war, and until the public debt rendered necessary to be contracted by it shall be discharged. The amount of the public debt to be contracted should be limited to the lowest practicable sum, and should be extinguished as early after the conclusion of the war as the means of the Treasury will permit.
With this view, it is recommended that as soon as the war shall be over all the surplus in the Treasury not needed for other indispensable objects shall constitute a sinking fund and be applied to the purchase of the funded debt, and that authority be conferred by laws for that purpose. The act of the 6th of August, 1846, ""to establish a warehousing system,"" has been in operation more than a year, and has proved to be an important auxiliary to the tariff act of 1846 in augmenting the revenue and extending the commerce of the country. Whilst it has tended to enlarge commerce, it has been beneficial to our manufactures by diminishing forced sales at auction of foreign goods at low prices to raise the duties to be advanced on them, and by checking fluctuations in the market. The system, although sanctioned by the experience of other countries, was entirely new in the United States, and is susceptible of improvement in some of its provisions. The Secretary of the Treasury, upon whom was devolved large discretionary powers in carrying this measure into effect, has collected and is now collating the practical results of the system in other countries where it has long been established, and will report at an early period of your session such further regulations suggested by the investigation as may render it still more effective and beneficial.
By the act to ""provide for the better organization of the Treasury and for the collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public revenue"" all banks were discontinued as fiscal agents of the Government, and the paper currency issued by them was no longer permitted to be received in payment of public dues. The constitutional treasury created by this act went into operation on the 1st of January last. Under the system established by it the public moneys have been collected, safely kept, and disbursed by the direct agency of officers of the Government in gold and silver, and transfers of large amounts have been made from points of collection to points of disbursement without loss to the Treasury or injury or inconvenience to the trade of the country.
While the fiscal operations of the Government have been conducted with regularity and ease under this system, it has had a salutary effect in checking and preventing an undue inflation of the paper currency issued by the banks which exist under State charters. Requiring, as it does, all dues to the Government to be paid in gold and silver, its effect is to restrain excessive issues of bank paper by the banks disproportioned to the specie in their vaults, for the reason that they are at all times liable to be called on by the holders of their notes for their redemption in order to obtain specie for the payment of duties and other public dues. The banks, therefore, must keep their business within prudent limits, and be always in a condition to meet such calls, or run the hazard of being compelled to suspend specie payments and be thereby discredited. The amount of specie imported into the United States during the last fiscal year was $24,121,289, of which there was retained in the country $22,276,170. Had the former financial system prevailed and the public moneys been placed on deposit in the banks, nearly the whole of this amount would have gone into their vaults, not to be thrown into circulation by them, but to be withheld from the hands of the people as a currency and made the basis of new and enormous issues of bank paper. A large proportion of the specie imported has been paid into the Treasury for public dues, and after having been to a great extent recoined at the Mint has been paid out to the public creditors and gone into circulation as a currency among the people. The amount of gold and silver coin now in circulation in the country is larger than at any former period.
The financial system established by the constitutional treasury has been thus far eminently successful in its operations, and I recommend an adherence to all its essential provisions, and especially to that vital provision which wholly separates the Government from all connection with banks and excludes bank paper from all revenue receipts.
In some of its details, not involving its general principles, the system is defective and will require modification. These defects and such amendments as are deemed important were set forth in the last annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury. These amendments are again recommended to the early and favorable consideration of Congress.
During the past year the coinage at the Mint and its branches has exceeded $20,000,000. This has consisted chiefly in converting the coins of foreign countries into American coin.
The largest amount of foreign coin imported has been received at New York, and if a branch mint were established at that city all the foreign coin received at that port could at once be converted into our own coin without the expense, risk, and delay of transporting it to the Mint for that purpose, and the amount recoined would be much larger.
Experience has proved that foreign coin, and especially foreign gold coin, will not circulate extensively as a currency among the people. The important measure of extending our specie circulation, both of gold and silver, and of diffusing it among the people can only be effected by converting such foreign coin into American coin. I repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message for the establishment of a branch of the Mint of the United States at the city of New York.
All the public lands which had been surveyed and were ready for market have been proclaimed for sale during the past year. The quantity offered and to be offered for sale under proclamations issued since the 1st of January last amounts to 9,138,531 acres. The prosperity of the Western States and Territories in which these lands lie will be advanced by their speedy sale. By withholding them from market their growth and increase of population would be retarded, while thousands of our enterprising and meritorious frontier population would be deprived of the opportunity of securing freeholds for themselves and their families. But in addition to the general considerations which rendered the early sale of these lands proper, it was a leading object at this time to derive as large a sum as possible from this source, and thus diminish by that amount the public loan rendered necessary by the existence of a foreign war.
In my last annual message I presented the reasons which in my judgment rendered it proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the public lands as have remained unsold for long periods after they had been offered for sale at public auction.
Many millions of acres of public lands lying within the limits of several of the Western States have been offered in the market and been subject to sale at private entry for more than twenty years and large quantities for more than thirty years at the lowest price prescribed by the existing laws, and it has been found that they will not command that price. They must remain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period unless the price demanded for them by the Government shall be reduced. No satisfactory reason is perceived why they should be longer held at rates above their real value. At the present period an additional reason exists for adopting the measure recommended. When the country is engaged in a foreign war, and we must necessarily resort to loans, it would seem to be the dictate of wisdom that we should avail ourselves of all our resources and thus limit the amount of the public indebtedness to the lowest possible sum.
I recommend that the existing laws on the subject of preemption rights be amended and modified so as to operate prospectively and to embrace all who may settle upon the public lands and make improvements upon them, before they are surveyed as well as afterwards, in all cases where such settlements may be made after the Indian title shall have been extinguished.
If the right of preemption be thus extended, it will embrace a large and meritorious class of our citizens. It will increase the number of small freeholders upon our borders, who will be enabled thereby to educate their children and otherwise improve their condition, while they will be found at all times, as they have ever proved themselves to be in the hour of danger to their country, among our hardiest and best volunteer soldiers, ever ready to attend to their services in cases of emergencies and among the last to leave the field as long as an enemy remains to be encountered. Such a policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer emigrants with deeper feelings of gratitude for the parental care of their Government, when they find their dearest interests secured to them by the permanent laws of the land and that they are no longer in danger of losing their homes and hard-earned improvements by being brought into competition with a more wealthy class of purchasers at the land sales. The attention of Congress was invited at their last and the preceding session to the importance of establishing a Territorial government over our possessions in Oregon, and it is to be regretted that there was no legislation on the subject. Our citizens who inhabit that distant region of country are still left without the protection of our laws, or any regularly organized government. Before the question of limits and boundaries of the Territory of Oregon was definitely settled, from the necessity of their condition the inhabitants had established a temporary government of their own. Besides the want of legal authority for continuing such a government, it is wholly inadequate to protect them in their rights of person and property, or to secure to them the enjoyment of the privileges of other citizens, to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United States. They should have the right of suffrage, be represented in a Territorial legislature and by a Delegate in Congress, and possess all the rights and privileges which citizens of other portions of the territories of the United States have heretofore enjoyed or may now enjoy.
Our judicial system, revenue laws, laws regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and the protection of our laws generally should be extended over them.
In addition to the inhabitants in that Territory who had previously emigrated to it, large numbers of our citizens have followed them during the present year, and it is not doubted that during the next and subsequent years their numbers will be greatly increased.
Congress at its last session established post routes leading to Oregon, and between different points within that Territory, and authorized the establishment of post-offices at ""Astoria and such other places on the coasts of the Pacific within the territory of the United States as the public interests may require."" Post-offices have accordingly been established, deputy postmasters appointed, and provision made for the transportation of the mails.
The preservation of peace with the Indian tribes residing west of the Rocky Mountains will render it proper that authority should be given by law for the appointment of an adequate number of Indian agents to reside among them.
I recommend that a surveyor-general's office be established in that Territory, and that the public lands be surveyed and brought into market at an early period.
I recommend also that grants, upon liberal terms, of limited quantities of the public lands be made to all citizens of the United States who have emigrated, or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate, to Oregon and settle upon them. These hardy and adventurous citizens, who have encountered the dangers and privations of a long and toilsome journey, and have at length found an abiding place for themselves and their families upon the utmost verge of our western limits, should be secured in the homes which they have improved by their labor. I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War for a detailed account of the operations of the various branches of the public service connected with the Department under his charge. The duties devolving on this Department have been unusually onerous and responsible during the past year, and have been discharged with ability and success.
Pacific relations continue to exist with the various Indian tribes, and most of them manifest a strong friendship for the United States. Some depredations were committed during the past year upon our trains transporting supplies for the Army, on the road between the western border of Missouri and Santa Fe. These depredations, which are supposed to have been committed by bands from the region of New Mexico, have been arrested by the presence of a military force ordered out for that purpose. Some outrages have been perpetrated by a portion of the northwestern bands upon the weaker and comparatively defenseless neighboring tribes. Prompt measures were taken to prevent such occurrences in future.
Between 1,000 and 2,000 Indians, belonging to several tribes, have been removed during the year from the east of the Mississippi to the country allotted to them west of that river as their permanent home, and arrangements have been made for others to follow.
Since the treaty of 1846 with the Cherokees the feuds among them appear to have subsided, and they have become more united and contented than they have been for many years past. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the act of June 27, 1846, to settle claims arising under the treaty of 1835-36 with that tribe have executed their duties, and after a patient investigation and a full and fair examination of all the cases brought before them closed their labors in the month of July last. This is the fourth board of commissioners which has been organized under this treaty. Ample opportunity has been afforded to all those interested to bring forward their claims. No doubt is entertained that impartial justice has been done by the late board, and that all valid claims embraced by the treaty have been considered and allowed. This result and the final settlement to be made with this tribe under the treaty of 1846, which will be completed and laid before you during your session, will adjust all questions of controversy between them and the United States and produce a state of relations with them simple, well defined, and satisfactory. Under the discretionary authority conferred by the act of the 3d of March last the annuities due to the various tribes have been paid during the present year to the heads of families instead of to their chiefs or such persons as they might designate, as required by the law previously existing. This mode of payment has given general satisfaction to the great body of the Indians. Justice has been done to them, and they are grateful to the Government for it. A few chiefs and interested persons may object to this mode of payment, but it is believed to be the only mode of preventing fraud and imposition from being practiced upon the great body of common Indians, constituting a majority of all the tribes. It is gratifying to perceive that a number of the tribes have recently manifested an increased interest in the establishment of schools among them, and are making rapid advances in agriculture, some of them producing a sufficient quantity of food for their support and in some cases a surplus to dispose of to their neighbors. The comforts by which those who have received even a very limited education and have engaged in agriculture are surrounded tend gradually to draw off their less civilized brethren from the precarious means of subsistence by the chase to habits of labor and civilization.
The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a satisfactory and gratifying account of the condition and operations of the naval service during the past year. Our commerce has been pursued with increased activity and with safety and success in every quarter of the globe under the protection of our flag, which the Navy has caused to be respected in the most distant seas.
In the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific the officers and men of our squadrons have displayed distinguished gallantry and performed valuable services. In the early stages of the war with Mexico her ports on both coasts were blockaded, and more recently many of them have been captured and held by the Navy. When acting in cooperation with the land forces, the naval officers and men have performed gallant and distinguished services on land as well as on water, and deserve the high commendation of the country.
While other maritime powers are adding to their navies large numbers of war steamers, it was a wise policy on our part to make similar additions to our Navy. The four war steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March, 1847, are in course of construction.
In addition to the four war steamers authorized by this act, the Secretary of the Navy has, in pursuance of its provisions, entered into contracts for the construction of five steamers to be employed in the transportation of the United States mail ""from New York to New Orleans, touching at Charleston, Savannah, and Havana, and from Havana to Chagres;"" for three steamers to be employed in like manner from Panama to Oregon, ""so as to connect with the mail from Havana to Chagres across the Isthmus;"" and for five steamers to be employed in like manner from New York to Liverpool. These steamers will be the property of the contractors, but are to be built ""under the superintendence and direction of a naval constructor in the employ of the Navy Department, and to be so constructed as to render them convertible at the least possible expense into war steamers of the first class."" A prescribed number of naval officers, as well as a post-office agent, are to be on board of them, and authority is reserved to the Navy Department at all times to ""exercise control over said steamships"" and ""to have the right to take them for the exclusive use and service of the United States upon making proper compensation to the contractors therefor.""
Whilst these steamships will be employed in transporting the mails of the United States coastwise and to foreign countries upon an annual compensation to be paid to the owners, they will be always ready, upon an emergency requiring it, to be converted into war steamers; and the right reserved to take them for public use will add greatly to the efficiency and strength of this description of our naval force. To the steamers thus authorized under contracts made by the Secretary of the Navy should be added five other steamers authorized under contracts made in pursuance of laws by the Postmaster-General, making an addition, in the whole, of eighteen war steamers subject to be taken for public use. As further contracts for the transportation of the mail to foreign countries may be authorized by Congress, this number may be enlarged indefinitely.
The enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various distant parts of the globe is established, by means of American built sea steamers, would find an ample reward in the increase of our commerce and in making our country and its resources more favorably known abroad; but the national advantage is still greater--of having our naval officers made familiar with steam navigation and of having the privilege of taking the ships already equipped for immediate service at a moment's notice, and will be cheaply purchased by the compensation to be paid for the transportation of the mail in them over and above the postages received.
A just national pride, no less than our commercial interests, would Seem to favor the policy of augmenting the number of this description of vessels. They can be built in our country cheaper and in greater numbers than in any other in the world.
I refer you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General for a detailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operations of that Department during the past year. It is gratifying to find that within so short a period after the reduction in the rates of postage, and notwithstanding the great increase of mail service, the revenue received for the year will be sufficient to defray all the expenses, and that no further aid will be required from the Treasury for that purpose.
The first of the American mail steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March, 1845, was completed and entered upon the service on the 1st of June last, and is now on her third voyage to Bremen and other intermediate ports. The other vessels authorized under the provisions of that act are in course of construction, and will be put upon the line as soon as completed. Contracts have also been made for the transportation of the mail in a steamer from Charleston to Havana.
A reciprocal and satisfactory postal arrangement has been made by the Postmaster-General with the authorities of Bremen, and no difficulty is apprehended in making similar arrangements with all other powers with which we may have communications by mail steamers, except with Great Britain.
On the arrival of the first of the American steamers bound to Bremen at Southampton, in the month of June last, the British post-office directed the collection of discriminating postages on all letters and other mailable matter which she took out to Great Britain or which went into the British post-office on their way to France and other parts of Europe. The effect of the order of the British, post-office is to subject all letters and other matter transported by American steamers to double postage, one postage having been previously paid on them to the United States, while letters transported in British steamers are subject to pay but a single postage. This measure was adopted with the avowed object of protecting the British line of mail steamers now running between Boston and Liverpool, and if permitted to Continue must speedily put an end to the transportation of all letters and other matter by American steamers and give to British steamers a monopoly of the business. A just and fair reciprocity is all that we desire, and on this we must insist. By our laws no such discrimination is made against British steamers bringing letters into our ports, but all letters arriving in the United States are subject to the same rate of postage, whether brought in British or American vessels. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General for a full statement of the facts of the case and of the steps taken by him to correct this inequality. He has exerted all the power conferred upon him by the existing laws.
The minister of the United States at London has brought the subject to the attention of the British Government, and is now engaged in negotiations for the purpose of adjusting reciprocal postal arrangements which shall be equally just to both countries. Should he fail in concluding such arrangements, and should Great Britain insist on enforcing the unequal and unjust measure she has adopted, it will become necessary to confer additional powers on the Postmaster-General in order to enable him to meet the emergency and to put our own steamers on an equal footing with British steamers engaged in transporting the mails between the two countries, and I recommend that such powers be conferred. In view of the existing state of our country, I trust it may not be inappropriate, in closing this communication, to call to mind the words of wisdom and admonition of the first and most illustrious of my predecessors in his Farewell Address to his countrymen.
That greatest and best of men, who served his country so long and loved it so much, foresaw with ""serious concern"" the danger to our Union of ""characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western--whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views,"" and warned his countrymen against it.
So deep and solemn was his conviction of the importance of the Union and of preserving harmony between its different parts, that he declared to his countrymen in that address:
It is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.
After the lapse of half a century these admonitions of Washington fall upon us with all the force of truth. It is difficult to estimate the ""immense value"" of our glorious Union of confederated States, to which we are so much indebted for our growth in population and wealth and for all that constitutes us a great and a happy nation. How unimportant are all our differences of opinion upon minor questions of public policy compared with its preservation, and how scrupulously should we avoid all agitating topics which may tend to distract and divide us into contending parties, separated by geographical lines, whereby it may be weakened or endangered.
Invoking the blessing of the Almighty Ruler of the Universe upon your deliberations, it will be my highest duty, no less than my sincere pleasure, to cooperate with you in all measures which may tend to promote the honor and enduring welfare of our common country.

Warren G. Harding,United States of America,1920-08-28 00:00:00,"I greet you in a spirit of rejoicing. Not a rejoicing in the narrow partisan or personal sense, not in the gratifying prospect of party triumph, but I rejoice that America is still free and independent and in a position of self-reliance, opposed to the right of self-determination.
Let us take stock for a moment of America in the world, aye, and of America at home. The end of the war found our unselfishness emphasized to all mankind. The garlands of world leadership were bestowed from every direction. We had only to follow the path of America, rejoicing in the inheritance which led to our eminence, to rivet the gaze of all peoples upon our standards of national righteousness and our conception of international justice. 
Moreover, the world was ready to give us its confidence. It was the beckoning opportunity of the century, not for the glorification of this New World republic, but for America to hold every outpost of advancing civilization and invite all nations to join the further advance to heights dreamed of, but never before approached.
But force of example was slung aside for force of armed alliance. We neglected our restorations at home, and the sacrifice of millions of lives left us and the world groping in anxiety, instead of revealing us in the sunlight of a new day with lines formed, ready for the onward march of peace and all its triumphs. Mindful of our splendid examples, and renewing every obligation of association in war, I want America to be the rock of security at home, resolute in righteousness and supremacy of the law. Our moral leadership in the world was lost when ambition sought to superimpose a reactionary theory of discredited autocracy upon the progressive principle of living, glowing democracy.
My deep aspiration, my countrymen, if clothed with power, will be to regain that lost leadership, not for myself, not even for my party, though honoring and trusting it as I do, but for the country that I love from the bottom of my heart, with every fiber of my being, above all else in the world.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2014-08-16,"Well, I think that your new prime minister has been amazing and I speak from a person that looks from outside in. Coming from New York the United States. I will say that his image and the way he's handled himself has been brilliant. He seems to have been a person that's been able to unite India and bring all factions together and I think he's done an incredible job of unification.
And again that's so important for India because India was very divisive at one point and people were afraid to invest in India. I think they have great confidence in the new prime minister. So I congratulate India on that. And you know, look, India is an amazing country a great country. And now with leadership and I think you now have the right leadership it tremendous things will happen for India.
Well, I know so many people from India. They live in my buildings in New York part-time because they are from India but they live -- They have apartments in Trump Tower and Trump World Tower and Trump International Hotel, and so many different places and they're tremendous people, they're tremendous people.
Many are friends of mine. And so many of them, they just love this country. They feel so strongly and so passionately about the country and I think that may be rubbed off on me. So when we had the opportunity to do a great project in Mumbai with a great developer, Lodha Group, they're fantastic and real professionals and we jumped at it. You know, will turn down 20 and 30 uni -- deals for everyone we do. We turned down many, many deals and because I don't want to do, we don't need them, it doesn't matter but we only want to do the ones that are important and the ones that can be great and we think this -- we thing Trump Tower in Mumbai is going to be a great project.
Well, I think so. Emerging markets. I don't consider this an emerging market I consider this an amazing market. I think it's just unique. One of the things I've seen in Mumbai is that cities which aren't anything compared to Mumbai, the prices are much higher than in Mumbai per square foot per, square meter.
And I'm saying, you know, that's my kind of place because I'd like to get in there early. So I look at pricing in Mumbai to be so inexpensive. When you look at London and you look at New York and you look at so many other cities and then you look at lesser cities where the price is higher than Mumbai and it never made sense to me and that's one of the reasons we're doing the job.
Well, I feel strongly about China also. I mean China is an incredible country obviously, and I think China is going to be you know another real power it already is. We'll be doing things in China and we'll be doing additional things in India.
Well, we're doing great buildings. They're both going to be great buildings, very luxury, very high end. And frankly, we didn't have to do as much as we did. We could have gotten away, probably, with the same pricing and done a lot less than we're doing. But we feel it's very important to come in with a bang and do it properly.
So in both those instances, we are going to do something really special and they're going to be great jobs. And Mumbai, where we -- we haven't even really gone out. We've already sold over 100 units as I understand it and we opened the sales office this afternoon. We haven't even opened a sales office. So people are loving it and they love the location they love the building but they are really loving the product.
So we're very happy about that.
Well there is no brand like Trump. We have the hottest brand in the world right now and there's no brand like Trump. It's done tremendously all over the world. And I think Laura did the right thing when they called us because they knew what they were doing and additionally with real estate, we know what we're doing in real estate.
Some of these brands are like celebrity names or celebrity whatever it may be fashion names but they know nothing about construction, they know nothing about concrete and glass. I know everything about those things. So we had a lot to do with the design of the building and the beauty of the building and really the functionality of the building.
So we had a lot. And in addition to that, we had the best brand.
What we're looking at a number of other deals. It's really, and as I said before it's absolutely quality over quantity. We could do many jobs. I could leave today and sign a pocketful of jobs. I don't want to do that. It's -- for us, it's absolute quality is much more important than quantity and that's why we're doing Mumbai.
That's what we're doing -- you mentioned two names. I mean we're doing these two and the only reason we're doing them is for the quality of it. We think they have tremendous potential. We could do many other jobs. We didn't like what we saw.
Oh, I think we'll have other deals I think we'll be doing hotels in India. We'll be doing a lot in India. India is an amazing place. I know it well and it's an amazing place.
Well, I think just keep doing good work and don't give up and keep working hard and pricing in India is not like it is in other places. Pricing in India is not as high in many sections and when I look at Mumbai and I look at the pricing it never made sense to me because it seems so low. But I think to other developers or other entrepreneurs -- You know, one thing about entrepreneurship you have to love what you do and you can never ever quit or give up. Those are the two keys and you have to have a good idea or product.
Well, I think that you do have -- you have great entrepreneurs in India. I think that's a natural thing. It's almost a natural thing for India but you have some of the great entrepreneurs in India and a tremendous flock of new ones coming up and that's a very important thing that's going to bring economics and money and lots of good things to India.
I think it is a trauma and is going to bring jobs and that is a good thing for India.
Well, it's not a priority to us, to be honest. And if you talk about a fund we don't need money. So if you don't need money there's no real reason. And we do for our own account. You know, we don't do for others, we do for our own account and we love building great projects and we love, in some cases, keeping them or in some cases selling units to people so they can benefit but fund is not something that's overly interesting to me.
Right.
I loved Atlantic City. I was very successful in Atlantic City but I left many years ago and they have my name on the building and they're not operating in a standard that is good for my name and so we've sued to get the name taken off the building, which will be, I think, successful. It's not a big thing but it's important for us. I would say that generally speaking that will never happen to India.
Atlantic City was absolutely overrun with competition from so many states and I guess 80% of the casinos in Atlantic City are gone or gone bankrupt and a lot of bad things happen. My timing -- a lot of people say my timing was very good because I left at a certain period of time and had a great relationship with Atlantic City.
But when somebody is using my name they have to keep it at the highest levels and they weren't able to do that, so that's why we're doing that.
Well that's true and that's why so important have a great partner and I don't see a thing like that happening in India it's a different kind of a world, a different kind of a market. It's a much bigger market. Obviously, Atlantic City is not a big market. India is too important for that to happen.
Not really. A real estate is my thing. You know I've had great success in other things The Apprentice was the No. 1 show in the United States, continues to be a great success and who would have known that I was going to become a television star but it happened. Another thing that was very successful, I wrote a book and the book became the No. 1 business book ever of all time, as I understand it, and that was called Trump: The Art of the deal.
And so a lot of things have happened to me that I wouldn't have expected but real estate is my big deal and it is my big passion.
Well, I'll look at it. The United States is not being properly run and I will take a strong look at it. We have a big election coming up in November, in particular, the Senate, which I think the Republicans will take. And after that, I'll give it very serious consideration. I will look. I don't what happened last time.
Romney ran he lost. Something happened to him and I can't tell you exactly what happened because it's an election that shouldn't have been lost. But I will take a very serious look at that.
Well, I think if I ran I'd do very well. I love what I'm doing. I love being in Mumbai today with Lodha and the whole group and doing this building. I really enjoy what I do. That's the thing I have most against running for president. But at the same time, the country needs leadership and if it's not gonna get it -- If I don't see somebody that I think can do a great job, I will certainly consider it.
",Interview: Nikhil Sivadas Interviews Donald Trump on NDTV New Delhi,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-ndtv-the-property-show-august-16-2014
Patrick McNair-Wilson,United Kingdom,2020-04-20,"I wish to refer to two points in the Gracious Speech—Rhodesia and inflation and the incomes policy.
We read with interest and optimism that the Government intend to strive with the United States for a peaceful settlement in the Rhodesian rebellion. I urge the Government to go beyond that. I believe that a final appeal is now required to ask Mr. Smith to abandon the rebellion and to renounce the unilateral declaration of independence. As long as that country remains in rebellion against the Crown, there is no way in which Mr. Smith can receive recognition either from countries such as the United States and others in the developed world or from the guerrilla leaders who surround him.
Rhodesia has become a country in which it is no longer safe for people to go outside Salisbury and Bulawayo. We have to look towards renunciation of this illegal act of 1965 if we are to find a proper solution. I should like a governor-general to be appointed—a man with ​ very special qualities—who would ensure, if there was a renunciation, proper elections adequately supervised by someone from this country.
I should like there to be an amnesty for terrorists and an appeal made for Mr. Nkomo and the others to join in some sort of constitutional settlement. In the interim, let us make it clear that even if Mr. Smith renounces UDI we shall use the internal settlement as a framework upon which we can build. My fear is that that will not happen. Although Mr. Smith has made it crystal clear that he intends to give up politics in Rhodesia, I fear that he will cling on too late and for too long and that there will be a bloodbath in that country.
I should therefore like to feel that the Government, in implementing this part of the Gracious Speech, would make that direct appeal to Mr. Smith to lay down his sword to his Sovereign and to bring that country once again back into legality. I do not intend to comment on Bingham, sanctions and the rest, but I believe that that appeal would be well worth making, even at this eleventh hour.
Not surprisingly, the Prime Minister devoted much of his speech this afternoon to the question of inflation and the way in which we can conquer this problem in Britain. It is a problem which we have seen sweeping through many countries in the developed world. I think that all of us have started from quite the wrong premise, and, regrettably, the right hon. Gentleman’s speech continued it—namely, to blame wages for inflation. That is entirely wrong. I believe that wages are merely a reflection of inflation. Inflation is created by Governments.
I very vividly remember the right hon. As those of us who were here then will recall, that crisis of confidence led to a major run on our currency, and with it came the inevitable inflation, because if a country is one that requires, as we do, to buy so much from overseas, a weak currency leads to higher prices, and those higher prices eventually come through to the wage packet, which no longer buys what it bought the week before.
It is at that point that wage claims start to rise steeply. It is utterly wrong, however, to blame those who are demanding higher wages to match inflation for creating that inflation. It is the Government who bear the responsibility for doing that. Attacking those who are trying to protect their standards of life merely because they want to be able to buy what they bought the previous week for the same amount of money is quite the wrong thing to do.
Therefore, I find the juxtaposition of the paragraphs of the Gracious Speech of great interest. In paragraph 6 on page 4 we see the words:
“My Government are resolved to strengthen our democracy by providing new opportunities for citizens to take part in the decisions that affect their lives.”
What decision affecting the life of the ordinary person could be more important than his ability, in his short working life, to earn the reward to which the hard work that he puts in entitles him? Yet we are, in one breath, saying that we shall increase the opportunities for people to take part in discussions about democratic decisions while at the same time we have a Government, following upon the Government of my party, who are determined to control wages in a totally unacceptable manner.
The wages argument goes far deeper than merely the numbers game of percentage points. We are talking fundamentally about freedom and totalitarianism. We are talking about the freedom of people to negotiate their rewards from companies and people who employ them and the alternative of a Government who impose upon them what they are to earn.
I make no apology for opting for a free wage bargaining system. I recognise all the imperfections that exist in that. I am well aware of the attractiveness of the Government pulling a figure out of the air and saying to industry and commerce “Negotiate around that.” Certainly the Government have a responsibility to do their sums and to tell us what sort of figure they believe the country can afford. But they really cannot expect people to accept a figure such as that, across the board of every industry. How can an official in Whitehall or anywhere else determine whether people should be earning more or less, and whether a ​ company can afford to pay increases in salaries or whether it should not pay any increase at all?
With this concept, which now appears to be becoming part of the perpetual landscape, I believe that we are running away from that freedom and leaving totalitarian government, which will control all our lives, to decide how much we shall earn and ultimately where we shall earn, because if we accept the policy of wage control from the centre it will not be very long before we have the direction of labour, which will follow behind it.
I was interested in the television programme the other night in which my right hon. It was put to him very clearly by those who were talking with him that the only way they would accept a wages policy would be if there was control not only of wages but of prices, profits and dividends. If we are to have that sort of total control, we are moving into a whole new era of government in Britain that we have never seen before. That will mean a rigid control over everything that one can earn and save in one’s lifetime. I do not believe that that is what this country wants. I do not believe that today, with the exception of the Prime Minister and perhaps my right hon. Friend the Member for Sidcup, anyone believes any longer in the 5 per cent. wage policy. It has now become a complete fantasy.
Let us be very honest when we say that. If one recalls, as I recall vividly—perhaps all hon. Members recall it too—what happened in 1974, one realises that when the Prime Minister talks about the coming winter being a watershed, one should tell him that one predicts that it will also set the seal on his downfall, because the fact is that in February 1974 the Conservative Party was ordered over the top of the trench straight on to the barbed wire of the National Union of Mineworkers, and we never got off it, losing the General Election as a result.
What is happening now under the present Government is a re-run of that event. I cannot see that it will do this country any good to have an industrial head-on confrontation once again. It really is a suicide mission. It is no good the Prime Minister and his ​ friends telling us that the Government are only indicating what the country can afford. With the paraphernalia of the black list and all the other hidden persuaders that now exist in the Government’s armoury, we are producing not only something akin to a statutory policy but a situation in which the market forces which one has to have in industry are no longer able to work.
This afternoon the Prime Minister said that he wanted to know what the Ford wage claim would do to the price of Ford products. The fact is that if Ford products can be sold competitively against the products of the other car and truck manufacturers, what the claim does to Ford prices is irrelevant. What is important is that we in Britain are able to compete with the competition. It is not a question of pulling tidy figures out of the Treasury. It is a question of a company such as Ford being able to decide what it can afford and paying it.
Until we get back to an economy which enables individuals, whether they be owners of businesses or workers in businesses, to have the freedom to negotiate on the basis of the profitability of their industries and what can be afforded, we are heading down that dangerous road to totalitarianism, be it of the Left or of the Right, which will ultimately undermine our whole society.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-02-28,"So this is Historically Black Colleges and Universities executive order. Very important to all of us. This group has been fantastic, and many of which we were with yesterday and really developed something very special. So thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, also -- Mike, for being here.
This is a very important moment, and a moment that means a great deal to me. This month has been a wonderful opportunity to celebrate African-American history, and to begin working together to create a better future for African-Americans and universities and colleges, and everything that is African-American. Today, we're taking action to help make that future happen and that future better.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities are incredibly important institutions, woven into the fabric of our history just about like no other. Church is very important, right? Colleges and universities. Mike is my defender. It has the power to transform. And, perhaps most important, education has the power to create greater equality and justice in our lives.
That's why today I'm thrilled to be signing an executive order to recognize the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Very important. They have played such an important role in achieving progress for African-Americans and in our nation's march for justice. HBCUs have been really pillars of the African-American community for more than 150 years -- amazing job -- and a grand and enduring symbol of America at its absolute best. And I congratulate you all.
With this executive order, we will make HBCUs a priority in the White House -- an absolute priority.
And so I just want to congratulate -- these are very, very special people surrounding me. You've done an amazing job. It's not easy. Nothing is easy. But you've done an amazing job. And I just want to congratulate you all, and I want to thank you on behalf of our country.
And so I'm going to sign this. This is really fantastic.

Dominic Raab,United Kingdom,2019-09-25,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on Iran.
The United Kingdom has always been clear-sighted about our engagement with Iran. We want to see Iran come in from the cold, but that can happen only if Iran shows the respect required for the basic principles of the rules-based international system.
Iran’s violations are not mere technical breaches of international rules; they are serious and systemic destabilising actions that undermine the international rule of law. Those actions must have consequences. Take first the recent attacks on the Aramco facilities in Saudi Arabia. On 14 September, 18 drones and seven cruise missiles hit an oil field and a processing facility.
As the UK Government, we took our time to assess the facts carefully and independently. We are now confident that Iran was responsible. The evidence is clear and there is no plausible alternative explanation. This conduct amounts to an armed attack on Saudi Arabia, a violation of one of the basic principles of international law under the United Nations charter.
The attacks caused serious damage in Saudi Arabia and affected 5% of the world’s oil supply. In those circumstances, the UK has sought, and will continue to seek, to de-escalate tensions. However, our response is also an acid test of our resolve. We have condemned the attacks in co-ordination not just with Saudi Arabia and the United States, but with our European partners. I draw the attention of the House to the E3 statement released yesterday after meetings in New York. We will now continue to work with the widest international support to determine the most effective response.
At the same time, Iran’s attacks on the Aramco facilities are a reminder of the importance of ensuring that Iran never gains access to nuclear weapons. That is why the UK remains committed to the 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action, notwithstanding US withdrawal. Equally, we have always recognised that it is not a perfect deal. The JCPOA has its strengths, including its provisions granting the International Atomic Energy Agency unfettered access to Iran’s nuclear facilities, but it also has its limitations. Its provisions are time limited, with some expiring next year, and it was never designed to address our long-standing concern about Iran’s wider destabilising behaviour in the region.
Since May, Iran has gradually reduced its compliance with key aspects of the JCPOA, putting the deal at risk. Before any wider progress is possible, Iran must reverse those steps and must come back into full compliance. At the same time, as both President Trump and President Macron have said, we can improve upon the JCPOA. Ultimately, we need a longer-term framework that provides greater certainty over Iran’s nuclear programme and, as the attacks on Aramco demonstrate, we must also bring Iran’s wider destabilising activities into scope. That includes putting an end to Iran’s violations of the freedom of navigation, which are disrupting shipping in the strait of Hormuz and undermining the international law of the sea.
Alongside our partners—the US, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain—we remain committed to the International Maritime Security Construct to ensure freedom of navigation in the region. We also welcome the European-led initiatives to achieve the same goals. We want the widest international support to uphold the rules-based international order.
We must also see an end to Iran’s interference in Yemen, which has stoked further conflict through support for the Houthi rebels and fuelled the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world today. A political solution is the only viable way to bring peace to that terrible conflict. Iran must start to play a constructive, instead of destructive, role in that conflict.
Finally, when it comes to respecting international law, Iran’s dire human rights record continues to be a serious concern to the United Kingdom, especially its practice of arbitrary detention of dual nationals. Today a range of UK dual nationals are languishing in jail in Iran. They have typically been arrested on spurious charges, denied due process and subjected to mistreatment, contrary to the basic tenets of international human rights law. This practice causes great anguish and suffering not just to those detained but to their families.
Iran’s behaviour is unlawful, cruel and totally unacceptable. I have raised all these cases, along with Iran’s wider conduct, with Foreign Minister Zarif, and the Prime Minister raised the cases with President Rouhani yesterday in New York. We will continue to press for their release.
Iran’s record of respect for the basic rules of international law is woeful, and it is getting worse. Let us be clear about this and about the Iranian Government’s responsibility for the plight of their own people. It is a matter of political choice—their Government’s choice—yet, even now, we retain the hope that we can work with Iran and with our international partners to de-escalate tensions, to rebuild confidence and to establish a clear path for Iran towards international respectability.
Iran is a proud nation with a rich history and remarkable economic potential. It is held back by a regime that fails to respect the fundamental tenets of the rules-based international system. Iran faces a choice: it can double down on its approach, in which case the international opposition to its behaviour will only intensify; or it can take immediate steps to de-escalate tensions and rebuild international confidence by respecting international law and reducing the range of threats it presents to its neighbours. That is the only path to stability and prosperity for Iran and the wider region, and I commend this statement to the House.

Liam Fox,United Kingdom,2019-04-14,"After years of war, there is much talk in this country about peace. This is a welcome change. But peace is not simply the absence of war.
A genuine peace requires other, positive attributes. It requires freedom from fear-the fear of hunger, the fear of sickness, the fear of persecution.
It requires freedom of expression including a free press and broadcast media. It requires freedom to dissent within the law. And it is a law that must be applied without regard to race, gender or religion, accepting fundamental human rights. It is a law that must apply equally to the governed and the governing.
Sri Lanka is a fortunate country. It has seen decades of violence and terror under the LTTE brought to an end. It has a constitution and a judicial system that should be the foundations of a peaceful, tolerant and progressive society.
This is a country with huge natural wealth and economic potential. Yet too many Sri Lankans have been denied access to this potential. I have visited camps where children from the war zone have never been to school. I saw other children brutalised by a life as child soldiers, totally unaware of the existence of a different lifestyle that so many others take for granted. For those returning home from the camps there must be a new start with access to quality social infrastructure-good housing, education and healthcare. All Sri Lankans, of whatever ethnic group, must share equally in the future of this country or the country will never reach its full potential.
Of course, such infrastructure requires money. That is why I have brought plans with me for the creation of a new fund which can help provide basic social infrastructure for the reconstruction that this country will need if the end of the violence is to develop into a sustainable peace. I am extremely grateful for the support I have received across the political spectrum and from religious leaders. We will be signing a memorandum of understanding for the workings and next steps in establishing this fund and will set out details in the near future. I hope this initiative we will give the people of Sri Lanka, and particularly the Tamil people in the North and East, the tools they need to ensure that opportunity and prosperity are the inheritance of all the people of this island.
There is however a political problem which needs to be addressed if the outside world is to have confidence that Sri Lanka is a stable place in which to invest. The President won a huge victory and deserves congratulations. But the situation surrounding General Fonseka threatens to damage Sri Lanka’s international reputation . At a crucial time for this country’s future it cannot afford to have the prosecution of such a senior military officer portrayed as an act of revenge. It is not for any outside nation or body to determine who should or should not be tried in this country but how such trials are conducted will play a huge role in how this country is perceived abroad. The law not only has to be applied fairly but has to be seen to be applied fairly. It is my strong view that the General should be tried in a civil court where the charges against him can be tested with all the rigour that the law can muster and where transparency will enable both the domestic population and the international community to have confidence in the judicial process.

Theresa May,United Kingdom,2018-09-26,"This week political leaders have come to New York to discuss how we can work together to ensure the future prosperity and security of our people.
And it’s right that many of these discussions are taking place at the United Nations.
But it is also right that I have come here to this Bloomberg forum, because we will only succeed if we also work in partnership with you, some of the most pioneering business leaders in the world today.
It is businesses like yours which have been great engines of job creation and growth – in my country, here in America and right around the world.
And it is the embrace of open economies and free trade as drivers of innovation and growth that has underpinned your success and acted as the greatest agent of collective human progress.
Where free markets have been properly regulated, and trade and investment unleashed, we have seen unprecedented levels of wealth and opportunity, rising life expectancy, greater access to education, falling infant mortality and reductions in absolute poverty on a scale which would once have been hard to imagine.
And as governments we have played our part in helping to make this possible by agreeing and abiding by a global framework of rules, and by opening up our economies to competition.
But today new challenges – including the rapid pace and breadth of technological change – are causing some to question their faith in the institutions of global co-operation and the framework of rules which has brought us to this point.
They look at who gains from free trade and ask whether this global economic system is fair and whether it can really be made to work for everyone.
They look at the growth of artificial intelligence and ask whether their children and grandchildren will have the skills to succeed in the new economy.
And they look at some of the tensions in global trade today and ask whether the rules based system can be really adapted to reflect the realities of the modern world.
My answer to all of these questions is a bold and optimistic yes.
And my message today is that a post-Brexit Britain will be an unequivocally pro-business Britain – and a global partner that will help to lead the international response to those challenges.
Through our Modern Industrial Strategy at home we will create one of the most dynamic and business-friendly economies in the world – driving investment opportunities for your businesses and spreading the benefits of new sectors and technologies to every part of my country.
And internationally – as a Global Britain – we will champion our vision for the future of the global economy: a vision that is based on openness, innovation, competition, high quality and intelligent regulation.
And we will be at the forefront of sustained international efforts to address the challenges facing global trade and to build a dynamic and competitive global economy that can truly work for everyone.
I have always been clear what the United Kingdom stands for and what we want to achieve as we leave the European Union.
Our relationship with the EU will change with Brexit. But we will still be neighbours, we will still be part of the European family of nations, and we will continue to champion the same beliefs – standing for freedom, democracy and the rule of law, underpinned by a rules-based global order.
And that is why I am confident we can reach a deal about our future relationship that is built in this spirit.
We have put forward a plan for a new, but still close relationship, with frictionless trade at its heart.
There is no other plan that protects jobs and livelihoods and also meets our commitments in Northern Ireland, while respecting how people voted in the largest democratic exercise in our history. And I believe that behind the noise of the headlines and the chattering of the commentators, there is much common ground in these objectives.
We know that the other models on offer would not deliver for business, who would face either increased bureaucracy, additional border checks, or both. And so I have urged the EU to engage with our proposals so that we can move forward.
To be clear, we are not seeking partial membership of the Single Market, or in any way trying to undermine it. But we are looking to achieve the frictionless trade that I believe is in all of our interests.
There is clearly a lot further to go in the negotiations and the coming weeks will be critical.
For the prize is great: with the conclusion of the negotiations over the coming weeks, the certainty of an Implementation Period in which to adapt to the new arrangements, and the guarantee of frictionless trade with the EU in the future, businesses can look forward to the post-Brexit world with confidence.
At the same time, looking beyond the EU, we are absolutely committed to delivering continuity in terms of relationships with existing bi-lateral partners – and we want to forge the most dynamic and ambitious Free Trade Agreements with old friends and new allies alike.
Crucially we also have a plan to deliver an economy that is knowledge-rich, highly innovative, highly skilled and high quality but with low tax and smart regulation.
So let me say this very clearly.
Whatever your business, investing in a post-Brexit Britain will give you the lowest rate of Corporation Tax in the G20. You will access service industries and a financial centre in London that are the envy of the world, some of the best Universities in the world, strong institutions, a sound approach to public finance and a consistent and dependable approach to high standards but intelligent regulation.
And yes, locating in the UK, you will also be able to access the talent you need. Freedom of movement will end when we leave the European Union. But we will put in place a new immigration system that will allow businesses and universities to attract the brightest and best to the UK.
Furthermore, through our Modern Industrial Strategy we are bending the power of the state and the ingenuity of the private sector to solve four Grand Challenges of the future which are enormous areas of potential for growth, jobs and investment across our whole country.
These are the challenges of Clean Growth; Our Aging Society; the Future of Mobility; and the challenge of Artificial Intelligence and Data – where we have already seen more investment in the UK over the last 3 years than in the rest of Europe combined.
We are contributing the UK’s biggest ever increase in public investment in research and development, which will help develop new technologies in these four areas.
And we have set a goal of total public and private investment in research and development reaching 2.4 per cent of GDP by 2027.
We will educate and train our young people for the opportunities that meeting these four Grand Challenges will bring.
And we will ensure that we have smart, agile regulation and dynamic institutions which promote innovation, but also protect people’s rights. Just as we are doing, for example, with AI – where our Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation will make us a global leader in helping to ensure the safe, ethical and innovative deployment of this new life-changing technology.
At its heart, our Modern Industrial Strategy is about creating a different kind of economy for the future.
It’s not about seeing business and society as separate entities, where business generates a surplus and government then invests it to handle the social consequences of economic change.
But instead it is about harnessing the enormous power of business as a partner in tackling some of the greatest social challenges of our time.
It is not about telling business what to do, but instead genuinely listening to business and working in partnership with you.
It’s about understanding what you need and working together to shape our economy in a way that will help us make the UK one of the most attractive countries in the world in which to establish and grow a successful business.
Just as we work with you to create the best possible environment in which to invest in the UK, so I am also determined that a post-Brexit Britain will be a trusted partner at the forefront of efforts to address the real challenges facing the future of the global economy.
This means playing a leading role in tackling the root causes of the current tensions in global trade – where the rules have not kept pace with the modern world.
If a global system is going to function properly, the participants in that system need to believe that the rules and the commitments they make to one another are fundamentally fair.
They need to believe that others are playing by both the spirit and the letter of those rules, whether that be in terms of declaring what subsidies are provided or respecting intellectual property rights.
They need to believe that any disputes will be dealt with fairly and efficiently.
And the rules themselves need to remain relevant by keeping pace with the changing nature of trade and technology.
So we need to give the WTO a broad, ambitious and urgent mandate to reform, to address the areas where it is not functioning effectively, to deal with issues that are not currently covered and maintain trust in the system.
For example, we need to see new rules in areas such as digital trade and services, including e-commerce that can boost growth across these dynamic sectors.
We need WTO reforms to increase fairness for all participating countries; and to enhance global legitimacy and public support for the multilateral trading system, including through greater transparency.
We support the EU’s efforts in this area and, as we leave the EU, we will want to work with them and all our partners around the world, to push this forward and deliver a mandate for change.
As a global and independent trading nation, we will use all the means available to us – including our positions in the G7, G20, OECD, IMF and FSB to pursue this agenda in partnership with others committed to the same end.
And crucially we also want to make business central to the conversation because at the end of the day governments set the framework, but it is businesses that create wealth and drive innovation.
These challenges facing the global economy are serious – but a Global Britain will be a fully engaged and ambitious partner at the forefront of international efforts to drive reform.
And I look forward to hearing from you this morning and to discussing with you what more we can do – so that together we can shape the future of the global rules based system to work for the modern world.
And together we can harness the global power of open economies and free markets to deliver prosperity and opportunity for all – now and for generations to come.
",2018 Speech at Bloomberg Global Business Forum,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-may-2018-speech-at-bloomberg-global-business-forum/
Bernie Sanders,United States of America,2020-09-24,"Let me thank all of you for being here this afternoon. This country faces an unprecedented set of crises. We are struggling with a pandemic that has already cost us over 200,000 lives. We have an economy in which we have a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, where the middle-class today is being decimated, where millions of workers have lost their jobs, and half of our people continue to work paycheck to paycheck, many for starvation wages. We are living in the moment when climate change is ravaging. This planet leading to massive fires on the West coast, drought and unprecedented levels of extreme weather disturbances all across the globe. We are the only major country on earth, not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. Over 90 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured and we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. All of these issues and others are enormously important and should be the issues that are being debated in this campaign.
But today I am not going to talk about any of them. What I am going to talk about is something that in my wildest dreams, I never thought I would be discussing. And that is the need to make certain that the president of the United States, if he loses this election, will abide by the will of the voters and leave office peacefully. What I will be discussing today is the danger that this country faces from a president who is a pathological liar, who has strong authoritarian tendencies, who neither understands nor respects our constitution, and who is prepared to undermine American democracy in order to stay in power. With less than six weeks left to go in this campaign, it is my fervor and hope that all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives moderates, conservatives, come together to defend American democracy, our constitution, and the rule of law.
We must ensure in this unprecedented moment in American history, that this is an election that is free and fair, an election in which voters are not intimidated, an election in which all votes are counted, and an election in which the loser accepts the results. This is not just an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, this is an election between Donald Trump and democracy, and democracy must win. The United States is the oldest continuous democracy in the modern world. We held elections in the middle of a civil war in 1864. We held free and fair elections during World War I, during the Great Depression and during World War II-
Well, one, during the Great Depression and during World War II. After all of those elections held in extremely difficult circumstances, the loser acknowledged defeat and the winner was inaugurated and took office. That is what the United States of America is all about. That is what democracy is all about. But today onto Donald Trump, we have a president who has little respect for our constitution or the rule of law. Today, that peaceful transition of power, the bedrock of American democracy is being threatened like never before.
I am not in the habit of quoting former president Ronald Reagan, but I think something that he said in his first inaugural address makes the point about how important, how precious is this part of our heritage, and I quote Ronald Reagan, “The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stopped to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the world, this every four-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.” End of quote.
Protecting this orderly transfer of authority as president Reagan characterized it, this miracle is absolutely essential. If we together, all of us, Republicans, Democrats, Independents want to keep faith with the American ideals we hold so dear and with the sacrifices that so many made in order to protect our democracy. In that regard, I think it is terribly important that we actually listen to and take seriously what Donald Trump is saying. Several weeks ago, speaking at the Republican National Convention, Trump said, and I quote, “The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election.” End of quote.
What is remarkable about that statement is that he made it at a time when almost every national poll had him behind and when he was trailing in polls in most battleground states. Think about what that statement means. Think hard about what that statement means. What he is saying is that if he wins the election, that’s great. But if he loses, it’s rigged, because the only way, the only way he can lose is if it’s rigged, and if it’s rigged, then he is not leaving office. Heads I win, tails you lose. In other words, in Trump’s mind, there is no conceivable way that he should leave office.
Just last night, just last night, Donald Trump went even further down the path of authoritarianism by becoming the first president in the history of this country to refuse to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses the election. When asked by a reporter in the White House briefing room, “Win, lose or draw in this selection, will you commit here today for a peaceful transfer of power after the election?” Trump responded and I quote, “We’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I have been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster. We want to get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful… There won’t be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.” End of quote from Donald Trump.
That is not his choice. That’s for the American people to determined. Let us be very clear, there is nothing in our constitution or in our laws that gives Donald Trump the privilege of deciding whether or not he will step aside if he loses. In the United States, the president does not determine who can or cannot vote and what ballots will be counted. That may be what his friend Putin does in Russia. It may be what is done in other authoritarian countries, but it is not and it will not be done in America. This is a democracy.
Now, I do understand that Donald Trump is a billionaire or so he tells us. I do understand that he was born to a very wealthy family, and from his earliest days was able to get anything he wanted because his family was rich and his family was powerful. I do understand that when you’re rich and you’re powerful, you don’t have to pay taxes like ordinary people and that it’s easy for you to avoid the military draft. I do understand that when you’re rich and you’re powerful, you can buy politicians and get hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate welfare for your real estate empire.
But this I also understand, no matter how rich or powerful you may be, no matter how arrogant and narcissistic you may be, no matter how much you think you can get anything you want, let me make this clear to Donald Trump, too many people have fought and died to defend American democracy and you are not going to destroy it. The American people will not allow that to happen.
Despite all of the evidence, Trump continues to be obsessed with the belief that there is massive voter fraud in this country. In 2017 after he won the presidency, Trump insisted that he would have won the popular vote, which he lost by three million votes if “millions of illegal votes had not been cast.” There is absolutely no evidence of that being true. In fact, it is totally preposterous to believe that millions of votes or any significant number of votes at all were cast illegally. This is an assertion supported by no one, not Democratic officials, not Republican officials, no one, and yet that is what Trump said after he won.
There have been numerous studies done on the issue of voter fraud in our country. They have all concluded essentially in the same way. Voter fraud in the United States of America is extremely rare. Our study by Dartmouth University found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. An article in the New York Times from December, 2016 stated and I quote, “In an election in which more than 137 million Americans cast ballots, election and law enforcement officials in 26 states and the District of Columbia, Democratic leaning, Republican leaning and in between said that so far, they knew of no credible allegations of fraudulent voting. Officials in another eight states said they knew of only one allegation. In Georgia, where more than 4 million people cast ballots, officials said they had open inquiries in 25 cases into “suspicious voting” or election related activity”. End of quote.
“But inquiries to all 50 states, every one but Kansas responded, found no states that reported indications of widespread fraud.” End of quote, New York Times. A report by the Brennan Center for Justice reviewed elections that had been meticulously studied for voter fraud and found incident rates between 0.0003% and 0.0025%. The report concluded that it is more likely that an American “will be struck by lightning than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls”. Even the conservative Heritage Foundation, which maintains the database on election fraud could only find 140…
… the database on election fraud could only find 143 criminal convictions of mail-in voter fraud out of 250 million mail-in votes cast over the past 20 years, a rate of 0.00006%.
But you don’t have to trust me on this issue. Benjamin Ginsburg, one of the leading Republican experts on election, a man who served as National Council to the Bush-Cheney presidential campaign, a man who played a major role for the Republican party in the 2000 Florida recounts, and who co-chaired the bi-partisan 2013 presidential commission on election administration, recently wrote in the Washington Post, and I quote, “The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there is no proof of widespread fraud. At most, there are isolated incidents by both Democrats and Republicans, elections are not rigged,” end of quote.
Let me repeat from one of the Republican parties, leading experts on elections, quote, “The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there’s no proof of widespread fraud. At most, there are isolated incidents by both Democrats and Republicans, elections are not rigged.”
And even if the statement of Mr. Ginsburg is not good enough for you, here is what the Trump administration’s own voting integrity commission reported. According to an analysis of administration documents by the Associated Press, Trump’s commission uncovered quote, “No evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud,” end quote, and they disbanded in 2018.
Even a Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, tamped down current concerns about mail-in ballots last month saying, and I quote, “Many parts of our country vote by mail. Oregon, Washington and Colorado have voted by mail for years,” end of quote.
And yet, we have a president today who calls mail-in ballots a hoax and a scam. Trump’s strategy to de- legitimized this election and to stay in office if he loses his not complicated. Finding himself behind in many polls, he is attempting massive voter suppression. He and his Republican colleagues are doing everything they can to make it harder and harder for people to vote.
In addition, he is sowing the seeds of chaos, confusion and conspiracy theories by casting doubt on the integrity of this election, and if he loses, justifying why he should remain in office. In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News, Trump refused to say that he would leave office if he lost. Asked to give a direct answer on whether he would accept the election results, Trump refused. He said, quote, “I have to see. No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say no. I didn’t last time either,” end of quote. That’s pretty much what he said yesterday.
In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump made clear that he wants to defund the postal service in order to limit the use of mail-in ballots. In an interview on August 13th, discussing a possible deal for a relief package that would have funded the United States Postal Service, Trump let the cat out of the bag by admitting that, quote, “If we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail- in voting. They just can’t have it,” end of quote.
In other words, what Donald Trump is saying to tens of millions of Americans is that at a time when over 200,000 of our people have already died from the coronavirus, you have a choice, you can either risk your health or even your life by walking into a voting booth, or you can’t vote. How outrageous, how disgraceful is that?
Amazingly, at the very same time, Trump is making completely baseless allegations about voter fraud. Last month, he urged the supporters of North Carolina to try voting twice, which among other things is a felony. In order to advance his plan for mass voter suppression, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Nevada, which fortunately was dismissed, challenging the state’s mail-in voting laws.
In July, trump used false claims of voter fraud to propose delaying this year’s election, which he obviously does not have the power to do. This was so outrageous that Steven Calabresi, the Co-Founder of the Conservative Federalist Society wrote that it was, quote, “Grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment, again, by the house of representatives and his removal from office by the Senate,” end of quote.
Last week, Trump told his supporters at a rally in Nevada, that he, quote, “Was entitled,” end quote, to serve a third term, which is obviously a violation of the constitution’s 22nd amendment.
On Saturday, Trump suggested to his supporters in North Carolina that he might sign an executive order to prevent Joe Biden from becoming president. Trump has also urged his supporters to become, quote, “Poll watches.” But what he is really saying is that he wants his supporters, some of whom are members of armed militias, to intimidate voters. We’re already seeing this in Virginia, where early voters were confronted by Trump supporters and election officials in Fairfax County said that some voters and polling staff felt intimidated.
On and on and on it goes. Every day, over and over again, Trump is making it harder for the American people to participate in the political process and is attempting to de legitimize the outcome of this election so that if he loses, he can remain in office.
The concerns that I am raising today on not just mine alone, and are not just concerns shared by Progressive’s or Democrats. Miles Taylor, a lifelong Republican who previously served as Chief of Staff inside the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security, on that there is nothing that Trump will not do or say to defeat Biden. This is what he said, and I quote, “Put nothing past Donald Trump,” Taylor told the AP, “He will do anything to win. If that means climbing over other people, climbing over his own people or climbing over US law, he will do it. People are right to be concerned,” end of quote.
Well, I agree with Mr. Taylor. I am concerned and I am very concerned. Last week, my former Senate colleague, Dan Coats, Trump’s own former Director of National Intelligence published a piece in the New York Times, calling for a high level bipartisan and nonpartisan commission to oversee the election, to reassure all Americans that it has been carried out fairly.
Coats wrote, and I quote, “The most urgent task American leaders face is to ensure that the election results are accepted as legitimate. Electoral legitimacy is the essential linchpin of our entire political culture. We should see the challenge clearly in advance and take immediate action to respond,” end of quote. That’s Dan Coats, former Intelligence Director of Donald Trump. I couldn’t agree more. I strongly second Director Coats’ call for this election commission.
Last week as well, Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer and I sent a letter to Senator McConnell, urging him to hold hearings on the issue of election and post-election security. Senator Schumer and I stated, quote, “We would like to hear from the most knowledgeable people in the country as to how we can do everything possible to make sure that the election and the period afterward is secure and peaceful,” end quote. Majority leader McConnell, please respond to that letter …
… Leader McConnell, please respond to that letter. Please establish that bi-partisan committee. And today I call on every elected official in America, whether they be Republican, Democrat or Independent to vigorously oppose voter suppression and voter intimidation to make sure that every vote is counted and that no one is declared the winner until those votes are counted. And to my Republican colleagues in the Congress, please do not continue to tell the American people how much you love America, if at this critical moment you are not prepared to stand up to defend American democracy and our way of life. Stop the hypocrisy.
Now with or without Donald Trump this election is unique in American history because it is taking place during a pandemic and a public health crisis. As a result, states all over America are taking the appropriate steps to ensure more Americans can safely vote by mail in their own homes instead of risking their health or their lives to vote in person. The result is that this election will see by far the largest number of mail-in ballots ever.
And let’s be clear. Despite what Donald Trump says, voting by mail is not a new or dangerous idea. Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah conduct their elections almost entirely by mail. California, Nevada, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, my own state of Vermont, have pledged to mail ballots to all registered voters for the upcoming election. And many other states are making it easier, obvious reasons, to vote by mail. Trump himself, as well as members of his administration, have repeatedly voted by mail. Members of the United States military have regularly voted by mail since the 1800s.
Given the significant increase in mail-in ballots why you might ask are Trump and his allies trying to attack the integrity of our vote by mail system. And the answer is pretty simple. A number of studies have shown that for whatever reasons, Republicans are more likely to vote in person while Democrats are more likely to use mail-in ballots. In fact one poll found that only about a quarter of Biden supporters would vote in person on election day while some two-thirds of Trump voters plan to vote in person.
In other words, if Trump can undermine people’s confidence in the validity of votes cast by mail he will be calling into questions the validity of votes that may overwhelmingly support Joe Biden. Let us consider the following scenario, a scenario which I hope very much never takes place.
On election night Trump is ahead in many battleground states based on the votes of those who voted in person on election day. All across the television screens people see Trump ahead before they turn in for the night. But as more and more mail-in ballots are counted Trump’s lead folds. Trump then announces with no proof that there has been massive mail-in ballot fraud and that these votes should not be counted and that he has won the election. In other words, Trump may well announce that he has won the election before all of the votes are counted and that large numbers of mail-in ballots should be discarded.
Furthermore, in states where Republicans control the legislature, it is possible that the election results will be ignored because of false accusations of voter fraud, and that the legislature itself will use its power to appoint electors pledged to vote for Trump, overriding the will of the people. And in the midst of all of this with the death of Justice Ginsburg, Trump is attempting to push through a Supreme Court Justice who may very well cast a vote in a case that will determine the outcome of this election. He is doing that at a time when early voting has already begun and millions of ballots will have already been cast.
In this unprecedented moment what can we as a people do in the struggle to preserve American democracy? First, it is absolutely imperative that we have by far, the largest voter turnout in American history, and that people vote as early as possible. As someone who’s strongly supporting Joe Biden, let’s be clear, a landslide victory for Biden will make it virtually impossible for Trump to deny the results and is our best means for defending democracy.
Second, with the pandemic and a massive increase in mail-in voting state legislatures must take immediate action now, now, to allow mail-in votes to be counted before election day as they come in. In fact, 32 states allow for the counting or processing of absentee ballots, verifying signatures, for example, before election day. All states should do the same. The faster all ballots are counted the less window there is for chaos and conspiracy theories.
Third, the news media needs to prepare the American people to understand there is no longer a single election day, and that it is very possible that we may not know the results on November 3rd.
Fourth, social media companies must finally get their act together and stop people from using their tools to spread disinformation and to threaten and harass election officials.
Fifth, in the Congress and in state legislatures hearings must be held as possible to explain to the public how the election day process and the days that follow will be handled. As we count every vote and prevent voter intimidation everything possible must be done to prevent chaos, disinformation, and yes, even violence.
Lastly, and most importantly, the American people no matter what their political view, must make it clear that American democracy will not be destroyed. Our country from its inception, and through the sacrifices of millions, has been a model to the world with regard to representative government. In 1863 in the midst of the terrible Civil War, Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg stated that this government “of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” That was true then. That is true today. Regardless of what Donald Trump wants the American people will preserve democracy in our country.
Thank you all very much.
",Bernie Sanders Speech Transcript: ‘Trump’s Threat to Our Democracy’,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/bernie-sanders-speech-transcript-trumps-threat-to-our-democracy
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-06-27,"Well, I thought I'd ask you folks to come say hello, and we'll discuss healthcare. We have really no choice but to solve this situation. Obamacare is a total disaster.
It's melting down as we speak. Rates are going up. In fact, it's very interesting, Lisa, that you're sitting next to me because, in Alaska, it was 206 percent -- a 206 percent increase in Alaska. And I used to use Arizona as the standard; that was 116 percent. So it's really meltdown, and we're going to try and solve the problem.
So I invited all of you, and I think we have either 52 out of 52, or 50 out of 52. And John, either one is pretty good, I think, as a percentage.
So we're going to talk and we're going to see what we can do. We're getting very close. But for the country, we have to have healthcare. And it can't be Obamacare, which is melting down. The other side is saying all sorts of things before they even knew what the bill was. This will be great if we get it done. And if we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like. And that's okay, and I understand that very well.
But I think we have a chance to do something very, very important for the public -- very, very important for the people of our country that we love.
So I'll ask the press to leave. I greatly appreciate you folks being here. We love you very much. You're very kind and very understanding. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
I think the Senate bill is going to be great. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Such an understanding lot.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Meets With Senators On Healthcare,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-senators-healthcare-june-27-2017
Oliver Dowden,United Kingdom,2019-02-25,"Thank you for that kind welcome. It is a pleasure to be here at the CBI and to see so many familiar faces. I’ve certainly made it a priority to engage around this agenda and there is a lot of work we can do together, particularly around innovation and the transformation of public services, which is another interest of mine.
This morning I am here to detail how this government is working alongside industry leaders like yourselves to ensure citizens are benefitting from the delivery of better, smarter and more efficient public services.
Now, as you all know, the collapse of Carillion just over a year ago affected the public’s trust in government’s ability to deliver services. As a result, it is right that we reflected on whether our service delivery model was fit for the complexities of modern society.
And over the last eight months the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, and myself have announced reforms to ensure that the way we outsource services is fit for the future.
This model rightly includes putting social values at the heart of what we do.
And the public would expect nothing less.
Since David last spoke on this issue in November 2018, the Government Commercial Function has worked jointly with industry and senior officials across government, as well as engaging with charities, social enterprises, unions and has finalised the review of our outsourcing processes.
And crucially, this review has concluded that we are not seeking to abandon our approach to using the private sector to deliver services to government.
Outsourcing, done well, I firmly believe, can deliver significant benefits.
It provides greater opportunity, better value and more innovative public services.
Economies of scale mean services can be provided more efficiently, at lower cost and can provide better value for the taxpayer.
For example, pensions administration for nearly two million teachers has been outsourced since the 1990s – with administrative costs less than half those of other comparable schemes.
So the evidence is out there in terms of individual outsourcing programmes but also in terms of the macro picture.
Research commissioned by the previous government has shown that outsourcing delivers savings of some twenty to thirty per cent compared with bringing services in-house.
Critics baulk at the idea of a government that reaches out beyond SW1 to harness the talent of firms up and down the country.
But we are not so naive to think that government is best placed to deliver every public service, nor do we think that we alone have all the solutions to society’s complex challenges.
While government has considerable resources at its disposal, it cannot do everything by itself. Different government projects require different skills and expertise.
It is true that collectively we need to work together to make those changes, but we must be bringing in that wider range of skills and expertise.
So we are making changes to enable our services to be delivered by private and social enterprises, small businesses, charities, mutuals and cooperatives. And as announced last June, the government is committed to putting social values at the heart of service delivery.
We are also making changes to ensure that critical services continue in the event of a corporate failure – and the work we have done over the past year provides that resilience.
We previously announced that in early 2019 we would be publishing guidance for officials that would help government to work smarter with industry, set up contracts for success and build a more diverse supplier base.
As promised, today we have published the Financial Distress Guidance to provide staff with the information they needed in the event of a supplier failure.
We have also published the Outsourcing Playbook, which we pledged back in June 2018 and which will apply to all government departments.
You may already be aware of some of the Playbook’s contents that we announced in November. But today I want to detail a further seven new measures that have been developed.
Taken together this means that from today, will be demanding more of government departments.
We will expect them to conduct more robust financial assessments and monitoring of high value, complex, high-risk suppliers.
New financial ratios will need to be considered when assessing the financial and economic standing of bidders during the procurement phase and through the life of a contract.
This step-change means that by undergoing an independent peer assessment ahead of the transition from policy to delivery, complex outsourcing projects will benefit from more cross-government expertise to help assure deliverability, affordability and value for money.
Departments will also be expected to conduct a more thorough, evidence-based ‘Make or Buy’ assessment before services are outsourced.
We will now expect a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of each option supported by the possible consequences of outsourcing and a comprehensive evaluation of risks.
And I am well aware that how government approaches risk allocation has caused some disquiet within the industry.
I can today provide reassurance that the Playbook makes explicit that when designing contracts departments must seek to mitigate, reduce and then allocate risks to the party best able to manage it.
A more considered approach to risk allocation makes government a smarter, more attractive client to do business with.
At the end of the day, you all run businesses, and my colleagues and I are constantly working to balance the needs of everyone in society, from firm owners and investors to families struggling to make ends meet.
So it is important that in this spirit the Playbook also outlines new guidance on the Pricing and Payment Mechanisms that complements the new balanced approach to risk allocation. It is designed to incentivise the behaviours and outcomes that government wants to achieve from its suppliers and contracts.
The Playbook also specifies that Departments will now regularly Publish Commercial Pipelines looking at least 18 months ahead.
This change will help us move forward by helping you gain a better understanding of the government’s demand for services and allow you to better respond to contract opportunities.
Finally, the Playbook will re-emphasise the need for departments to engage early and thoroughly with the Market and will ask them to produce a market health and capability assessment.
And these assessments will be kept under review throughout the life of a contract not filed away to gather dust in a digital desk drawer.
Taken together the eleven key policies that underpin the Playbook are a significant change in the way government undertakes outsourcing decisions and will enable us to make smarter outsourcing decisions that will achieve better value for money.
But to stress – the future of government outsourcing relies on a new model of reciprocity.
We are changing to ensure we make smarter outsourcing decisions, but we also need industry to change too.
In order to put the needs of service users at the heart of public service delivery I want to see suppliers and government working in partnership to ensure that contracts continue to meet the diverse needs of citizens.
So today I am publishing a revision to the Supplier Code of Conduct which sets out the behaviours taxpayers expect of central government’s suppliers but also what suppliers should expect of government. The Code is designed to build trusting and transparent relationships between government and suppliers.
The updated code highlights the importance of government departments creating the right conditions for innovation and the right conditions for building collaborative and constructive relationships.
I want to highlight three key aspects:
Firstly, the Code requires prime contractors to ensure that they do not pass on risk inappropriately to subcontractors, who are often small businesses unable to manage these risks.
Secondly, we want to ensure that suppliers across the public sector supply chain are paid promptly – this is so important, particularly for small suppliers. I announced in November that we expect suppliers to pay subcontractors within 30 days on public sector contracts and comply with the standards set out in the Prompt Payment Code on all other contracts. Failure of companies to demonstrate their prompt payment to suppliers could result in them being prevented from winning government contracts.
The government has a long-standing target of paying 80% of undisputed and valid invoices within five days, with the remainder paid within 30 days. And just last autumn, I announced our ambition to pay 90% of undisputed invoices within five days.
Thirdly, because we know the importance of robust data from government during procurements we will ensure that we provide data that captures the full scope of the services being procured or build in added flexibility to allow for subsequent validation of data, particularly where new services are being provided.
The Code is clear that we also expect incumbent suppliers to be forthcoming and prompt with information required for the re-tendering process.
Finally, I would like to update you on the government’s Strategic Supplier Risk Management Policy. Experience from the past year has demonstrated to us that how we manage risk with suppliers to government needs to be reviewed. A fact also recommended by the Public Accounts Committee.
Our previous high-risk designation process was designed to deal with poor performance but it proved less appropriate when managing the financial distress of firms who were delivering critical public services.
So today, I would like to announce that we will be changing our approach.
We will be introducing a Memorandum of Understanding between the Cabinet Office and Strategic Suppliers.
This new approach will provide flexibility to government on how it manages risk across its supplier base through the improvement of current tools, and this will be in partnership with industry.
Better risk management will increase accountability for our suppliers and enhance current departmental relationships.
Government relies on its suppliers for the delivery of many important public services and while this is underpinned by a contractual relationship, these reliances need to be based on a relationship of trust between government, suppliers and the public.
Healthy and competitive markets support our ability to achieve value for money for taxpayers and deliver sustainable economic growth.
And the collaboration with the private sector will continue to live at the heart of how this government delivers public services and prosperity.
In keeping with best practice in policy-making we will continue to review and refine our approach.
From the new financial year we will begin an 18 month implementation phase to ensure these new reforms are embedded across government departments.
I would like to thank you for your engagement and collaboration over the past year.
Between us, we have collectively contributed over 1,400 hours of our time.
And as we move into this next phase of work, we will continue to call on you both as partners and critical friends.
Because only in continuing to work together, and changing “poor” practices of the past, will we be able to achieve our collective goal of delivering world-class public services for all of our citizens.
",2019 Speech at CBI,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/oliver-dowden-2019-speech-at-cbi/
Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2008-02-03,"Good morning, George.
Well, I think that my record and the elections that I've been through demonstrate that I'm more likely, at the end of the day, to be able to attract voters who know how serious the issues are that we face, with a war to end in Iraq and a war to resolve in Afghanistan, an economy that is slipping into a recession and not working for most people.
And I think it's also clear that on issue after issue, I can draw a very stark contrast with Senator McCain, if he happens to be the nominee. Take health care. I intend to go into the general election standing for a core Democratic value and, frankly, a moral principle to me, and that is universal health care, everyone covered, no exceptions, no excuses.
And, finally, as you know, George, I've been taking the incoming fire from Republicans for about 16 years now, and I'm still here, because I have been vetted, I have been tested.
There's unlikely to be any new surprises. People understand who I am, where I'm from, what I do, what I believe in. And I think that I can go up against Senator McCain or any of the Republicans and be able to defend our positions, put them forward to the American people and make an affirmative case as to why I should be the president.
Well, I think it's fair to say, George, that it's not so much about him as it is about me, that, you know, I have been through these Republican attacks over and over and over again, and I believe that I've demonstrated that, much to the dismay of the Republicans, I not only can survive, but thrive.
I think that's a very important difference to take into this election, because you know well, as I do, that the Republicans are not going to go quietly away. They want to win, obviously. They want to keep the White House. They'll run a very vigorous campaign. They will end up being united, as we will.
And then it will be two people on the stage talking about who can protect and defend our country, who can restore our leadership and moral authority around the world, and who can actually produce results for the American people.
That's what I will be talking about. And I think I have a very good chance of being able to make that case and withstand whatever comes my way.
I know people look at this campaign and say, ""Well, you know, somebody said this and somebody said that,"" but by all accounts, there haven't been the kind of attack ads that you're going to see in the general election.
There haven't been the tens of millions of dollars spent against either of us that will definitely come our way. I do have some Republicans who are already working against me. There's some gentleman in Texas, who seems quite determined to run robo-calls and the like, but people brush that off.
So we've had a campaign that has been an incredible experience personally for me and I think for all of the candidates. And, truly, whoever is our nominee will be making history by the very fact of becoming the nominee.
But I think that's when the hard work starts. You know, general elections are much more contested. The other side has no compunction about raising any issue against whomever they're running against, and we haven't seen that tested and vetted experience in this primary.
And, frankly, you know, in his prior election in Illinois, Senator Obama didn't face anyone who ran attack ads against him. He ran against a very weak opponent, without resources or credibility.
So I believe that this will be a very tough fought general election.
Well, I think elections are about the future, and what voters are going to be thinking about is who can best get us out of Iraq, who can do it in the most responsible and careful way, who will have the credibility, the strength and the experience to convey to the rest of the world that we are undoing this disastrous policy, but you better not in any way doubt America's resolve to protect and defend ourselves here at home and around the world.
And I think the contrast between me and Senator McCain could not be stronger. He wants to be there for 100 years. It would be fine with him, he said. You know, if I don't start getting our troops outwithin 60 days, you'll be surprised, because that's what I intend to do.
So get them out within 60 days, begin that process, OK to stay 100 years. I think voters will see a very stark contrast.
And I want to say something else. You know, Senator Obama consistently misstates what I had said and really tries to gloss over his answer to a question in an early debate.
The question was very specific -- would you, without preconditions, meet with five of the worst dictators, including Ahmadinejad from Iran and others, without preconditions, personally, as president? He said yes. I said no.
That has nothing to do with whether or not we would havediplomatic efforts with all of the countries. I've been a longtime advocate of having diplomatic processes with Iran and Syria.
I think it's imperative.
Absolutely.
Well, with Iran and Syria, most certainly. I have said that. But it would be at low level diplomatic efforts, between our ambassadors and between our diplomats, because I don't think a president should put the prestige of the United States on the line to meet with these people unless you have some idea of what is going to happen.
And I'm always a little amused when Senator Obama goes around quoting President Kennedy, when he was running for the presidency, about how you should never be afraid to negotiate.
But then if you look at the actual transcript of what President Kennedy said in the debates with Vice President Nixon, he said he would not meet with Khrushchev unless there had been a lot of groundwork laid.
That is the appropriate position for the president of the UnitedStates to take. And so, I really hope that Senator Obama will quit deliberately misstating what I said in order to avoid scrutiny for what he says.
George, let's put this in context, because this is a big difference between us. I think universal health care is a core Democratic value and a moral principle, and I'm absolutely going to doeverything I can to achieve that.
You know, if you look at my plan, it's a misstatement to say that people won't be able to afford it, because I have a very detailed approach about giving people health care tax credits,limiting -- I'm the only person who does -- limiting the percentage of what you would have to pay for a premium to a low percent of yourincome.
This plan has been examined by independent experts, and they agree with me, just as they agreed with Senator Edwards, as well, that if you do not start with a plan that attempts to achieve universal health care, you will not get there.
The insurance companies will continue to cherry-pick. The emergency rooms will be crowded. And once again, we will slide into the morass we're in now, where more and more people are uninsured and we don't get the quality outcomes that we should.
With respect to how do you get people to do it, I find this somewhat bewildering. Senator Obama has a mandate. He has a mandate on children. He has talked a lot about requiring people, if they show up to get some kind of health care, like in the emergency room, and they don't have health insurance, hitting them right then to make sure that they get some kind of health insurance.
Well, I don't think you should wait until someone's in distress or sick. I think you should look to sign people up when they come into contact with the health-care system or government agencies.
About 20 percent of the people who don't have health insurance in America today could well afford it, even at the cost that it is, which is exorbitant. So what we've got to do is have shared responsibility. Everybody has to pay something, but, obviously, on a sliding scale.
That's why my health care tax credit...
... and the premium cap will work.
That's right.
Well, they don't have to pay fines, George. We want them to have insurance. We want it to be affordable.
And what I have said is that there are a number of ways of doingthat. Now, there's not just one way of getting to that.
I think you can automatically enroll people, and you will then say you've got to be part of this. It's what Senator Obama does for children. Clearly, he has a mandate, and he has a means of enforcing it or at least it appears he does.
And what I have learned over the last many years is that I'm sure the Congress has some ideas about this. But if you don't start with universal health care, if you don't say everybody's going to be in the system, we'll never get there.
And if you look at some of the misleading mailings that Senator Obama is sending out around the country, honest to goodness, it looks like it was written by the health-insurance companies.
It's so reminiscent of old ""Harry and Louise"" talking about how, oh, the sky will fall if we try to have universal health care.
He's playing right in to all of the arguments against this core value of the Democratic Party.
I will stand on the stage with John McCain and engage in that debate. Why would we want a nominee who leaves people out? And Senator McCain will say, well, I've got a plan and, yes, it leaves people out. So we're even.
That is not the kind of contrast we should be drawing going into this general election.
George, we will have an enforcement mechanism. Whether it's that or it's some other mechanism through the tax system or automatic enrollments.
But you're missing, I believe, the key point. If you don't start with universal health care, and I have very aggressive cost controls and quality improvements, and my health care tax credits plus the premium cap that I am the only person to put in to a health care plan to say, your income will be adjusted so that a small percentage will be always the limit of what you have to pay for premiums.
If you don't do what I am saying we do, we will never even attempt to get to universal health care. And the reason why I think there are a number of mechanisms, going after people's wages, automatic enrollment, when you are at the place of employment, you will be automatically enrolled, whatever the mechanism is is not as important as, number one, the fundamental commitment to universal health care, the appreciation that, with health care tax credits and with a premium cap, it will be affordable for everyone.
And the misleading information that Senator Obama's campaign is putting out, that I will force people to do it even if they can't afford it, is absolutely untrue.
CLINTON: There will be mechanisms to enable everyone to afford it. We have costed this out, and we will be able to achieve it.
So isn't it better that we start with a system that gets everybody in than starting with a plan that leaves 15 million people out to start, which will only get bigger and bigger as time goes on?
No, because I think I have the right position. I think this is a diversion from what has to be comprehensive immigration reform. And I think, again, it is not a fair statement.
You know, I attempted to support my governor as he tried to do something that is, admittedly, controversial, but I said at the time it was not something that I supported.
When that didn't work, it was very clear that, you know, my position has been consistent. I don't think we should be giving driver's licenses to people who are not documented.
You put so many difficult obstacles in the way here. You're going to ask people in motor vehicle departments to basically overlook the immigration laws of America. You're going to ask people to turn a blind eye and accept this form of identification.
I think that is not the right way to go. I believe we should be putting as much pressure on comprehensive immigration reform as possible.
And my supporters in California and in New York and across the country, Latino and others, understand exactly why this is the position we should be taking. And I intend to push for comprehensive immigration reform upon taking office as president.
Well, that this will be an interesting election, all the way through, George. You never know -- strange bedfellows and all of that.
But I honestly believe that it would be a tremendous contest between Senator McCain and myself. I think I can draw the contrasts and stand on that stage with him.
You know as well as I do that, at the end of every election, independent voters are often drawn back to a fundamental question: Who can protect and defend the United States of America?
And although security is not foremost on the agenda, there is no predicting what the agenda will look like come next fall.
And I believe that I am much better positioned, by record and experience, by the values and the opinions that I've expressed in this campaign, to go one-on-one with John McCain.
And, you know, at some point, I'm happy to have any voters, although this one took me somewhat by surprise.
Good to talk to you.
","Interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News' ""This Week""",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-george-stephanopoulos-abc-news-this-week-6
Damian Hinds,United Kingdom,2018-10-03,"Good afternoon everyone and thank you James for that introduction. James said a good education can do amazing things, and I certainly agree with that sentiment.
You know whenever I ask anyone to think back to their education, what really made a difference for them when they were at school, you know I have yet to come back – to get the answer back – “it was a smart board” or “a text book” or “an exam” or “a scheme of work”. The answer that comes back is always about a person. People talk about Miss Smith, Mr Jones, Mrs O’Neil. Because education is all about that person standing at the front of the class. Those inspiring individuals, those 450,000 teachers that we have out there, they deserve and they have our admiration, our respect and our thanks.
And you know since 2010, those teachers have made some amazing things happen. Assisted by the reforms initiated by my predecessors, by Nicky Morgan, Justine Greening and of course Michael Gove. We are back in the international top ten for primary reading. We have a reformed curriculum and examinations. We have thousands of schools that have been set free as academies. We’ve got 1.9 million more young people studying in good or outstanding schools. And the gap has been narrowed. The gap between the rich and the poor in attainment has narrowed at every stage and every phase from nursery school to university entry.
Now, that is a record of which you can be proud. You should be proud. But you shouldn’t be satisfied. We should not be satisfied until we can say that we truly have a world class education for everyone. Wherever they come from, wherever they’re going and whatever route they’re taking through our education system. Until we have made sure that in every region and in every group of our society, opportunity is truly equal.
And of course a world class education depends on our investment in the future. I say investment, because education spending isn’t just public spending. It is an investment. An investment in the future of those children going through our schools. Also an investment in the future of our country. And as you can see, we are strong investors in education when you look at us compared to other key comparator nations like the G7.
We have also been investing heavily in the capacity of our system to ensure we have a good supply of good and outstanding places in our schools. In contrast to Labour, who cut 100,000 places in our school system in the years running up to 2010, by the end of this decade, we will have added a million school places to our system. And we think that when a school is a good school, when it’s giving a good education, and when it’s popular with parents, that school should be able to expand so that more young people can benefit from what’s on offer. That includes if it is a grammar school. And we also believe that there is and always has been a very important role in our system for faith schools and we will continue to invest in free schools that have brought such diversity and innovation to our system and I was proud to see another 53 free schools opening this term for the new academic year as well as the hundreds already open.
I can see in the front row and – just give me a moment to introduce and to thank them – the brilliant DfE ministerial team, starting with Nick Gibb who has been there from the very start and has done so much to drive academic standards in our schools, and particularly the focus on early reading and phonics. Anne Milton with her infectious dedication to building up the skills base in our country, to apprenticeships and to colleges. Sam Gyimah, working alongside our excellent higher education sector and being such an effective voice for the student. Nadhim Zahawi, looking after early years and special needs and how we look after those children who are the most vulnerable in our society, those who are in care. And Lord Agnew, our minister in the Lords, who has brought his own expertise from a leading multi- academy trust to his role as Minister for the school system. We are also very lucky to be supported in Parliament by our team of David Morris, Jack Brereton, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, our Commons Whip Amanda Milling and James Younger in the Lords.
Now, we are all spurred on by three key imperatives. The first is progress. Because we think and I know you think that it is self-evident that every generation should have better opportunities than the last. And you think that every year we need to raise our sights higher and we need to reach wider to make sure we unlock the talent and potential in every child in our country.
Secondly, we know that on the education of this generation of children lies the future prospects and prosperity of our country. Because it’s productivity growth that allows people to be paid a little bit more each year and allows us to afford more for the excellent public services which we all value so much.
Third, preparedness: being ready for whatever comes in an uncertain world. Part of this is about being ready to seize the opportunities that will come in global trade after we leave the European Union. But it is also about preparedness for the change that’s happening in the world as we speak. If you think about the technological advances that are happening at the moment. If you think about artificial intelligence, voice computing, the internet, advanced robotics. Any of these on their own could constitute a revolution. But right now they are happening all at the same time. And so we’ve got a pace of change that is truly unprecedented. Now, people sometimes talk about all this technological change in the world as a threat and something to be overcome and there are issues to deal with. But it is an opportunity for those who are ready, those who are equipped to take advantage of this change and we need to make sure that this country is one of the countries that seizes technology and makes it work for us, not one of the countries that technological change gets done to.
So to deal with these challenges, to take the maximum advantage of these opportunities, now more than ever before, we need a focused and sustained plan for education and skills.
That starts with academic standards. And the way that the knowledge economy has developed and with the emerging superpowers of the economies of the east, we can’t afford any let up on academic standards and we need to go further and we need to make sure we are putting enough emphasis on the subjects of future, for the global Britain of the future in this changed world. So we need to think about the languages of mankind and the languages of machines.
We also need to make sure that all our young people leave our education system with the basic essential skills that they’re going to need with them in life whatever path they end up taking, whatever job they ends up doing. Central to that is English and Maths. We have made a lot of progress on English and Maths. But we need to go further. Today, I’m announcing 32 primary schools and 21 colleges which will act as centres of excellence to spread best practice respectively for early literacy teaching and the teaching of Maths aged 16 and above.
We also know and any teacher will tell you that good teaching and learning relies on a calm classroom. Pupil behaviour is absolutely essential. And so I’m also announcing today a further £10 million to support the spreading of best practice and knowledge on behaviour management and classroom management so that can be very widely deployed.
Now, I think we can say that there are genuinely large parts of our academic system which are truly word class. Many of our state schools, large parts of our university sector, are world class but there is another area which in years gone by has not had enough focus. I’m talking about technical and vocational education, which for decades has not had as much attention as it should. We have already made great strides forwards increasing the quality level of apprenticeships and with more people starting on higher level apprenticeships and even degree level apprenticeships.
You will have heard the announcement yesterday that we’re going to accelerate the process of moving on to these higher standards, employer-set apprenticeships that young people benefit from so much.
You have all heard of A Levels right? Tell me yes. You’ve all heard of A Levels but you may not yet have heard of T Levels? Who has heard of T Levels? Good, well those of you who haven’t yet, you will do soon, because within a couple of years we are bringing in this new qualification for 16 to 18 year olds called the T Level. It will be a direct alternative to A Levels, but focused on those key vocational subjects. Today I’m announcing a £38 million capital pot to make sure that the colleges teaching those first T Levels from 2020 can do so with really world class equipment and facilities.
And you also know how important careers advice is and guidance for young people and the key role that is played by careers advisers in schools, and so we are also going to be doubling the number of trained careers leaders in schools so young people are aware about all those different routes. So they don’t think there is only one route they can take to success and they are aware of all the different career options available to them.
We are also going to be reviewing the higher level qualifications, those at so-called level four and level five, that are the direct alternative to going to university for young people at 18, and we carry on our design work on the national retraining scheme, so that all throughout their lives people have the opportunity to upgrade and change their skills, so that lifelong learning stops being a phrase and starts being a reality.
Now, qualifications are clearly an absolutely essential part of education. They are, if you like, the paper passports that you leave school or college or university with, and take with you into your career and into your life. But they are not the whole of the story, and I invite you now to think back to the kids you were at school, and see if you can remember one that left school with nothing or next to nothing, by way of GCSEs or possibly, in some cases, O levels, depending on our age. Someone who came away with almost nothing in qualifications, but they still went on and did something really quite amazing in life. Can anyone think of that person? I am going to suggest to you that quite often what makes the difference is something that we might call character. Something that you will never see on a certificate of education, but you know it when you see it. I mean things like determination and drive. I mean the tenacity to stick with the task at hand, and the ability to bounce back from the knocks that life inevitably brings. Now these character traits are closely connected with something I hear all the time about from employers. So-called workplace skills. Things like teamwork. Commitment. The ability to look at the customer in the eye, and want to make the sale. Character is also connected to general health and well-being, and we are much more aware of this area, and rightly so, in the education sector now than in decades gone by. That’s why I am pleased that we are going to be introducing mental health education into schools within the next couple of years.
Now actually, I don’t think you can just walk into a class of 28 kids one day and say today, we are going to learn about character. Today we are going to do drive and determination. Of course you can’t, but these are things you pick up a lot from what happens at school, and in particular, I think, extracurricular activities play an important part. So I’m going to be working closely with Jeremy Wright on the new youth performance partnerships, and working with Gavin Williamson to make sure that more young people can get involved with the cadets. And for many young people, it is sport that really unlocks their talents and potential. In the last few years, we have been able to commit, to vote over £900 million to the primary sports premium. And now, working together with Tracy Crouch, the Sports Minister, we are going to be bringing in a new cross Government initiative for a school sports action plan, to make sure that sporting opportunities, and we will do this together with bodies like the RFU, with the Premier League, and with England netball, making sure that those opportunities are spread as widely as possible and that every child is able to benefit from what sports can bring.
Ladies and gentlemen, like many of you, I have been coming to this conference for many years, and in all those years that I have been coming, as a YC, an activist, a Parliamentary candidate and more recently as an MP, I think around the corridors and conference centres like this, and around the fringe events, and the cafes and the bars, I think I have heard more conversations about education than I have about anything else, because we Conservatives know that education is the key to the future.
It was the first One Nation Conservative, the original, Benjamin Disraeli who said, “Upon the education of the people of this country, the fate of this country depends.” Since then, it has been Conservatives who have most resolutely acted upon that. From Balfour to Butler, from Baker to Gove.
But you know as we stand here today in 2018, we can’t take for granted what has been achieved since 2010. Because we learnt from Liverpool last week, that the Labour Party wants to put it all at risk. They want to undo our reforms and turn back the clock. I was thinking about what a parent would think as they heard the speech of the Shadow Education Secretary, when she said she wanted to take all publicly funded schools back into Council control, back into what she called the ‘mainstream public sector’ with what she called a ‘common rule book’. Well you know, for a parent whose child has been thriving at a free school or an academy, how they must have shuddered when they heard those words. But ladies and gentleman, we will stand up for those families, we will defend the right for those children to have an outstanding education, because while Labour go off on their ideological journeys, that child only has one chance at their education and they deserve the very best.
So far from going backwards, ladies and gentleman, we need to move forwards with our reforms. We need to ensure that the vocational and the technical, are absolutely on a par with the academic. We need to make sure that we extend our reforms in all regions, in all parts of the country. That all parts of our society have equal opportunity, that everywhere we see raised expectations and raised aspirations, and when that happens, then we will be able to say, this is a world class education for everyone. Thank you.
",2018 Speech at Conservative Party Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/damian-hinds-2018-speech-at-conservative-party-conference/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-03-16,"I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing. That looks very nice. That’s very good. I want to thank everybody for being here today. This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G seven, G seven nations and they really had a good meeting. I think it was a very, very productive meeting. I also spoke with our nation’s governors, and this afternoon we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus. We did this today. This was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom were standing with me, and that’s available.
Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes. It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way. We especially worry about our senior citizens. The White House task force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast evolving situation that this has become all over the world. It’s all over the world. It’s incredible what’s happened in such a short period of time. On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx and our consultation with governors, we’ve made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it and that’s what we are. Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people.
Avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts. If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly and a lot of progress has been made. I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history, not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments and we’ve had some promising results, early results, but promising to reduce the severity and the duration of the symptoms. And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes we’re doing, and we’re doing it in every way. And with that I’d like to just introduce Dr. Birx, Who’s going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend. Thank you.
Okay, go ahead.
My favorite question, I ask it all the time, how many times Anthony? I think I ask him that question every day and I speak to Debra, I speak to a lot of them. I get the opinion. So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is a much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August, something like that. So it could be right in that period of time where I say it washes through, other people don’t like that term, but it washes through.
We’ll see what happens. But they think August, could be July. It could be longer than that. But I’ve asked that question many, many times. Yes?
I think they are very scared. I think they see that we’re doing a very professional job. We’ve been working with the governors and the frankly, the mayors, local government at every level. We have FEMA totally involved. FEMA has been … Usually we see FEMA for the hurricanes and the tornadoes. Now we have FEMA involved in this. They’ve been doing a fantastic job locally, working with people that they know because they work, like as an example, in California, in the state of Washington, they work with them a lot on other things and they’re very familiar, so they’re working on it. What you can do and all you can do is professional, totally competent. We have the best people in the world. We have really the greatest experts in the world and someday soon hopefully it’ll end and we’ll be back to where it was, but this came up … We came up so suddenly look, you were surprised. We were all surprised. We heard about it.
We heard about reports from China that something was happening and all of a sudden we did make a good decision. We closed our borders to China very quickly, very rapidly. That was … Otherwise we’d be in a very, as Tony has said numerous times, we’d be in a very bad position, much worse than we would be right now. You’re looking at what’s happening in other countries. Italy is having a very hard time, but I think that what we do, and I’ve spoken actually with my son, he says, “How bad is this?” It’s bad. It’s bad, but we’re going to, we’re going to be hopefully a case not a worst case and that’s what we’re working for. Yes?
Well, we have that very much. Yeah, we have that very much and we are … We’ve been pretty aggressive. We were early with Europe but we were very, very early with China and other places and fortunately we were. And as far as containment here, we are. We’re coming out with strong suggestions and it’s becoming a little bit automatic. You look at people, they’re not doing certain things. For instance, obviously not … I wouldn’t say the restaurant business is booming and bars and grills and all. People are self- containing for to a large extent. We look forward to the day when we can get back to normal. What’s your second question?
At this point, not nationwide, but, well, there was some point … Some places in our nation that are not very effected at all, but we may look at certain areas, certain hotspots, as they call them. We’ll be looking at that, but at this moment, no, we’re not.
… call them. We’ll be looking at that. But at this moment, no, we’re not.
I had my test. It was late Friday night. The reason I did it was because the … I had no symptoms whatsoever. The doctor said, “You have no symptoms so we don’t see any reason.” But when I did the press conference on Friday, everybody was going crazy. “Did you do the test? Did you do the test?” Very late on Friday night I did the test. The doctor may have put out something. I don’t know what time the letter went out. Maybe it was put out by somebody else, but the results came back I believe the following day. We tested negative.
I told them that and I went totally by what they said, the doctors, more than one. They said you don’t have any of the symptoms. They checked what you’re supposed to check and that I didn’t have symptoms, but I did a test late on Friday night. It came back probably 24 hours later or something. They sent it to the labs. It came back later. Yeah, please.
If they can get them faster by getting them on their own, in other words, go through a supply chain that they may have. Because the governors during normal times, the governors buy a lot of things, not necessarily through federal government. If they’re able to get ventilators, respirators, if they’re able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government.
We have stockpiles now where we’re ordering tremendous numbers of ventilators, respirators, masks, and they’re ordered. They’re coming. We have quite a few at this point. I think, Mike, we have a lot. But if they can get them directly, it’s always going to be faster if they could get them directly if they need them. I’ve given them authorization to order directly.
That’s right.
First of all, we hope we don’t get there. That’s what we’re doing. That’s why we’re taking a very strict look at this. But we also are looking at areas and not only looking, we’re expanding certain areas. We’re taking over buildings that aren’t used. We’re doing a lot in that regard. We hope we don’t have to get there, but we are doing a lot in that regard.
We’re looking at that and we may be expanding that. We are looking at that.
We want fairness. We want it for everybody. No, we’re looking at that through the Senate, because as you know the Senate is now digesting that bill.
We may very well be adding something on that. Good question.
I could get back to you with that number. We’ve ordered a lot. We have quite a few, but it may not be enough. If it’s not enough, we will have it by the time we need it. Hopefully we won’t need them.
Yeah, we’ll be able to give you-
We can give you a number. If it’s important, we’ll give you a number. Go ahead.
When I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with. We’re doing a very good job. There’s been a tremendous amount of the way they’re working together. They’re working hand-in-hand. I think they’re doing really a great job. From that standpoint, that’s what I was referring to yesterday. Yeah, Steve, go ahead.
I’m not referring to it. Meaning the-
Yeah, if you’re talking about the virus, no. That’s not under control for any place in the world. I think I read-
I think I read … no, I didn’t. I was talking about what we’re doing is under control, but I’m not talking about the virus.
Yes, please.
Well, it may be. We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus. Once we stop I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy. Once this goes away, once it goes through and we’re done with it, I think you’re going to see a tremendous, a tremendous surge.
We’re not really. We hope we don’t have to, Steve. We think that hopefully we won’t have to do that. But it’s certainly something that we talk about every day. We haven’t made that decision.
I think the federal government’s doing everything that we can possibly do. We made some very good early decisions by keeping people out, by keeping countries out, certain countries where the infection was very immense. I noticed a lot of people are talking about South Korea because they’ve a good job on one side, but on the other side, tremendous problems at the beginning. They had tremendous problems and great numbers of death. I think that we’ve done a fantastic job from just about every standpoint.
With that being said, no matter where you look, this is something. It’s an invisible enemy. But we are speaking all the time, not only with the people, but also the professional people, the nurses, the doctors, they have been doing a fantastic job. We are also working very much on getting them the kind of equipment that they need. For the most part, they either have it or they will be getting it.
But remember this, we want the governors, we want the mayors, we want them locally, from a local standpoint because it can go quicker, we want them to work. We had a great talk with the governors today. I think it was a really great talk. There’s a tremendous coordination. There’s a tremendous spirit that we have together with the governors. That’s pretty much for the most part, bipartisan. Yeah.
I don’t number one determine recession. I just say this. We have an invisible enemy. We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about. I’ve read about it. I read about many years ago, 1917, 1918. I’ve seen all of the different problems similar to this that we’ve had. This is a bad one. This is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it’s so contagious. It’s just so contagious, sort of a record setting-type contagion. The good part is the young people they do very well and healthy people do very well. Very, very bad for older people, especially older people with problems. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place. Yes, please.
I’ve been watching.
I don’t know. That I can’t tell you if they are or not. I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair. I think people are pulling together on this. I really think the media has been very fair. I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games, but it doesn’t matter. We haven’t really determined to do that at all and hopefully we won’t have to. That’s a very big step. It’s a step we can take, but we have not decided to do it. Jennifer, go.
I’ve heard that’s true. I don’t know that for a fact, but I know that some of my people have, as I understand it, have been dealing with them or with him. That’s nice. We’ve had tremendous support from a lot of people that can help. I believe he was one of them.
As far as the airlines are concerned, were going to back the airlines 100%. it’s not their fault. It’s nobody’s fault unless you go to the original source, but it’s nobody’s fault. We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much. We’ve told the airlines we’re going to help them.
We’re going to be helping. We’re going to be backstopping the airlines. We’re going to be helping them very much, John. It’s very important.
We’re going to be looking at it very strongly. We have to back the airlines. It’s not their fault. In fact, they were having a record season. Everybody was. They were having record seasons. Then this came out and it came out from nowhere. Not their fault, but we’re going to be back the airline. Yeah.
Best thing I can do for the stock market is we have to get through this crisis. That’s what I can do. That’s the best thing we can do. That’s what I think about. Once this virus has gone, I think you’re going to have a stock market like nobody’s ever seen before.
Oh, okay.
Yeah. That would be the outside number.
Hold on one second. Please, go ahead.
I think they may make it even better. Look, they’re working together very well with the House. They are working very much in unison, like the question before. They’re working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody. That’s what we’re looking to do. We may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion. Please.
Let me just have the professionals answer that. Would you like to do that? Please.
Go ahead, Yes, Mike.
Admiral, perhaps you could-
I think the admiral can answer that and you might want to talk about the roving also.
I think just to put it a different way, a lot of testing has been going on. I don’t believe anybody has been able to do what we’re doing and what we will be doing.
This has never been done before. That’s never been done and certainly not on a level like that. I will say that I think I can speak for the professionals that if you don’t have the symptoms, if your doctor doesn’t think you need it, don’t get the test. Don’t get the test. I think that’s very important. Not everybody should run out and get the test, but we’re able to handle tremendous numbers of people.
John?
We’re looking into it. We’ve heard that. We’ve heard it from really two places. There are two places that have specifically, New York being one. We are looking into it very strongly. Yeah.
Steve, go ahead please.
I’ve always washed my hands a lot. I wash my hands a lot. Maybe, if anything, more, certainly not less.
Not something I want to do every day. I can tell you that. It’s a little bit of … good doctors in the White House, but it’s a test. It’s a test. It’s a medical test. Nothing pleasant about it.
I think he can do more.
I think he can do more. It’s an area of the country that’s very hot right now. I think New Rochelle, a place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle.
Place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle. I think it’s a very, no I think it’s an area that has to be tamped down even more. Because it’s a hotbed. There’s no question about it. So I think they could look at doing it. But we’re getting along very well. We’ve had a very, in fact, I noticed he made some statements just now that the relationship with the federal government has been good. That federal government has done everything they’ve wanted us to do.
But we can, I think it’s very important that all of the governors get along very well with us. And that we get along with the governors and I think that’s happening.
Well, we haven’t thought of it. But you know, I will say this, we’re very careful. We’re very careful with being together. Even the people behind me they’ve been very strongly tested. I’ve been very strongly tested and we have to be very careful. But everybody should be very vigilant. We have to be vigilant. Yeah please.
Go ahead please.
Hold it, hold it. Before you.
I’d rate it a ten. I think we’ve done a great job. And it started with the fact that we kept a very highly infected country despite, even the professionals saying, “No, it’s too early to do that.” We were very, very early with respect to China. And we would have a whole different situation in this country. If we didn’t do that. I would rate ourselves and the professional. I think the professionals have done a fantastic job.
As far as the testing. You heard the Admiral, I think the testing that we’ve done. We really took over an obsolete system. Or put it maybe in a different way, a system that wasn’t meant to do anything like this. We took it over and we’re doing something that’s never been done in this country. And I think that we are doing very well. We took the system, we worked with the system we had and we broke down the system purposely. We broke it down in order to do what we’re doing now. And within a short period of time and even now we’re testing tremendous numbers of people. And ultimately you’re saying, it will be what? It will be up to how many people will be able to test?
Yeah, normally. But I think when you hear the, “This has never been done before in this country.” If you look back take a look at some of the things that took place in ’09 or ’11 or whatever it may have been nobody’s ever done anything like what we’re doing. Now. I will also say Admiral, I think we can say that we’re also getting this ready for the future. So that when we have a future problem, if and when, and hopefully we don’t have anything like this. But if there is, we’re going to be starting off from a much higher plateau. Because we were at a very, very low base. We had a system that was not meant for this. It was a smaller system. It was meant for a much different purpose and for that purpose it was fine. But not for this purpose. So we broke down the system and now we have something that’s going to be and is very special and is ready for future problems. I think we can say that very strongly. Yeah.
Go ahead please.
Well, I’d leave that up to the states. It’s a big thing. Postponing an election. I think to me that really goes to the heart of what we’re all about. I think postponing and elections is a very tough thing I know they’re doing, because they’ve been in touch with us, they’re doing it very carefully. They’re spreading people out at great distances as you can see. And I think they’ll do it very safely. I hope they do it very safely, but I think postponing elections is not a very good thing. They have lots of room and a lot of the electoral places. And I think that they will do it very well, but I think postponing is unnecessary.
We think about it. We think about it. If we don’t have to do it, that’ll be good. We have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the Southern and the Northern borders. And we are talking about different things, but we’ll see. Right now we have not decided to do that. Steve.
Go ahead please.
Yeah, no the marked will take care of itself. The market will be a very strong as soon as we get rid of the virus. Yes.
I haven’t heard that. I haven’t heard that from Devin or anybody else.
Well I have to see what they said. But-
Well, I would disagree with it. But right now we don’t have an order one way or the other. We don’t have an order, but I think it’s probably better that you don’t. Especially in certain areas, Oklahoma doesn’t have a tremendous problem. You said the Governor of Oklahoma?
And Devin.
Yeah, well I had heard that.
Yeah.
I’ll take a look at it. Absolutely.
Do you want to answer that?
Well we haven’t said that yet.
We’re recommending but-
… we’re recommending things. No, we haven’t gone to that step yet. That could happen, but we haven’t gone there yet. Please.
Well hopefully it will pas through and hopefully everybody will be going to restaurants and flying and being on cruise ships and all of these different things that we do. And it will very, very hopefully be at a fairly quick period of time. But we’re taking a tough stance. We may make certain other decisions, we may enhance those decisions. We’re going to find out as per the question that you were asking, some of those decisions may be hence. How about one more? Jennifer.
Yeah.
One thing Mike just said, it’s very important to get out that this is for the next, much of what we’re talking about is for the next 15 days. Mike go ahead.
Just one more. Steve go ahead please.
Yeah.
We had a G7.
It was-
It looks like it.
I am very confident. They’re in a position that some of them are in a rough position. If you look at a couple of them. And some are heading toward pretty rough territory. We had a very good a conference. It was a teleconference. Everybody was on the phone, every leader. And almost a hundred percent was devoted to the subject that we’re talking about today. And they are working very hard and they’re very concerned obviously, but they’re working very hard. But I would say just about all of it was Steve, all of it was devoted to what we’re talking about.
I think so. I mean so far it seems, we didn’t even discuss that. It’s still a ways off. But it was a very good discussion and there’s a great comradery. There’s a great togetherness. I think I can say that very, very strongly. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
",Donald Trump Coronavirus Task Force Update: March 16,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-task-force-update-march-16
Nancy Pelosi,United States of America,2020-09-24,"Good morning.
It’s the first time we’ve all been together since losing the notorious Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Such a sad passing for our country. My understanding from the Jewish faith is that when you leave on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, you are in a special category of the righteous. May she rest in peace. People ask me some stories about Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the rest, and one I want to tell you this morning is something that is remarkable. I mean, tomorrow we will be gathering in Statuary Hall, where she will be the first woman to lie in state in the capital of the United States. Actually, our prayer will be led by a rabbi, the first Jewish person to lie in state in the capital of the United States. So we have a lot of cause for, I don’t want to say celebration, but observance of a historic time for a historic woman. Did more for the equality of women than anybody in our history.
And a couple years ago we honored, in the capital, in Women’s History Month, the women members of the Supreme Court. Being the senior member, Justice Ginsburg spoke for the group to receive the honor. And she told the story of a woman named Belva Lockwood. Belva Lockwood is a New Yorker, Chuck Schumer keeps reminding me, Leader Schumer keeps reminding me. Belva Lockwood in 1876, long time ago, she applied to practice law in the Supreme Court. The vote against was 6-3. There were nine justices then, as now. 6-e. Because she was a woman, they turned her down. So she didn’t take no for an answer. She campaigned, advocated for change with the Congress of the United States. And she won. Congress passed a bill saying that women with the qualifications must be admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court.
And Ginsburg then goes on to say, “It is my favorite example of how sometimes the Congress is more in touch with changing times and expansion of idea of equality than the Court is.” I remind you that when the Court, in now current history, ruled against women in the workplace by ruling against in the Lilly Ledbetter case, the dissent was written by Justice Ginsburg. Her dissent became the basis for the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Act, which was passed in the Congress and the first bill to be signed by President Barack Obama. His very first bill to sign. Once again, the Congress more in touch with changing times and expansion of equality in country. The first time was, I think it ended up at 1879 by the time it was finished.
In any event, her passing is like just a death in so many families in our country, because so many people pinned their hopes, heeded her guidance, admired her stamina, her love of the arts, bringing civility to her relationships in the court and in the country. At the same time as we observe her passing, we observe the deaths in the family of 200,000 Americans from the conversation. We mourn every one of them. I had the opportunity to be invited the other day, a couple days ago, when the number was exceeded actually, where there were 20,000 flags on the Mall in front of the Washington Monument. 20,000 flags. Just if you saw the optica, the visual of that many flags representing each one of them, 10 people who had died. 10 families, 200,000 families suffering this loss and some of them not even able to give a hug goodbye or be close to their loved ones as they passed on from this.
It did not have to be this way, but Trump’s contempt of science and the health of the American people, including the cover up of the catastrophic nature of the virus and his resistance to mask wearing, distancing and other science-based steps to slow the virus has led to an historic national tragedy. Terrible, immoral failure on the part of this President. We advanced a science-based proposal to crush the virus in the HEROES Act. That was four months ago. But our insistence on testing began March 4th. That was our first bill that we passed on coronavirus in the Congress. March 4th. Testing, testing, testing. Now, it was in other bills a long way, bipartisan bills. But not implemented. The HEROES Act had not only the resources, but the strategic plan set forth by the Energy and Commerce Committee and its Chairman, Frank Pallone. But ignored science. Science, testing, tracing, treatment, isolation, sanitation, mask wearing. That could have saved many lives. Not all, but many. Either the GOP does not understand the gravity of the situation or do not care about meeting America’s family’s needs.
Again, sadly within hours of Justice Ginsburg’s passing just… Well, they had it planned in advance you know, because we barely heard that she had passed when McConnell said that they were going to approve a justice soon. May she rest in peace? Any sense of decency? I guess not. But you know why? You know why? And this is really important. People talk about this and do that and that. It’s important for the American people to know with that statement and the President’s statement as well, what they’re saying is, “We have to put somebody there.” They’ll never replace Justice Ginsburg. “We have to fill that seat so that we can overturn the Affordable Care Act.” People have to know why this matters to them in their lives. If you have a pre-existing condition of which 150 million families in America do, say goodbye to the benefit. Overturn the benefit of the pre-existing condition.
If your children, and millions of children are, on their parent’s policy. That’s over. Medicaid, Medicare, all of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act to strengthen those initiatives and in terms of Medicaid, if you have a senior member of your family who needs long term care and benefits from Medicaid, pretty soon they’ll be living in your house with you, because that benefit will be gone. And if you’re a woman, the Affordable Care Act said no longer will being a woman be a pre-existing medical condition, something that many of us can speak of first hand, when women paid more, if they could even get the coverage.
So these are just some of benefits that affect America’s families. Kitchen table issues about how they maintain their health and their financial health because healthcare is expensive. So it just goes on and on about what will be gone. That’s the method to their madness. “Let’s just get in there and overturn the Affordable Care Act. And at the same time, we can mess with the elections.” But the thing that matters in people’s personal lives is the Affordable Care Act. And if I just had to say it in one sentence, the pre-existing condition benefit. President’s been in office nearly four years. He keeps talking about supporting pre-existing condition. He doesn’t done anything about it. We would very much been willing to work with him to remove all doubt that if you have pre-existing condition or if your baby is born with some physical needs that area pre-existing condition for a lifetime, and in Affordable Care Act, there is no lifetime limit on what you can receive in terms of benefits.
So this, I’m a little proprietary about the Affordable Care Act and we have defended it to 10,000 events of people telling their stories. That’s how we saved it. That’s how we passed it and that’s how we saved it and that’s what is at risk right now. And that’s why they were in such a hurry.
Yesterday, we had the heartbreaking report, the news breaking that justice was denied of Breonna Taylor and her family. Just think if it were your daughter, your sister, your cousin, your relative, your friend who was murdered by the police and the charging decision held no accountable for her death. In June, the House passed the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act to bring accountability to our justice system. I call upon the Senate to vote upon it immediately. We owe it to Breonna Taylor, to George Floyd, Philando Castile and so many others. To so many others. The provisions in the bill would’ve prevented this from happening.
With all the respect in the world for our men and women in blue, there has to be respect for our police, but respect for doing the job in a way that has justice for all. I was told by one of your cameramen the other day that in the Black community, there’s a saying. “Justice, not just us.” And so we don’t there to be two systems of justice.
This week we had a big bipartisan vote on the CR. I was very pleased that we’ll avert a shutdown, enable us to continue the work of passing elements of the HEROES Act so that we can save lives, livelihood and the life of our democracy. For the children, nearly $8 billion in direly needed nutrition. Assistance for seniors prevented what would’ve happened if we didn’t act. And it’s now like four or five dollars, versus the 50. We saved the Republicans from themselves because we know what we’re doing.
And for our communities, includes a one year surface transportation authorization and for our farmers, boost accountability to the Commodity Credit Corporation, which now prevents and also prevent… Imagine that they were going to use money saying, “This is for the farmers.” Well, we want it to be for family farmers, not necessarily corporate farmers, so we wanted to have clarity and accountability and transparency and all of that. But imagine that they had announced that they were going to spend $300 million from the CCC, which is for farmers, to give a bail out to big oil. The bill prevents that from happening.
And now that the CR’s done, we hope that the administration will come forward with the resources to meet the needs of the American people. We came down a trillion dollars in our $3.4 trillion bill. Then we offered to meet the Republicans halfway. We still haven’t heard back about that. But you know what? Since then, the needs have not decreased, because the President is, again, disdainful, if not contemptible of science. We have not reduced. In fact, some of the needs in terms of the coronavirus are increasing. And we need, related to that, more money for education and we need more money for small businesses, restaurants, airlines and many other key priorities, so we’re going to even need more money, or else we’re going to have to cut some more things down further to stay.
But I’m eager to hear what they have to say when they come, but we’ll be hopefully soon to the table with them, but very soon showing you where our money would be spent. Again, the airline industry, September 30th is fraught with meaning for them. Children in school right now, need more money for children to be there safely in terms of spacing or if it’s virtual, to have the technologies, so that they can learn.
I was very proud yesterday, a few of you were here, when we unveiled our Protecting Our Democracy Act, a robust reform package to address the President’s staggering litany of abuses and ensure that they can never happen again by anyone and any Presidents. Our Chairs, very proud of their work, have crafted robust reforms that can stand up to and prevent, for example, an assault on our democracy, including the abuse of pardon power, of soliciting of foreign interference in our elections, retaliatory attacks on whistleblowers, politicization of tools of justice, abuse of office for personal enrichment, and contempt of Congress’ oversight powers, including our subpoena power.
It’s really sad, because that is central to the genius of the Constitution, the system of checks and balances. Three separate branches of government, a check and balance on the other. It is sad that the President’s actions have made this necessary for us to do. We had no choice but to repair and strengthen our democracy. We cannot look the other way and enable its erosions. Our founders, they figured there could be a rogue President someday, so they built guardrails in to the Constitution. But they didn’t figure we’d have a rogue President and a rogue Senate that would let him get away with all of that. Hence, this is necessary.
In closing, I’ll just say this. 40 days until the election. 40 days. For some of us, in our faiths, 40 is a number that is fraught with meaning. 40 days. 40 days of contemplation, 40 days of prayer, 40 days of resolve, 40 days for the American people to give voice to their concerns and have an election that is about the peaceful transfer of power, which is such a beacon of democracy and hope to the rest of the world. 40 days. Thank you. Any questions?
Well, that’s an outcome we don’t want. We want the peaceful transfer of power, and again, this is about something you’ve heard me say again and again. We don’t agonize, we organize, and we want to make sure that the American people know how important their vote is and how they can vote safely, without risking their health. And it is very sad that you even have to ask that question. A real testimony to the need for protecting our democracy that we put forth yesterday. That a President of the United States would place in doubt the idea of a peaceful transfer of power is… Well, it’s no surprise, again, because the President has been contemptible of science and governance and so you see 200,000 people have died.
But I have confidence in the American people, and I have confidence that he won’t get away with saying, for example, “I won with the vote on the ground, the vote in the mail doesn’t count,” and the rest of that. What am I missing here about people just not saying, “Hold it, calm down, Mr. President.” Now, we do know who he admires. He admires Putin, he admires Kim Jong-un. He admires Erdoğan in Turkey. He admires people who are perpetuating their role in government. But I remind me, you are not in North Korea, you are not in Turkey, you are not in Russia, Mr. President. And by the way, you are not in Saudi Arabia. You are in the United States of America. It is a democracy. So why don’t you just try for a moment to honor your oath of office to the Constitution of the United States?
But yeah, I have confidence and it would not be a good thing for our country for our election to be ignored by the President so that a solution as the Constitution provides for, but nonetheless one that does not, in my view, constitute a peaceful transfer of power.
Yes, sir?
I don’t think he’s worth the trouble at this point. We have 40 days until the election. He is trying to discredit mail in voting, which is hurting, as you’ve heard some of the Republicans say, this has been an important part of our electorate success, mail in voting. He’s discrediting that, vote by mail. And so the answer to it all, the antidote to almost every ailment that I have named is the vote and so right now, our point is, it’s no use our orchestrating one thing or another when what really matters, in terms of a peaceful transfer of power, is that people vote and that they’re vote is counted as cast, whoever they vote for, whatever the outcome. If he honestly gets the majority of the electoral college and is the next President, that’s the peaceful continuation of power.
So this isn’t we just want it if it’s going to be Joe Biden on January 20th. I feel quite certain that it will be. I don’t know if I’m allowed to say. Iwillvote.com. Go there, you can find out how to vote by mail, in person, if you’re registered, how to register. Tell a friend. We have something called the Sojourner Truth Women’s Vote Project. Which Sojourner Truth was a suffragist, she was a slave and she was an abolitionist, and she was very much a part of women getting the right to vote. I dedicated a statue to her… Speaker last time in Emancipation Hall. Very proud of that. So we had this project named for her. And every Tuesday, we have Truth Tuesday, Sojourner Truth. Truth Tuesday to talk about how people can vote and sometimes people say, “I’m not going to vote,” because they just haven’t voted or they don’t know how to vote. We have to remove all those barriers.
Instead, we have a President of the United States who wants to discredit people’s vote. Really? Really? What would our founders think? And what are these Republicans going to say to their children and their grandchildren when they ask them, “What did you do to strengthen our democracy when it was questioned as to whether an election was the proper way to transfer power in our country?”
Right now, 40 days, we just want to get out that vote.
You know, I have the privilege of being a leader in the most diverse party in every possible way, including opinion. A large number of people outside, not in the House, but outside, wanted me to shut down government because of what they’re doing on Justice Ginsberg. Shut down government? I’m not a big believer in shutting down government, but when the West is on fire and the South is battered, storms, and the whole country is suffering from a pandemic and we have a down turn in our economy, and the people we need so that we can do our jobs, public employees, we’re going to shut them down? No, I don’t think so.
So again, the beautiful diversity of our party is that we are not a rubber stamp. We have all kinds of opinions in the party and the fact is, I was very proud that we were able to achieve what we did the other day and have big, strong bipartisan vote to keep government open.
Yes, ma’am?
I’m not going to get into anybody’s interpretation of one thing or another. The confirmation is the work of the Senate and I trust the judgment of our Democrats there to honor the Constitution.
Yes ma’am?
I have a pretty good idea of the method of his madness and what he might try to do to undermine the Constitution. It always is stunning to me to see how complicit and enabling the Republicans are of such a thing. I was pleased that Leader McConnell put out a statement this morning that seemed to go in the direction of protecting the Constitution of the United States. That was a real change. But let me just say that there are three stages to elections. One, everything that happens before, and you see what he’s trying to do.
So we’re in this area where for some it’s still pre-vote time and for others, the election is on. And again, we want people to be able to vote without jeopardizing their health and that’s why we want to have the money in the bill to do just that. It doesn’t seem the health of the American people, as their exercise to vote, does not seem to be of interest or any level of priority to the Republicans. But that discussion goes on.
So we have that. And then we have the election. The actual voting as we get closer and to protect the integrity of the vote and to stop… The President’s even said it, that he’d have people there, the intimidation of the voter. I don’t know why the press doesn’t make more of this, to be very honest with you. I mean, if he says the people swallow Clorox, and we hear about it for the rest of our lives, but he’s trying to have the Constitution of the United States swallow Clorox, and I appreciate these questions that all of you have this morning, and I guess provoked by the arrogance and the disregard for the Constitution with the President’s statement last night.
So I have a pretty good idea of every step of the way, of the danger that he places our Constitution and our elections in, and then he’ll try to say, “Well, I won because I won the votes that turned out that day. Vote by mail doesn’t count.” Really? And there are more elections on the ballot than just his. I’m sure some of these Republicans who win with absentee ballots have a different view, as they have said. And then we’ll just have to make sure the integrity of the electoral college is retained. That is to say, if, as our democracy calls for, if the President wins a state, then those votes go to the President or if the Vice President wins the state, those votes go to the Vice President.
But as with most elections, we have a lot of lawyers at work, because for a little while now there’s been some interest on the other side of undermining the election. We have more now and I won’t go into all of them because… You cannot ignore it because it’s there, but you cannot panic over it. So again, we don’t agonize, we organize. To protect our Constitution, the integrity of our elections, which he has been after for awhile and that was one of the impetuses for the impeachment of the President.
But as of now, 40 days to go. It’s up to the people and we want them to be able to have confidence in their vote. So while we acknowledge, you can’t ignore his ridiculous statements, but you must ensure the people know, you should vote, it will count. Iwillvote.com.
I got to go back to my day job.
No, that’s it. Thank you.

Richard Leonard,United Kingdom,2019-09-23,"Comrades and friends. I bring you greetings from the Scottish Labour Party.
This conference is one of the most important in our entire history. With a General Election imminent, we know that this conference could be a turning point. And it is up to us, because we will only win the forthcoming General Election if we stay rooted in our enduring values of democracy and socialism, if we articulate a positive vision of change for the future, and if we all get 100 per cent behind Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.
And let me also say from the outset, that my aim as the Leader of the Scottish Labour Party is not simply to lead a better management team than the SNP. It is to lead a Scottish Labour Government worthy of the name and It is to go forward winning Scotland back to Labour. Because make no mistake that is the only way to deliver a Labour Government. That is the only way: by electing Scottish Labour MPs. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no shortcut to a Jeremy Corbyn government through the SNP.
So we must work together in a spirit of cooperation and shared endeavour to build a better society in a peaceful world on the strong foundation of a democratic economy, a green economy and a participatory form of politics.
That is the vision of the future that we are offering the people of this country. It is a vision of hope. It is a vision of real change. It is a vision of the future which is worth fighting for. And that means it is not enough to simply tell people what we are against, we need to tell people what we are for.
And we need to stick to the message; the message of investment over cuts, the message of a green industrial revolution to transform our economy, the message that only Labour can stop a No Deal Brexit and can deliver a public vote and the message as well of public ownership of public services.
Because the shareholder dividend and the profit motive should never have had any place in our National Health Service. And it should have no place in the delivery of our bus services, in the delivery of our post, no place in our prisons and no place in our asylum system.
And it should have no place in our Railways either. Which is why I am announcing today that Scottish Labour will be forcing a vote in the Scottish Parliament next week to end the Abellio franchise of ScotRail so that once again we can put passengers before profits. And it is not just in transport that we need fundamental change, it is in the economy, it is in housing, and it is in land.
Let me give you an example. There is a housing emergency in Scotland and the price of land lies at the centre of it. So when we launch our Housing Commission report in the next few weeks, it will make radical recommendations which tackle the excess profits of property developers. Including a proposal to introduce a new law giving local councils, housing associations and housing co-operatives the right to acquire land at an existing use-value.
Good housing policy has always been at the core of Labour Party values. It is where we came from. And under the Scottish Labour Government that I lead, housing will become a national priority again.
From its very beginnings, this party of ours has never stood for the status quo: economically, politically, or constitutionally. We delivered the Scottish Parliament, we delivered the Welsh Assembly. But the UK is still too centralised. Which is why, the time has come for Radical reform again.
And that’s not just the view from Glasgow or Inverness. It’s the view from Manchester and Leeds. And it’s the view from Cardiff too.
And if Brexit is showing us anything, it is that the British constitution is creaking and out of date. And it is time for democratic renewal.
So I am proud that our party will go into government with a new determination to shift power closer to the people. We will extend democracy not just at the ballot box, but in every workplace and in every community.
And so let me be crystal clear, this democratic renewal , this redistribution of power we seek, this is not simply about Parliaments and the Members elected to them. It is about strong local government. It is about redressing the imbalance of power between tenant and landlord, between worker and owner, between citizen and state, between women and men.
So the next Labour government will deliver a new Scotland Act, that will provide for the devolution of employment law with a UK wide floor.
This time last week, I joined Asda workers, GMB members in Glasgow in a national protest. Because I tell you this, if the Labour Party cannot support working people fighting against a basic injustice, then what else are we for?
These workers, most of them women, all of them with years of service, are facing the sack if they do not sign a new contract with cuts to their terms and conditions. If we do nothing else we should change the law to once and for all end this kind of bullying of workers by an employer.
It is not just more powers coming to Scotland that we need, it is a fundamental rebuilding of the broken British state that is required. So that is why we are proposing, at last, the abolition of the House of Lords. I believe that its replacement with an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions, built on a federal settlement, would begin the process of reshaping our whole political system.
These changes will have to be worked for and people won over, but we must be confident; confident in the democratic tradition which we inherit, confident in the socialist ideal that drives us, confident in these practical ideas for radical reform.
We are on the brink of something extraordinary, the greatest opportunity for more than a generation to elect a truly radical, transformative Labour government. And with that opportunity, we send out the clear and simple message from this conference today that a socialist Britain will do far more to improve the lives of the people than a separate Scotland ever could.
So let’s hold our nerve. Let’s keep our faith. Let’s put in the hard work. A Labour government is within our grasp. Let us go out and win it.
",2019 Speech to Labour Party Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/richard-leonard-2019-speech-to-labour-party-conference/
Alan Milburn,United Kingdom,2016-02-19,"It is an honour to be here with my friend and colleague Secretary Thompson. And it is a privilege to join friends and colleagues from around the world. We are all deeply grateful to you Secretary Thompson for hosting this evening and for allowing us to share once again the splendid surroundings of Blair House.
I am grateful to the Commonwealth Fund for once again bringing us together to share common problems and search for common solutions. Co-operation between the US and the UK on health policy, supported through the Commonwealth Fund, is already well developed with work proceeding on patient safety, performance incentives and clinical quality. We are learning much from one another.
There are big problems out there in the world of health care – and I’m sure I speak for every health minister here when I say that we need all the help we can get. There is no one better than the Commonwealth Fund – under Karen Davies’ leadership – in helping us learn from one another by learning together
Tonight is the first opportunity I have had to speak to you since John Eisenberg’s death. I know that the loss of John is still keenly felt here in the United States. I can tell you that in Britian we share that feeling of loss – John was truly a great American but he was also a great friend and support to all of us. He wasn’t just a leader. He was an inspiration. And he will be sadly missed.
I am proud today to be in Washington at a time when the US and the UK have never been closer. When Prime Minister Blair met President Bush in Crawford earlier this year the President spoke for people on both sides of the Atlantic when he said “our nations share more than just a common language and a common history. We also share a common interest in a common perspective on the important challenges of our times.”
September 11th changed the world. It also challenged the world. To stand together for values that are universal, that transcend any one country or any one continent, any one religion or any one language. Freedom and tolerance, the rule of law and respect for human life. These are universal values. Human values. September 11th challenged us to defend them. It challenged the world to defeat an enemy that is not just waging war on America but waging war on us all. The events in Bali challenge us once again not to weaken our coalition behind these values but to renew it and deepen it.
Last year at this conference my good friend Julio Frenck gave a compelling account of the problems confronting health systems in developing countries. Tonight I want to talk about some of those and particularly the challenges facing those of us leading health reform in the developed world.
Today’s world – more prosperous but more insecure than ever – calls for more co-operation than ever. It calls for new coalitions – not least in health care – to express our common interest.
In health care today new technology and knowledge transcend the old borders and boundaries. Demographic change and medical advance bring new possibilities but cause new problems. Expectations always seem to rise but costs never fall.
These waves of change are redefining health care – not just in any one developed country but in all. They present us with common challenges. So far the evidence suggests we have some way to go to meet them. Everywhere the media talk is of health care in crisis. This is not peculiar to one country. It is common to all. Last year’s Commonwealth Fund international health policy survey found that in all five of the countries surveyed a majority of people believed their health system was in need of fundamental change. The specific problems may have varied from nation to nation – waiting times for treatment in the UK and Canada, problems in paying for treatment in the USA, a mix of both these concerns in Australia and New Zealand – but the underlying problem remains the same. How to respond to a world where health care can do more but costs more than ever before.
The good news is this. In the developed world, people are living longer. Our lives are healthier. Deaths claimed by the big killers – cancer and coronary heart disease – are falling. To be sure, new challenges like obesity and diabetes continue to test our ingenuity. But there is no doubt that, taken overall health is improving. And health care spending is growing. The richer we become, the more health care we want to consume. That is as true for countries as for individuals. In the UK after decades when investment in health care fell behind today we have the fastest growing health service of any major country in Europe. Six years ago health care spending was falling in real terms. By 2008 it will have doubled in real terms.
So far so good. And it helps to be an optimist if you are a health minister. However, as Aaron Wildavsky, the eminent policy analyst, once put it: we are ‘doing better but feeling worse’. The danger is that feeling becomes the norm in health care. The weight of public expectation today is enormous. The advent of the consumer society sometimes looks as though it will overwhelm health care systems regardless of how they are structured or funded.
I do not believe that is inevitable. But it requires the courage to change health systems that have got out of tune with the age in which we now live. I believe it requires the forging of a new relationship between services and patients. Where patients are no longer on the outside – purely passive recipients of care – but are on the inside with the power to make decisions and choices about health care.
Reform has never been more needed – or more pressing. In every one of the countries represented here tonight health care reform is at or near the top of the political agenda. This year’s Commonwealth Fund symposium gives us a unique opportunity to understand how lessons learned in one country could be applied in another.
Let me describe how we are approaching reform of the NHS in England.
The National Health Service is pretty unique. It is tax funded and has given Britain a single health care system where services are free at the point of use, based on the needs of patients not their ability to pay. For many, the NHS is part of what it means to be British. It expresses values that are ingrained in the British character
– fairness and decency, compassion and a belief in the power of community. Social justice as a legitimate objective for the nation. And yet for all its great strengths
– its one million staff, its ethos of public service, the great advances it has brought in public health
– the NHS has profound weaknesses. In the fifty years since it was formed the health gap between rich and poor has widened. Too often the poorest services are in the poorest communities. Its centralised top down structure too often stifles local innovation. Staff too often feel disempowered. Local communities feel disengaged. Patients have little say and precious little choice.
Our reform programme seeks to remedy these weaknesses in order to build on the NHS great strengths. At the time the NHS was being formed as a nationalised industry in the UK elsewhere governments – many on the centre left – were creating institutions which favoured greater community ownership over state ownership. As those other nations testify there is no automatic correlation that tax funded health care has to mean health care supply run purely by cental government. In today’s world, tax funded health care can only be sustainable if it sits side by side with diversity in provision and choice for patients.
The NHS scores well on fairness but is weak on choice. Crucially patients wait far too long for treatment. Our reforms seek to preserve equity but improve access. Getting this balance right is what every health care system is struggling to achieve.
In Britain we started five years ago by putting new national standards and a new system of independent inspection in place to tackle what had become a local lottery in services. Priority setting – for decades avoided – has become more open. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence now assesses which treatments are clinically cost effective and should be available to NHS patients. There is no health care system of course that is able to avoid making these decisions. The issue is about how best to do so not about whether it has to be done. And as the accumulated experience of Oregon, New Zealand and elsewhere has shown no system is perfect. In the end, however, in a public service the public have a right to be involved. NICE in appraising health technologies and issuing guidelines already involves patients and the public as well as drawing on expert advice. By the end of this year NICE will have established a Citizens Council to give the public a direct say on the decisions it makes. This is about putting the public on the inside of health care rather than keeping them outside. Dealing with dilemmas – that is what clinicians and policy-makers have to do every day in any health care system. The relentless march of medical advance and public expectations demands that we enlarge the decision-making tent so that more share its rights – and its responsibilities.
Government alone cannot solve health care problems. New relationships are needed both with those with using health services and those providing them. There is a clear role for government of course in setting standards and objectives that ensure equity in provision. In holding the system into account. In stepping in when there is failure in order to uphold standards. But increasingly stepping back to ensure success. In Britain we have learned that a million strong NHS cannot be run from Whitehall. It has got to be run by the local staff and held to account by the local community. We are now at the start of a transition where more and more decisions are taken locally rather than centrally. Where the old style monolithic structures are broken up so that we do not just invest extra resources in frontline services but place power and trust in those frontline services. The simple truth is that health care works best – as Kaiser Permanente have shown here in the US – when it harnesses the commitment and knowledge of clinicians to improve care for patients. The collaborative programmes – pioneered by Don Berwick and others here and now taken up in the UK – are delivering staggering results in reducing waiting times for patients precisely because they shift control to where it counts – on the frontline.
They are helping move health care in Britain from a 1940s model – top down and centralised – to a twenty first century model where standards are national but control is local. Securing improvements in services does not require one – it needs both.
From next April three quarters of the total NHS budget will by controlled by 300 locally run primary care trusts able to purchase care from public, private, voluntary or not-for-profit health care providers. The three year budgets that these primary care trusts will hold will allow them to reshape local services in the interest of local patients. So that there is a greater emphasis on prevention and not just treatment. More intermediate care alongside hospital care. More local services so that people can avoid hospital by being treated in the community. Over these next few years we estimate that as many as one million outpatients appointments could be taken out of hospitals and delivered by primary and community services. That will mean less pressure on hospitals and more convenient care for patients.
I want us to go further still. I have been particularly impressed by evidence here in the US from United Healthcare’s “Evercare” model for older people which, by expanding services in the community and intensively monitoring patients’ conditions to catch illness early, is reducing hospitalisation rates and improving health outcomes. We are in the final stages of agreeing to pilot this approach in Britain in partnership with United Healthcare Group.
An explicit objective of our reforms is to encourage greater plurality in the range of services available to patients. And greater diversity in the range of providers. With more NHS patients treated in private sector hospitals. Greater use of the skills of voluntary and community organisations. New private sector providers becoming a permanent feature of the NHS landscape.
This is about redefining what we mean by the national health service. Changing it from a centrally run monopoly provider to a system where different health care providers – public, private, voluntary and not-for-profit – work to a common ethos, common standards and a common system of inspection. In such a system wherever patients are treated they remain NHS patients because they get care paid for by the NHS according to NHS principles. This is the modern definition of the NHS.
The implications of this redefinition are profound. It means that NHS healthcare does not need to be delivered exclusively be line managed NHS organisations but by a range of organisations working within a national standards framework. The task of managing the NHS becomes one of overseeing a system not an organisation. Accountability becomes more local not national. The shift is from running a large organisation around particular targets towards overall systems performance and health outcomes. In turn that will allow a better concentration on tackling inequalities and improving health rather than just on improving health services.
These changes redefine the role of government too – no longer running but enabling. One of my greatest predecessors as secretary of state for health Nye Bevan – the man who brought the NHS into being – once said: the purpose of getting power is to be able to give it away.
And today there are more pressing reasons than ever for doing so. Not least to re-invest trust in clinicians who for decades have felt that ever more rigorous systems of accountability have undermined their authority. Today it must be a priority to re-engage them. And I believe we can only do so if governments are prepared to transfer control not just to clinicians and managers providing frontline services but to the communities who use them.
In health care the crucial relationships are local ones. Between the doctor and the patient. The community and the hospital. Ownership today needs to be local not national. That’s why we plan to give local communities – alongside local staff – control over the best performing local NHS hospitals. A new generation of NHS Foundation Hospitals will be run by local people not national politicians.
This too is about putting the public on the inside. Some will say that the risks are too great. That health care has to be determined by politicians and professionals. I think the risk is quite the reverse. If we keep people out they will demand more not less from a system that will not be able to cope. Health care today needs to embrace the public as partners not as passive recipients. The spread of universal education has made for a more inquisitive and demanding public that is less willing to accept that politicians or professionals always know best. The internet is redistributing knowledge. Information that used to be the preserve of the doctor can now be accessed by the patient. None of this is going to go away. It is here to stay. It is here for good. And I believe that, despite the pressures it brings, in the end it is a force for good.
The evidence suggests that the informed patient is a better patient. In arthritis care for example educating patients and increasing their role in self-management has been shown to produce better outcomes. Patients with chronic conditions – a growing proportion of the cared for population – have to live with their condition every hour of every day. They need to have a greater role and a bigger say in their own care.
The emergence of more informed and expert patients has profound implications for relationships between patients and health care professionals. It means professionals taking patients into their confidence. Communicating better. Acknowledging risks as well as benefits. Actively seeking consent. Owning up to mistakes not covering them up. Earning trust, not just assuming it.
Public services do not belong to professionals, still less to politicians – they belong to the public who use them and who fund them. Services – whether they are private or public – succeed or fail according to their ability to respond to modern expectations. In today’s consumer age hey have to be tailor made to the needs of the user, not mass produced to the convenience of the producer. That is why for the first time the views of patients themselves now influence the performance ratings – and therefore the resources and freedoms – each NHS organisation receives.
A modern health service is one in which patients can exercise more power. And that means more choice. In Britain we are moving to a system where, for the first time, within the NHS, patients will be able to choose the hospital, the time of treatment and even the doctor that is best for them. And because resources will follow the choices patients make it will provide real incentives for improvements in performance. Those hospitals that perform best will get more, those that do not, will not. There is a simple deal on offer here. The better you do the more you get. It is a discipline that needs to work just as much in the public services as in the private sector. It will take time to get there of course. But when we do it will put patients in the driving seat – at the heart of the health service – and not before time.
And giving patients more rights makes it easier to demand more responsibilities. To use services appropriately. To treat health care professionals respectfully. To contribute to their own health and wellbeing. To help others through blood donation or organ donation. To acknowledge that there are limits to what any health care system can provide. To give as well as to take.
That is what co-operation and partnership are all about – giving as well as taking. When President Bush met Prime Minister Blair in April, the President made the following commitment on behalf of our two nations “even as we work to make the world a safer place we must also work to make the world better.”
Today half the world’s people live on less than $2 a day. Hunger remains endemic. 10 million children die each year from preventable childhood illnesses. Millions more die from AIDS, TB and malaria. And yet the gap between where we are and where we could be is not so great. There are effective and relatively inexpensive ways of tackling HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and childhood infectious diseases. Support is needed – in cash of course – but also in kind. Developed nations could do so much more to help the developing world build the skills and the capacity that are needed to deliver effective health services. Our nations have an abundance of skills in health. It is time we shared them with others. And perhaps the Commonwealth Fund could consider how best we do so.
A world of open borders and easy travel, mass migration and rapid information means that a problem somewhere can quickly become a problem everywhere. In this interdependent world common problems do indeed call for common solutions. The events of the last year have brought home to all of us that our countries cannot enjoy the fruits of growth and development oblivious to the challenges faced by the rest of the world. Terrorism thrives only when one set of moral values look to others immoral. If one part of the world stands aside from the problems of another. If prosperity seems indifferent to poverty. If resources and skills are used for the benefit of some but not for all.
Defeating terrorism calls for a war on all fronts. In the end we will defeat terrorism because it is the enemy of all nations and all faiths. The enemy of humanity itself. We will defeat it of course by intelligence, by police and even military action. By the vigilance and the support of our peoples. But we will defeat it also in the triumph of the values that terrorism abhors – tolerance, freedom, the rule of law, the respect for human life.
These are the values which unite the nations of the Commonwealth Fund. They are the values which inspire us to share perspectives on common problems in health care and encourage us to co-operate in pursuit of solutions to them. I want to thank our friends and hosts here in the USA and wish us all a positive and productive few days at this Symposium. I believe the strength of our common endeavours this week demonstrates that health is no longer just a matter of domestic policy. Health policy today is truly international: shared challenges across boundaries; shared solutions between countries and a shared understanding that the interests of the developed world are linked inextricably to those of the developing world.

James Brokenshire,United Kingdom,2018-10-16,"I have published a technical consultation on how to implement the Government’s reforms to the leasehold system in England.
This consultation marks the next step in my personal commitment to tackle exploitative and unjustifiable practices in the leasehold sector, making homeownership fairer for all.
Unjust leasehold terms also risk making relatively new houses unattractive to buyers. Therefore, last year the Government announced they would introduce ​legislation to prohibit the unjustified granting of new residential long leases on new build or existing freehold houses, other than in exceptional circumstances, and restrict ground rents in newly established leases of houses and flats to a peppercorn.
In addition, we want to address loopholes in the law to improve transparency and fairness for leaseholders and freeholders. This includes providing freeholders with equivalent rights to leaseholders to enable them to challenge the reasonableness of estate rent charges or freehold service charges for the maintenance of communal arrears and facilities on a private or mixed estate.
Finally, we want to introduce measures to improve how leasehold properties are bought and sold.
The consultation details a number of proposals setting out how our plans may work in practice. It asks important questions to understand people’s views on how this could affect them. It sets out and seeks views on:
how the changes to prevent unjustified new leasehold houses will work in practice, in what circumstances any exemptions will be provided, and how the policy will be enforced;
the future nominal ground rent for new leasehold properties being capped at £10 per annum, and what exceptional circumstances may warrant exemption;
how we intend to provide freeholders with equivalent rights to leaseholders to enable them to challenge the reasonableness of an estate rent charge or a freehold service charge for the maintenance of communal arrears and facilities on a private or mixed estate; and
measures to improve how leasehold properties are bought and sold.
We will use the evidence we gather to inform the legislation and the accompanying impact assessment.
The consultation will run for six weeks and will close on 26 November 2018. It is available online at: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementing-reforms-to-the-leasehold-system, and I have placed a copy in the House Library.
Since becoming Secretary of State, I have already taken steps to ensure excessive and unfair leasehold practices are brought to an end. No new Government funding schemes will now support the unjustified use of leasehold for new houses.
This consultation, and the legislation which will follow, will make the leasehold system fairer, more transparent, and cheaper for home owners in the future.

Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2015-10-22,"Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings, members of the committee. The terrorist attacks at our diplomatic compound and later, at the CIA post in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 took the lives of four brave Americans: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.
I am here to honor the service of those four men, the courage of the Diplomatic Security agency and the CIA officers who risked their lives that night, and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world.
I knew and admired Chris Stevens. He was one of our nation's most accomplished diplomats. Chris's mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, because he was always moving, always working, especially in the Middle East that he came to know so well.
When the revolution broke out in Libya, we named Chris as our envoy to the opposition. There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century American envoy. But his work was very much 21st century hard-nosed diplomacy.
It is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi. They held signs reading ""thugs don't represent Benghazi or Islam."" ""Sorry people of America, this is not the behavior of our Islam or our Prophet."" ""Chris Stevens, a friend to all Libyans.""
Although I didn't have the privilege of meeting Sean Smith personally, he was a valued member of our State Department family. An Air Force veteran, he was an Information Management officer, who had served in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague.
Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty worked for the CIA. They were killed by mortar fire at the CIA's outpost in Benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. They were both former Navy SEALs and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
As Secretary of State, I had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.
Losing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally.
I was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our Ambassador to to the President.
After the attacks, I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket and those of the other three Americans off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base.
I took responsibility. And, as part of that, before I left office, I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.
What happened in Benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting Accountability Review Board, seven prior Congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
So today I would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.
First, America must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.
The State Department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.
Chris Stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed. In fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.
He also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.
Since 2001, there have been more than one hundred attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.
But if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they'll tell you they can't do their jobs for us from bunkers.
It would compound the tragedy of Benghazi if Chris Stevens' death and the death of the other three Americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.
We have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.
That's why Chris was in Benghazi. It's why he had served previously in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem during the second intifada.
Nobody knew the dangers of Libya better – a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time.
He knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country's fragile transition to democracy. And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia.
He also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. The nearest Israeli airport is just a day's drive from the Libyan border.
Above all, Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremists' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. That's what those thousands of Libyans were saying after they learned of his death. He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.
Retreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead. That doesn't mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort. Quite the opposite.
We need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America's strengths and values. Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.
And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country—our country—because they believed – as I do – that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.
After previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. That's what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack, attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.
It's what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve Americans. It's what happened during the Bush administration after 9/11.
Part of America's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.
After the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been eighteen previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.
And the Review Board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements. I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation. And they were. More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies. Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.
And Secretary Kerry has continued this work. But there is more to do. And no administration can do it alone. Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.
For example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field. But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.
Finally, there is one more observation I'd like to share:
I traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.
Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree — far from it — but we do come together when it counts.
As Secretary of State, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. I worked with Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.
I know it's possible to find common ground, because I have done it.
We should debate on the basis of fact, not fear. We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.
So I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.
And my challenge to you, members of this Committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.
Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons. To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.
That's what I tried to do every day as Secretary of State. And it's what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.
",Opening Statement to House Select Committee on Benghazi,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/opening-statement-house-select-committee-benghazi
John Prescott,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"Well, what a week it’s been! The people are coming home to Labour. Labour coming home to government.
We’ve been away too long. And millions of people have paid the price for it. We’ve adopted the football song Coming Home. I hear that next week John Major is planning to revive his own 1966 football anthem.
But John, honestly, you can’t make the same impact with World Cup Willie.
But what a great conference we’ve had! Labour’s coming home, And coming together.
Bringing together all the strands in the party – old and new. Bringing together the politics of ideas and the politics of organisation. I told you it would work.
This week we’ve faced tough choices. Spoken the language of priorities. No more the party of Opposition but a government in waiting.
Counting the days and the weeks till we get rid of this Tory government.
Because this week will go down in history as the week when Labour – a party reborn, proud of its heritage, confident of its future, clearly proved it is ready for Government.
This week we have seen the team which will form the next Labour government. Led by Tony Blair, our great and sagacious leader. As I always call him.
Compare him with the Galloping Major running scared of Labour, running scared of his own MPs, running scared of an election. And most of all John Major is running scared of Tony Blair.
Because here is a man who leads from the front.
I’ll tell you what. It may be a bumpy ride at times, I know that well enough.
But Tony is a man who knows where he’s going. Who has a clear vision of where the country should be going too. Who strikes a chord with the British people. A man who deserves to be the next Prime Minister of this country.
You know, this week you can really feel the anticipation in the air. You can feel it running through conference.
What a contrast with next week when the Tories turn up in Bournemouth. I can’t wait, can you? The Tories are divided, desperate and dangerous. And they are up to their necks in sleaze.
What a miserable lot they are too, aren’t they? The only Tory worth backing to win at the moment is Frankie Dettori.
Just take a look at the gang in charge. John Major. He used to be a banker, you know. He must have worked for the No-one’s Listening Bank. No one listens to him in his own cabinet. No one listens to him in Europe. No one listens to him in Parliament.
But there’s more bad news for John Major. They’re closing his favourite eating-place. The Happy Eater. He’s so depressed. The Happy Eater was the only place he could get anyone to take his orders.
Then there’s Michael Heseltine, the man who advises firms to delay on paying their debts. They say as a politician he owes a lot to Churchill, but Winston’s still waiting for the payment.
He says the economy is bouncing back. But why are so many cheques doing the same?
Then there’s the Home Secretary Michael Howard, The man responsible for the rule of law. He’s up before the judges so often, he asks for his previous offences to be taken into consideration.
And finally there’s Major’s side-kick, Doctor Mawhinney, The Colonel Sanders of the Tory Party. Leading the chicken run.
There’s something you should know about Brian Mawhinney, in case you bump into him. He always get very ratty if you don’t call him Doctor. This began to puzzle me, since he’s the only doctor I’ve ever met who makes everyone feel sick.
I phoned the British Medical Association. They said they’d never heard of him. I began to think he isn’t a chicken at all. He’s a quack.
But then I thought, maybe he’s a spin doctor. But I checked with Peter Mandelson and he said: No he isn’t in the Union …Sorry, Association.
And then I thought, anyone who can turn a &amp;pound;17 million deficit into a &amp;pound;24 million surplus must be a Witch Doctor.
Or maybe he’s Doctor Doolittle. Talking to the animals with their snouts in the trough.
We’ve got to get to the bottom of this. The publics got to be protected.
But I tell you one thing. After the election, he’s going to be …. Doctor Who?
The best slogan he could think up for their conference next week is Life’s better under the Tories. Sounds to me like one of Steven Norris’s chat up lines.
Can you believe that this lot is in charge? Not for long, eh?
Then after 17 years of this Tory government, they have the audacity to talk about morality.
Did you hear John Major on the Today programme? – calling for ethics to come back into the political debate?
I’m told some Tory MPs think ethics is a county near Middlesex. It’s a bit hard to take: John Major – ethics man.
The Tories have redefined unemployment they have redefined poverty. Now they want to redefine morality.
For too many Tories, morality means not getting caught.
John Major’s argument is that cutting public spending and reducing tax is a moral issue.
And what a perverted definition of morality! It’s all about money in the pocket, isn’t it?
And we’ve heard an awful lot about money in the pockets of Tory MPs lately, haven’t we? I heard two Tory MPs talking last week about cash for questions. One said: What should we do about the Sleaze Bill? The other said: Get someone else to pay it.
Neil Hamilton, that Guardian of Tory morals, told the Deputy Prime Minister he had no financial relationship with a lobbying company. But now we hear he did take payments after all.
But will he resign? No. Tories never know when to say sorry. And if John Major is serious about morality, He should let Nolan look into party funding.
On Wednesday I called on John Major to join Labour to clean up British politics. Yesterday he said he’ll give evidence. Well I’m afraid that’s just not enough.
If Neil Hamilton has a shred of honour left in him, he should go and go now.
But John Major can’t afford to lose him, can he? Why? Because this man is his parliamentary majority of one. He is John Major’s immoral majority. And the silent majority have had enough of them.
Because let’s be clear, Morality is measured in more than just money. It&amp;#18;s about right and wrong. it&amp;#18;s about values. it&amp;#18;s about fairness and it’s about social justice.
I’d like to ask John Major this: what morality is there ……. In one man making &amp;pound;34 million out of rail privatisation, when so many of our people live in poverty?
Where’s the morality in people being bussed from one hospital to another begging to be admitted?
Where’s the morality In record crime? In record unemployment? Record bankruptcies? Record poverty?
All the product of deliberate government policy. That’s what I call immoral.
And where’s the morality in 16 year old kids forced to sleep rough on the streets?
Do you know it’s 30 years since the film Cathy Come Home shocked this nation about the plight of the homeless?
And after 17 years of Tory government, there are thousands more like Cathy -record numbers of homeless people.
But don’t believe the Tory lie that nothing can be done. It’s time the nation was shocked again.
Because – what’s really immoral is this…. There’s &amp;pound;5 billion from council house sales locked up by the Tory government. There’s a quarter of a million building workers trapped in unemployment.
But the Tories refuse to bring them together. Labour will bring together the money, the people, the skills to meet the social need of our people.
Labour’s coming home. And when we are in government, Cathy can come home too.
That’s the moral difference between us and the Tories. There is an alternative. New Life for Britain our philosophy our priorities our programme for government.
It’s a radical document, It will make a real difference to the lives of ordinary people.
And we are not just asking you to sign up to it for the next few months. It’s for the first five years of a Labour government.
This programme shows we are a party with a heart. We will enthuse our supporters and convince the voters.
We are a party of principle. We will earn the trust of the British people.
We are a party with vision. We will give the inspiration people have been looking for. An age of achievement. A decent society.
And we are a party with compassion – who are prepared to stand up for the rights of the poor, the sick, the unemployed and yes pensioners.
And when we talk about our pensioners. Remember it was Labour who brought in the decent state pension.
It was Labour who brought in SERPS – the Earnings Related Pension.
It was Labour who enabled occupational pensions to flourish.
The Tories have never done anything for pensioners.
The only raise they gave them was to put VAT on fuel.
Our commitment shows it. Our history proves it. A Labour government will not forget our pensioners.
We are a Party of ambition and aspiration.
It was Ernest Bevin who warned us against the poverty of ambition. Taking second best for granted.
We want to unlock the potential of our people. To allow people to live their lives to the full to achieve just a few of their dreams.
I was an 11 Plus failure. But I was given a second chance. By my trade union as a matter of fact. When they sent me to Ruskin College.
It opened my eyes. It excited my mind.
Tories will say ‘That shows the system’s working.’ But I was one of the lucky ones. And I know there are millions of people who have been written off.
Who never got a first chance, a second chance or a third chance. And it’s our job to make sure they get a chance in the future.
That’s why Tony Blair was right when he said educate educate educate, to unlock the potential in our people.
Yesterday this conference overwhelmingly endorsed New Life for Britain.
Now for the first time we are asking every one of our members and millions of trade union members to pledge their support.
This will be the one of the greatest exercises in party democracy in history. Never before has a party set out its programme so far in advance of an election. This is not a three week manifesto. It’s for members to vote on, to pledge their support and to campaign on from now until election day. And for a Labour government to implement after the election.
But it’s only as good as you present it, So read it, understand it, campaign with it take the message to the people in your community.
The ballot papers are going out, at this very moment, to millions of homes.1,500 coordinators are ready, in the constituencies.To organise to conduct this ballot; to ensure everyone is involved. Phil Wilson is here with some of those volunteers. Stand up Phil, so we can see you.
Look in your post tomorrow. And when your ballot paper arrives vote Yes for a New Life for Britain. And if you need an extra incentive, just turn on the telly next week, tune in to the Tory party conference.
When they won’t talk about their record, when they refuse to do anything about the crucial issues.
Don’t just get angry, do something positive.
Get the ballot paper off the mantelpiece. Put a cross in the box. And Vote yes for a new life for Britain.
But to all of you who are watching out there on your TV sets, There’s more than that to do.
There’s no more standing on the sidelines now. The time to hesitate is over.
Now is the time to get involved. Come and join us in the Labour party. Join our campaign.
So I ask all party members to vote, to organise, and help us in our campaign.
Because when the vote is over, when you have pledged your support and endorsed our programme, the job is not finished.
We have to put the case to the people of Britain.
In New Life for Britain we have many proposals. But we highlight those five key pledges. Set out on this card.
This card is a campaigning tool to help you take the message to the electorate.
Straightforward pledges which capture our basic principles.
Smaller classes
tough on crime
shorter waiting lists
more jobs for the young
a strong economy.
Let’s take the issue of jobs first of all. To spell out what we mean in that commitment.
To get 250,000 under 25s out of benefit and into work. But it goes deeper than that.
This pledge is symbolic of our ambition to provide job opportunities for all. Because we believe government can make a difference. And it has a responsibility to seek a high and stable level of employment.
That’s why we are different from the Tories. And it will be paid for by a windfall levy on the profits of the privatised utilities.
Yesterday I was sent this pledge card from Northumbrian Water Actually it says: New Northumbrian Water.
It contains five pledges. But I’ll add a sixth.
Pay the new windfall levy and put our kids back into new jobs . That’s what I call jobs and social justice.
In Education, our pledge is to reduce class sizes for 5 6 and 7 year olds to 30 or less. But we are saying more than that. This pledge symbolises our strong commitment to comprehensive education. Which gives everyone a chance, not just a few.
And there will be no return to the 11 plus.
We want a good state education system for the many not just the few. And we will pay for it out of the Assisted Places Scheme which subsidises private schools. And take unemployed teachers off the dole to teach our children. That’s jobs and social justice.
In our card, we pledge to cut NHS waiting lists by treating an extra 100,000 patients, Because we believe in the principle – the socialist principle – of a health service, based on need, not the ability to pay. Giving greater priority to the needs of the patient, not the needs of the market.
And we will pay for it from the money saved from the huge bureaucratic waste of the internal market.
That’s jobs and social justice.
Together with a strong economy and action on crime, these are among the building blocks of a decent society.
Bringing together our traditional values and putting them into practice in modern ways in a modern setting. That’s what we are about.
We are proud of our history. And we are determined about our future.
There are at most 200 days to the general election. The countdown starts now.
Victory will not come easily.
It will mean knocking on doors, canvassing, hitting the phone buttons, good organization.
And we can’t rely just on our sound bites and the media message alone.
Yes they’re important.
But we can’t do without the people who do the work – activists they are called.
Ordinary people talking to ordinary people.
You can make the difference between winning and losing.
The general election campaign starts right here, right now…
We have the best professional organisation.
The best programme for government.
The best and most popular leader.
Now we must deliver.
The minute conference ends, Tony and I will be leaving here to visit key seats on our way home.
Even though Tony and I are carrying on working, you can have the rest of the day off.
But I want you out working tomorrow. And if you can’t visit a key seat this weekend, I want a promise you’ll visit one soon.
Because the key seats are the battleground for the next election.
So during these next 200 days ask yourself each day Did I do enough today?
Could I have done more to secure a Labour victory? Let that question stay in your mind right up to the general election. Think about what you can do to play your full part. Ask yourself: Did I do enough today?
Think of that day on the 10 April 1992. When we faced another five years of Tory government…… And said: If only……, If only…..
I will never forget that day burned into my memory Neil Kinnock speaking on the steps of Walworth Road, conceding defeat, With great dignity and emotion. He echoed our frustration, disappointment and despair.
Never, never, never again.
That image will only be extinguished when we see Tony Blair on the steps of 10 Downing Street, Announcing a magnificent Labour victory in the next general election.
And we will never forget the people who led us through the hard times to the threshold of government today. John Smith, Neil Kinnock, and yes Michael Foot.
Victory is within our grasp after seventeen long years.
A chance to serve – that’s all we ask. And with your help, and the people’s trust, we can win.
That will give new hope to pensioners, new hope to young people, new hope for the low paid and families, new hope for industry.
New hope for the whole of the British people.
We’ve had enough lies.
Enough sleaze. Enough excuses. Enough poverty. Enough unemployment. Enough failure. Enough is enough.
We are united and ready to govern.
This was the week when old and new came together.
A Labour Party united.
A country united
A new Labour government.
New hope for Britain.
",1996 Speech to Labour Party Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/john-prescott-1996-speech-to-labour-party-conference/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-04-10,". And we start talking, and the first person gets up and said, sir, we have many people dying coming across the border.
Because they'll come across the border, and it's a vast, vast area, and they'll be dropped off and they start walking. And they'll say Houston's right down the road, but is actually 300 miles away. And we find dead people from Guatemala, Honduras, from El Salvador, from Mexico all over. I said nobody ever said that.
They say, well, they know it but the press doesn't talk about it. Many, many dead people, many. Also, they come in and raid their houses, and it's very dangerous. And they're told never to leave their house at night, and at the day -- during the day, always carry a gun and know how to use it. And where they have their fences -- because these are big ranches...
. And I said nobody's ever told me this. This doesn't come out in the fake news and this doesn't come out in the press. And these people had no idea they were going to do this.
But I said you know what? We have the media here. We have some very good people in the media here, actually. And I think it should be explained. Nobody's ever heard this. I don't think they've ever heard this. And maybe I'll start with Gene. Gene, maybe -- Gene, can you start?
And we'll go through. But these are incredible stories. I had no idea. Nobody has any idea how bad this is. And this has been going on for many years, many, many years. But now they're coming up because the economy is so strong. But regardless, this has been going on and many people are dying. And the danger of living here, unless you know exactly what you're doing, is tremendous, where your wife carries a gun and she's trained in using it. But maybe you start off, Gene.
Often.
Often.
And again, they all want the wall. If we had the wall, the -- the good people will not be able -- and they'll be -- and you'll see them on the other side of the wall. People can -- number one, they won't come because they'll say there's no way of getting through. Right now they think there is a way of getting through.
And the people back home never hear about them. They start the walk that they think Houston's, you know, half a mile away but it's 300 miles. And it's desert. And I asked Mr. Powell, I said let me ask you a question. When you -- you know, when you do this, why aren't they -- like, why aren't people around to help these people?
He said this is a vast state. It's a vast area. You look at it. I mean, the state's tremendous. We don't see that. You know, we come -- I come from New York. You have Fifth Avenue and that connects to Park Avenue. But this is, you know, hundreds of miles between places.
And it's just -- I've heard some incredible stories. Does anyone want to go? You had told me something very interesting. Go ahead, please.
And they're very expensive fences, but they don't want to go through the process of going through the fences. So again, they wait until the fence is open, the gate is open. They wait at the gates and they kill people, and they want to take the truck. A lot of times they don't even want to go to the house.
They want to steal the truck. So, you always go to the gate in doubles. This has been going on for many years and it's coming up. I'm bringing it out because we're bringing out what's happening with our border. And these people are coming into our country. Some are dying during the walk. Many of those people, I'll bet, are very good people.
But some are dying during the walk, many, many have died. That was what surprised me. I said how many, and one of the folks said, well, we had seven in the last fairly short period of time, seven. I said seven? That's one person said no, they're all over the part of Texas that we're talking about. That means they're all over other places...
...Too, including New Mexico, California. Please.
Yeah...
Right.
And I've been saying that from day one --
Because it's common sense --
Right.
You said 3 percent?
So, you're saying that the people from -- you said before Colombia and also from Guatemala?
Honduras.
El -- are much tougher people and much more dangerous people?
So, you -- that's says a lot.
By the way, remember this. Those countries are sending the tough ones. They're sending the gang members. That's -- those are the people they're sending to the United States. Now, the Democrats don't want to do anything about it. I'm doing something about it. The Democrats don't want to do it. But he just said it. And Mr. Powell and all of you, we've talked about it. People from Mexico, they come in, they help with the farming, they go out, no problem.
But they were saying that the people coming from much further away, they're sending the real killers, including MS-13, because they don't want them in Honduras and El Salvador and -- they don't want the gangs, so there sending them to our country. And they probably are the ones that run out of water and run out of food.
Right?
They're -- do you have something to say, Lieutenant Governor?
One of the folks back here was saying that -- I said really? How often does that happen? All the time. How many have you seen? Eleven. Eleven over what period of time? Over a short period of time, 11 bodies. And they -- if it's not the bodies, they are attacked. They are accosted. \ And very importantly, these people come into our country long beyond Texas.
I mean, they go into our -- our states that have nothing to do, you would think, with the border. But they go in. They go into -- the deeper the better. And it is really a disgrace, and nobody talks about it. You don't have anybody talking about it. And I even said -- even my Republican colleagues, and they're with us all the way, but they don't hear these stories.
I never heard the story. This was not a scheduled news conference. You people are here. This was not scheduled, as you know. I said to these people can you tell the press, because this is the thing that's been going on for years. I mean, when your wife, when she doesn't carry, she doesn't have a chance where you can't go up to a gate and open the gate without a guy standing there with a rifle because people want to steal your truck and they'll do it and kill you.
They'll kill you, take your truck, sometimes go in, rob the house, then who the hell can live like this? And it's not just here at the border. But these are stories that I've never heard before and I've been doing this stuff very intentionally for two and a half years.
Tell them. Please tell them.
-- And you are also --
But you're also saying that the people coming up from areas that you, you know, did used to have a long time ago but you have over the last, let's say 10 years, you're saying the level of toughness is much different than it used to be.
They were saying that -- you have to hear some of the stories. And again, I don't think -- I said look, anybody want to not -- everybody said they'll agree to go and do this. I thought you'd have some that would say I don't want to get involved. But the stories are incredible about the level of toughness, the gangs, the craziness -- they're crazy and they're coming in. And those countries are sending them up. I -- I have no doubt that Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador and Columbia with its new president, but unfortunately their drug business has gone up 50 percent since he's been there, those countries are sending them because they don't want them in their country.
They're sending them to the United States because they think that the people in the United States are stupid and they take them. And we are represented by Democrats that don't want to hear it because to them, they'll take anybody. They don't care about crime, they just want to get votes. They think these are all going to be votes for them someday, and other reasons.
Maybe they want to look make the country look bad. But let me tell you, we have a problem and you people expressed it far better than anybody I've heard. I can't believe it. How many did you find last month? Well, seven died on their ranch on one ranch. Seven. I said what are you talking about, seven? They start walking and it is the expanse.
That's the thing, nobody knows the expanse. Nobody knows what we're talking about because it's so big. The state and this whole area, the border -- the border is big. We're talking about 2000 miles and these people start walking and this scum, the coyotes. The law -- the worst scum in the world, the coyotes, and they take their last amount of money, they leave them nothing and they give them some water and a sandwich, and they start walking and they have hundreds of miles to walk.
They leave them to die and their dying all over the place and nobody knows it.
Ad if you had a wall on the other side, you had a wall, they wouldn't be able to get through. And they are easy to -- you know, you can take, on a humanitarian basis, you can have food cars, you can have trucks, you can take them to someplace where they can be taken care of and it won't come. You won't have so many because if they know they can't get through, they're not going to come.
All of a sudden, they're not going to come. And we are building a lot of wall. You know, the other day I saw the fake news. They were saying I didn't build a wall. You know why? Because they said I ripped down a wall because I just left with them, a lot of these people. We ripped down a wall that was dead.
It was useless. We ripped and we built a new one. They said that one was already there. We built a brand-new wall, we showed it to them, and some of them, because they are dishonest deal, some of them said we didn't build a wall. Why did we build a wall question mark because there was a wall already there.
But what they don't say is we ripped it down because it was worthless, it was garbage. And people walked right through it. So we built an incredible new wall it was even my design, my design, our contractors, they just left. The tractor marks are right there, the machinery is still there, and these people left, they said we didn't build a wall.
The wall was already there. Your dishonest people, many of you, and many of you aren't. This is a very important story. People are dying. Great people are dying. Bad people are coming up. You have both. You have the gang members that are being thrown out by these countries because they don't want them and they figure let the United States handle it. We're not going to do it. And then we have judges in the Ninth Circuit in particular, but we have judges that will rule against us no matter what.
Two days ago, we had a judge ruled against us because he said he doesn't want people staying in Mexico. Mexico is too dangerous. Let them come in here. This is crazy. It's crazy. So I thought that even though this was not a planned news conference, I thought this was so important to say where you have people dying all over the place and when you mentioned a thousand, Dan, I think it's much, much more than a thousand.
-- Over the last short while --
Does anybody else have anything to say: would you like to say anything?
They're dying in the brush.
So I said, what's the solution? You live here, you know the area so well, but you know the border better than anybody. This is in the border. The border is a ways away but you get plenty of action even appear but the border is down there but many of them are involved with the border. What's the -- what -- what really is the answer?
It's that you've got to have a wall. You've got have a wall. If you don't have a wall, it's never going to end. Dangerous people are coming here and the good people are dying. The good people are dying. And the good people are being robbed and being killed by the bad people. They are being killed by gang members because some of them have a little money left after giving it to the coyotes.
They have money left. And the gang members will take the money from the good people and let them die or kill them, MS-13 and others. It would be so great if you'd write a straight story and let -- let the world know. I mean, this is a small group of people that are good people. If you could let the world really know what's happening, this is so important.
From a humanitarian -- not because of Trump, from a humanitarian standpoint, I had no -- nobody has any idea how bad it has been for many years. So there it is. There's our press conference. Thank you all very much.
No, because I can understand them not saying it. They been saying we need a wall. We need a wall badly. They have told me many other things but they haven't. This is a group of people that I just said what can I do for you and -- and they actually started out by saying sir, many people are dying. I said what are you talking about?
-- Because I'll bet you've been covering the stuff for a long time too. You haven't heard stories like this. This is an incredible story.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's funny, I have a lot of people standing out there waiting for me to speak and it's really a campaign event and I don't -- I couldn't care less about the campaign. This is not a campaign, this is now telling people whatever it -- it's really telling the truth. We have to do something about it. Nobody's ever heard that.
Hey, your reporters. You've occur covered this thing for many years, the whole thing with the border, we've all been involved with the border. I've been involved probably less time than you have but I know what's going on. From the time I made my first speech at Trump Tower when I mentioned the word rape and everybody went crazy because that turned out to be nothing compared to what happens on those journeys out.
Nothing. My speech was so tame as it turned out. No, this is just something I'm sitting here, we're talking, I said what can we do? And one of the folks at this table said very specifically, many, many people are dying. They're dying all over our fields. They're dying on their fields all over. Who was the one that said they'll go out to the field and they'll find bodies all the time?
Somebody said it. Who was it? That was you.
All of them. All of them. They go out there and find bodies. Excuse me, they go over, they find bodies lying all over the field including many pregnant women. Many pregnant women. They give it a little water, go out and start walking. Walk to Dallas, and Dallas is 250 miles away. It's -- it's really bad, you really should cover it right.
This has nothing to do with politics, this has nothing to do with campaigning or my campaign, this is totally unexpected that I'd have you in here. But these people said it better than anybody else could say it because they have to live it and it's dangerous and it's really from a humane standpoint, a humanitarian standpoint, it's horrible.
Thank you very much, everybody.
I have respect for him, but I haven't really thought about that. I'm very happy right now with Kevin. I will say this, I would really rather have you focus on this topic than -- you could ask me a million questions about a million things and I'd love to answer them, but I will -- I will say that -- I will say that I think you should really focus on this.
This is a very important development that the press has not covered. You don't cover this. You don't cover this. How is it possible that you have bodies lying all over these big areas and nobody talks about it? And Dan was telling me that the press doesn't want to write about it.
The make a lot of bucks.
I could, if you want. Do you want to do that? We'll just do it very quickly because we have to go and we have a lot of people waiting.
","Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Roundtable with Supporters in San Antonio, Texas",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-immigration-roundtable-april-10-2019
Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2007-03-14,"Hello, how are you doing? Thank you. Thank you all. Thanks so much and thanks for last night too. It's an honor and pleasure to be here this morning. It was a lot of fun to be here last night.
You know as I look around this room which is packed with people whom I admire so much, I see a lot of old friends, and it's been an honor to stand with you. We've stood together in good times and bad times. We've stood together when it seemed as though the darkness would never end and when we finally saw the light. So it is just a personal honor of the highest degree to be here today. And I want to thank also my friend and your great leader for that wonderful introduction. You know Harold and Vinny have been the heart and soul of leading this great, great union. And we've been through a lot, but the thing about going through tough times with Harold and Vinny on your side is that you know that you're not going to be alone. And that has meant the world to those of us from New York. And we have a lot of firefighters from across New York here today and I want to thank you all for everything you do, every single day.
When I think about the work that you do and the service and commitment that you have given to your nation, I know that for all of you, courage is a job requirement. You don't make this decision to be a firefighter easily or quickly. You have to think about the sacrifice and you have to think about your families. For you when you go to work, when you go to that fire house or that station these are not just your colleagues, these are members of your extended family. And I recognize how much this family, both the one that you leave at home as you kiss your wife goodbye or you tuck your son into bed are part of the commitment that you've made. And I want to also thank your family members because its not easy to see you walk out the door, to see you leave for that shift and just wait to make sure you've come home safely again. So I want to express my gratitude to your families and to everyone who love you and support you in the work that you do every single day.
You know, Harold referred to our meeting that we had on the morning of September 12. On the day before, September 11, not only our country but the entire world saw for themselves what firefighters are made of. You were the ones who ran into the fire. You were the ones who ran into the dust. Into those collapsing buildings. And for you some of your brothers and sisters it was the last time you saw them. But people who were not even on duty dropped everything they were doing to be there that day. People who didn't even work for the FDNY but who worked out on Long Island, who worked in Westchester, who worked in Connecticut, who worked in New Jersey, dropped everything they were doing. And pretty soon teams started coming from around the country. Everybody sang we want to be there, we want to watch your back, we want to help search that wreckage to see if we can find anybody still alive.
When Harold and I spoke it was a time of shock and confusion. Harold was kind enough to describe what I said to him but I want to tell you what he said to me. He said, ""We will stand with New York. Firefighters across this country and even across our border to the north will be there for you."" Well, Harold, you were true to your word. Not only you, but firefighters and paramedics and others poured into our city. You shared equipment with us; you raised money for us; you worked side by side with us. And you prayed with us. You were there when we needed you, and I want you to know that I will be there with you when you need me.
Now, we have to put this into a little bit of a context today. Because I know many of you including Harold and Vinny were perhaps a little unsure about me when I started running. Now that happens to me sometimes. In fact, you might recall, that back in 2000, you actually endorsed my opponent. But I never saw that as any kind of obstacle to working on behalf of your needs and your interests. Just as when I ran for the Senate in New York, I said I wanted to be a Senator who represented everybody, people who were for me, people who were against, people who didn't have an opinion. And I wanted to find ways we could move a common agenda forward. And of course, a crisis brought us all together. And we rolled up our sleeves. Over the years I've made wonderful friends with many of you. I was very proud in my last election to have the support of the New York firefighters. That meant the world to me because without fail, we have to stand together. We have a lot of big problems that we're facing, and I think we can once again reassert America's leadership at home, restore our values, fulfill the promise of America, and get back to leading the world in the right way. Now that starts with restoring what I call the basic bargain.
So many of us grew up with that. You know, we were raised to believe that if you worked hard and if you played by rules you'd be able to build a better life for yourself and your family. Well, I don't think in the last six years our country has actually been living up to that basic bargain. The leadership here in Washington seems to ignore middle class and hardworking families across our country. Under this president's leadership household debt has soared, healthcare costs have skyrocketed, assuming that you have it. Wages have remained stagnant. Now corporate profits are up. And productivity is up, which means Americans are working harder than anybody in the world, but we're not getting rewarded. I'll tell you who is getting rewarded. Companies like Halliburton are getting rewarded with no-bid contracts, then they move their CEOs across the ocean to another country and leave us hanging right here at home.
I'll tell you something else that we are going to have to deal with, the alternative minimum tax, which falls heavily on a lot of you and your families. You know, for six I've have been saying, with all due respect, do the billionaires in America need more tax cuts? Don't you think we ought to cut the taxes of middle income people, in particular those who are going to be hit by the alternative minimum tax?
You know, for six long years, our President has not seen the vast majority of Americans. Not our middle class, not our working families. He's looked right through them. To him, they're invisible. You know, if you're a child sitting in a crumbling school, you're invisible. If you're a small business owner who worries about energy costs or someone who can't afford to fill up your tank -- you're invisible. If you're a hardworking parent who needs affordable childcare while you go to work -- you're invisible. Even if you're a soldier returning from combat who needs healthcare and disability compensation, you are invisible. Well, those days are over.
When we look at the way our first responders have been treated, if you're paramedic who got sick after 9/11, if you're a federal firefighter who can't qualify for worker's compensation or disability retirement, if you're a retired firefighter who can't afford health insurance, well, you're invisible too. It's great for the photo ops, but how about taking care of the people who taken of us across our country!
Well I want to make clear today you're not invisible to the people of our country. And you're sure not invisible to me. And when we retake the White House, you will no longer be invisible to the President of the United States of America.
And I want to say in this public setting that when I'm in the White House I'm going to be there for you whenever you need me on whatever you need me for. Because there isn't anything more important to me than taking care of our first responders. It is part of our national security; it is part of our moral obligation.
And being there for you means continuing the fight to ensure that you have everything you need to do your job --the equipment, the people, whatever it takes. So let me tell you when George W. Bush tried to cut the funding for the Safer Act, which I co-sponsored, and the Fire Act, I took that personally. And with my colleagues, we fought him. And when he did it again, we fought him again. And I'm going to keep on fighting until FIRE and SAFER are fully funded, whatever it takes.
Now being there for you also means caring for every firefighter, every police officer, every paramedic, every volunteer or worker who has fallen ill in the aftermath of September 11. It wasn't just people from New York who responded that day and the days to follow and the months to follow. It was people from all over our country, and when I first visited the site, the afternoon of September the 12, I could barely see anything, the dark cloud was so thick. But I could smell it, I could taste it, I could feel it. As I watched the first firefighters walking out of that curtain of darkness, covered in black soot, barely able to stand, dragging their axes behind them, I knew that the effects of 9/11 would last long after September 11.
Within days the so called World Trade Center Cough began to appear. Young men and women in the prime of their lives developed asthma and bronchitis and laryngitis, and their livers were polluted and their lungs were failing. And people who, before September 11 could lift three times their body weight, could barely stand they were so bent over in pain. They couldn't sleep lying flat in their beds anymore; they had to sit up all night long. People who used to be able to run miles without stopping could no longer breathe going up a flight of stairs.
Working hand in hand with many of you and with the IAFF we created a program to screen and monitor those who were sick. And we got $90 million to expand it. And when President Bush tried to take $125 million back, we knew we had to draw the line. And you once again came in and helped us win that fight. Let's just say the president picked a fight with the wrong people. We won it but we didn't stop there. With your help I was able to introduce legislation asking for more than $1.9 billion for medical and mental health monitoring and treatment. We're going to keep working on this, not just this year or next year but as long as our first responders, our workers, our volunteers, our residents need help.
Being there for you also means getting smart about homeland security. As you know all too well, we confront a new enemy and a new kind of warfare. It's really the warfare of cowards. It's people who sneak around and blow themselves up or place bombs in cars, who have a philosophy of nihilism. You know, they may dress it up in a kind of perverse version of religion, but it's really about destruction and death. And it is imperative that we stand against them. Their warfare is not conducted by armies or navies but by criminals, by insurgents, by militias driven by this twisted hate. And it's been frustrating for many of us because we can't get the resources to match the rhetoric. We've got a lot of tough rhetoric out of Washington, but when it comes to paying overtime, getting you the equipment you need not the equipment they want to give you, providing the money directly to local communities and not passing it through the states. Well, we haven't gotten what we know you need to protect our country.
And in this latest budget, the president is proposing to cut funds for first responders at the Department of Homeland Security to the tune of $1.7 billion. The way I see it, saying you believe in homeland security without funding first responders is like saying you believe in building a hospital without doctors and nurses. If we don't fund you, we're not funding our first line of defense, and we're going to need to work together to make that happen.
And as Harold knows, and all my folks from New York know, we have been fighting for interoperable communications since September 12. We have put in legislation. We've asked for more money, but when firefighters can't talk to police officers, when emergency responders can't talk to those form another, we not only saw it on September 11, we saw it again during Hurricane Katrina. A crisis that really, once again, put firefighters in the forefront. Just think about what's happening where your brothers and sisters are trying to operate out of trailers, and they're still using ruined equipment that we still haven't replaced.
What was a natural disaster was turned into a national disgrace, and we need to get the funds directly where they are needed. And being there for you means trying to end the war in Iraq in the right way, because firefighters have fought and died in Iraq. And we were heartbroken to learn that those who had fought and had been injured were languishing in Walter Reed. I went out there a week ago Friday early in the morning to meet with a bunch of soldiers from New York. Some of them had been tied up in the bureaucratic red tape until they were just beyond words. They couldn't figure out ""what had I done to deserve this? I served my country, active duty, National Guard, or reserve. Why am I being treated like that?""
Well, the 2006 elections sent a strong message that we do not want our young men and women in uniform to be in the middle of a sectarian civil war, where they don't know who is shooting at them, and they can figure out whose side they're supposed to be on. We're trying to introduce some rationality in this, in the Congress, trying to stop the escalation because I profoundly believe that putting more of our young men and women into harm's way -- unless the Iraqis decide to defend themselves -- we cannot end this war for them. If they're not going to stand up and take responsibility, we should not lose another American life. We should end this escalation now.
I hope that the president will extricate us from Iraq before he leaves office. But let me assure you, if you doesn't, when I'm president, I will.
Being there for you means standing side by side with you in the fight for your most fundamental rights. As Harold said in his introduction, I believe that it is absolutely essential to the way America works that people be given the right to organize and bargain collectively. Nearly 90 years ago, when 36 delegates gathered for the first IAFF convention, 84 hours work-weeks were the norm, and terrible conditions were a fact of life. You know why that's no longer the case? Because of you. You organized, you unionized, you stood up for your rights. You said, ""We're not going to be invisible. We're doing our part. You have to give us safe working conditions, fair treatment, and the right to bargain.""
But some people still don't get it. You know they say that collective bargaining will undermine our national security. They think you haven't earned the right to organize. You know what I say to them? I say, ""Would you change places? Would you go into that fire? Would you stand on those collapsing floors and under those crumbling ceilings? Well the way I see it, when you plunge head first into burning buildings for a living, you have more than earned the right to organize for better conditions on the job.""
Make no mistake about it, the days of George Bush thinking the union bug is something he needs to squash are over. We are here to stand up for the rights of people who pull children out of raging waters and rescue people from flaming rooftops. We are here to stand up for the people who stand up for us. We have a lot of work head of us, and we could get some small victories along the way until we finally get the majorities we need to completely have an agenda that we support in the Senate. They can still stop a lot of what we believe in, unfortunately, but we just have to keep electing more people who see the world the way we do. And we certainly will make a lot more progress when we take back the White House.
Back after the days of September 11, so many of you came to me and said that the families of firefighters who had been killed were confronting piles of paperwork just to get the benefits they were owed. They were told it would take weeks or months, and the families didn't have that kind of time. So again, working with Harold and his team, we put together a bill, and my friend Jerry Nadler sponsored it in the House, and within a week that bill passed into law. And when the bill passed, we didn't declare victory or do some kind of big celebration, because the truth is, in the end, there was nothing we could do to give back to those families the people they had loved and lost. All we could do is to come together as a team and help as best we could. And in the end, we just followed the basic rule you live by: you never leave a brother or sister behind. Well that's how I've tried to serve in the Senate. That's how I've tried to set my priorities, and I want you to know that, if I do have the honor and the opportunity to be your president, that's what I will continue to do.
Now, people who know me will tell you I don't back down from a fight. And others use more colorful language sometimes about me. But that's just fine with me. I don't care what they say; I just care about what we do. That is what is important to me. And because I'm proud to fight for you because you fight for us, I'm going to stay on your side. I'm not in any way concerned by the fight we have ahead because I know we can win this fight. I know that if we stand together, we get our message out to America. If we steel ourselves to all of the criticism and the counter-attacks and the stereotypes and everything that they'll put out, then we'll be victorious. I have a little experience at staying the course and in sticking with people who stick with me.
St. Augustine said a long time ago that hope is really the combination of two things. It's a combination of anger at the way things are and courage to change the way things are. Well, living by hope and understanding, we can't be satisfied by what we see before us on homeland security or collective bargaining. But having the courage to step out and try to make a different future is one of reasons why I admire what you have done over the course of your work on behalf of firefighters. And I am thrilled and honored to stand with you, and together, we will make it clear that those of us who believe that courage and anger about what is, leads to hope, means that we will change America for the better.
Thank you all so much, and God bless you for everything you do. Thank you, take care.
","Remarks at the International Association of Fire Fighters Bipartisan 2008 Presidential Forum in Washington, DC",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-international-association-fire-fighters-bipartisan-2008-presidential-forum
James Brokenshire,United Kingdom,2018-10-01,"Thank you to Shazia for your kind words of introduction.
Shazia is a great example of Conservatives making a difference in local government and making a difference in the communities they serve.
Thank you for your public service and all that you do.
Can I also introduce my fantastic team at the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government.
My ministers Kit Malthouse, Jake Berry, Rishi Sunak, Heather Wheeler and Nigel Adams. Our tireless PPSs Chris Philp and Leo Docherty and our whip Jeremy Quin.
Friends, it’s been quite a year for me and today is a particular personal milestone.
When I addressed our Conference twelve months ago, I didn’t know it, but I had lung cancer.
In some of my darker moments earlier this year, I questioned whether I would be here at all – let alone fit, well and able to speak on this stage today.
When you receive a cancer diagnosis… when you are forced to confront your own mortality head on… it makes you appreciate what’s important… what makes life worth living.
I know I couldn’t have got through this period without the incredible love and support of my wife Cathy and our three children, Sophie, Jemma and Ben.
They’ve kept me positive, they’ve helped get me through surgery, through my recovery and back to strength.
But I also know that if it wasn’t for our amazing NHS I wouldn’t be here today.
They saved my life and in some way will have touched the lives of every person in this hall.
To all those who work in our NHS – thank you.
You are amazing and we pay tribute to all that you do.
Now I may be part of one lung lighter, but it hasn’t diminished my passion for our party, my pride in our country and my earnest belief that our best days lie ahead of us and not behind us.
That is what makes us Conservatives.
And a key part of this is building the homes our country needs.
The Prime Minister is right in seeing this as our biggest domestic priority.
And I am proud to serve alongside her to meet the challenges of our time and harness the opportunities of the future.
We must respond to the uncomfortable truth that through decades of under-investment and lack of political will for too many a home of your own is unaffordable and out of reach.
Everyone deserves a decent, affordable and secure place to call home.
When a generation is locked out of the housing market it hurts us as a country.
It’s the impact it has on the lives of individuals and their families.
It’s about social justice, opportunity and building a fairer, stronger Britain.
A Britain where ‘Generation Rent’ can become ‘Generation Own’.
A Britain where we turn the vision of a place you call home into a reality.
The last time a Government committed to building 300,000 homes a year was in 1951 when Harold Macmillan was Conservative Housing Minister.
Super Mac did it then and we will do it again.
We will build 300,000 homes a year by the mid 2020’s.
And we have made an important start.
Since 2010 one point one million new homes built.
Nearly half a million families are now home owners thanks to Help to Buy and Right to Buy.
And a million first time buyers are expected to benefit from our cuts to stamp duty with 80% of first time buyers paying no stamp duty at all.
If you aspire to own your own home then I want to say this to you.
We will help you.
We will build the homes our country needs.
We will support you to save for your deposit.
We will break down the barriers standing between you and the opportunities you deserve.
We will fix our broken housing market and make it work for you.
As for Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party they may have given the Red Flag a reboot, but it’s the same old socialism that brought our country to its knees and would do so again.
Under the last Labour government house building fell to levels not seen since the 1920’s.
The number of first time buyers collapsed by over 50%.
Housing became more unaffordable, not less.
Labour doesn’t believe in increasing home ownership.
They would suspend Right to Buy and shatter people’s hopes and dreams of the chance to buy their own home.
It’s same old story from the same Old Labour.
No matter what they say, you know we’ll all have to pay.
But I know that there is much more to do to get the homes we need built.
We need to be bold and radical to remove unnecessary barriers and speed up delivery.
And in doing so we need a reformed planning system that is effective and responsive.
In July I published the new planning rule book.
It provides greater certainty and clarity for developers and communities alike.
To know the requirements and expectations and encourage a plan led approach to development.
Strengthening the protections for our environment and our precious Green Belt.
But we need to be smarter on how we use land and the space available.
Prioritising brownfield but also looking at land that’s already been built on.
That’s why I will publish proposals to permit people to build up on existing buildings rather than build out to use more precious land.
And give Councils greater powers to deliver the garden communities of the future.
But it’s not just about getting homes built – it’s about fairness.
Some practices in the leasehold market – such as unexpected costs that rise every year and bear no relation to services – can turn a homeowner’s dream into a nightmare.
That’s why we’re banning the unjustified use of leaseholds on new houses and limiting future ground rents for long leases to a peppercorn.
But we also need to address quality issues in new homes too.
That’s why I can announce today the creation of a New Homes Ombudsman.
This new watchdog will champion home buyers, protect their interests and hold developers to account.
And give confidence that when you get the keys to a new home you get the quality build you expect and the finish you’ve paid for.
Getting a fair deal extends to private renters too.
We’ve created a Rogue Landlords database to identify the worst offenders.
We are banning unfair letting agent fees being passed onto tenants.
And Capped deposit costs too.
Fairness also needs to be felt by people living in social housing.
That’s why I want to see a new deal for social housing tenants.
To deliver decent homes, strengthen redress and break unjustified stigma.
Equally as Conservatives we are committed to supporting the most vulnerable in our society.
It is simply unacceptable in modern Britain that there are still people living out on our streets with no roof over their head.
Our rough sleeping strategy and rough sleeping initiative are focusing efforts to drive change to give support to those most in need.
So that we end rough sleeping for good.
Most profoundly though, people should be safe in their own homes.
It’s been over a year since the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire.
This unimaginable horror has rightly shocked us all and underlined the need to do all that we can to see that such a disaster cannot happen again.
My work with Grenfell United and the wider community has been hugely helpful in keeping this issue right at the top of the government’s agenda.
And that is why today I can confirm that I will change the building regulations to ban the use of combustible materials for all new high rise residential buildings, hospitals, registered care homes and student accommodation.
And bring about a change in culture on building safety.
In advancing our ambitious housing agenda we need to create strong, prosperous, confident communities socially and economically.
Giving a sense of identity, a sense of place and an affinity to the places where we live, where we work, where we spend our time.
Communities where we recognise diversity and heritage.
How this makes us stronger;
How we all have so much more in common than divides us.
We have to defend the civility of civil society against hatred and separation.
We have to be robust in challenging anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim hatred and division based on religion, heritage or background.
There is no place in our country for bigotry and intolerance.
And as Conservatives we will stand up against this in all its forms.
At the heart of our communities are our towns and high streets.
Our high streets are the beating heart of a local economy.
And local businesses are their lifeblood.
That’s why I’m proud that we’ve launched the Great British High Street Competition.
To recognise, to champion and to celebrate innovation and success.
But we know technology is changing the way we live our lives and the challenges this brings.
I look forward to receiving the work of our new high streets advisory panel led by Sir John Timpson.
So that we can take further action to support our high streets and help them continue to do what they do best.
I know that so much local success relies on the dedication and hard work of Conservatives in local government around the country.
I want to thank all of our Councillors who work tirelessly for their communities.
It’s because of you people understand that with a Conservative council you get quality services and lower taxes.
We asked Conservative councils to help fix the mess left by the last Labour government and they delivered.
In return we’ve devolved power, localised business rates, created a swathe of city region mayors, founded Local Enterprise Partnerships, kick started local industrial strategies.
Through the fair funding review and business rate retention we have the opportunity to drive further change, to support innovation and get the very best from local government.
But I know an ageing population and growing demand are creating real pressures on public services.
Health and social care are inextricably linked and any reforms must be aligned.
That’s why I’m working with Matt Hancock – recognising local government’s direct interests – towards the publication of the Social Care Green Paper.
This will include plans to reform social care, provide better integration of services and put the care system on a long term sustainable footing.
As we leave the EU we should be confident and positive about the potential of each part of our country and the contribution they can make to drive our future prosperity.
Through the Northern Powerhouse, the Midlands Engine and Silicon Vale linking Oxford, Cambridge and Milton Keynes.
Through City Deals and Local Growth Funds.
Through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund supporting continued regional investment.
Helping deliver a country that works for everyone.
And we will harness the opportunities that are presented to us.
In 2022 Birmingham will host the Commonwealth Games.
It will provide the platform for this great city to shine on a global stage.
The chance to drive economic potential.
The chance to create a sense of pride – not just in this city but our country as a whole.
That’s why I’m proud today to announce the Government funding for the construction of the Athletes Village.
We will invest £165 million to help support the delivery of 5,100 new homes, but just as importantly create a long lasting legacy for Birmingham and from the Commonwealth Games.
And this is part of our Conservative mission.
To create a legacy.
A legacy of new homes and communities for your children and mine.
To show, that to be Conservative is to want to build for the future not turn away from it, and in doing so draw on our traditions, history and knowledge.
Whether through new homes, villages, towns, cities or communities, we Conservatives are working to build a new Britain.
A people reconnected to our nation with renewed pride and energy.
Optimistic and hopeful for the future.
Because the nation we are building is one where opportunity is for all and no one is left behind.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2016-09-01,"Thank you all so much. What an honor and a privilege to speak today to the American Legion.
I thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers. You have all done such an incredible job.
The men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America. Strength, courage, selfless devotion. Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism -- not Globalism.
We are in your debt.
I will never let you down.
Together, we are going to work on so many shared goals. But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.
In A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.
We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.
We will be united by our common culture, values and principles -- becoming One American Nation.
One country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.
The flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.
That flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag -- and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
In addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.
We will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will do it based on those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.
We will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world -- and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.
That will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.
I've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website. Here are the basics:
I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.
The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans -- not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.
I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.
I will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.
We are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.
The Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust. But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.
That means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice -- whatever is fastest and best for the veteran. The Veteran will be in control.
Should I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again. We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security -- and our border.
I just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country -- including to our Armed Services.
I want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.
We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.
We also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere. A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.
When I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers. We will fight for every last American job.
We're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.
We are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores -- and unleash an American Energy Revolution.
We will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.
I will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.
Above all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies. We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy -- joined by our partners in the Middle East -- that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism. We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.
At the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country. That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees. My opponent wants a 550% increase. I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas -- and use the money saved to invest in America.
It is time to create a New American Future -- for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.
In this future, we will have an honest government -- and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play. Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.
We will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget -- no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.
It will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country -- including our inner cities. We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a great job.
We will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.
Ladies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote. Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.
We will make America Strong Again.
We will Make America Proud Again.
We will Make America Safe Again.
We will Make America Great Again.
Thank you, and God bless.
",Prepared Remarks: Donald Trump at the American Legion in Cincinnati OH,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-prepared-remarks-cincinnati-oh-september-1-2016
Barack Obama,United States of America,2009-01-09,"Good morning. 
Before I discuss today’s announcement, I’d like to say a few words about the latest jobs numbers that we received this morning.
Yesterday, I spoke about the need to pass the America Recovery and Reinvestment Plan so that we can jumpstart job creation, invest in our future, and lay a foundation for long-term economic growth. This morning, we received a stark reminder about how urgently action is needed.
524,000 jobs were lost in December across nearly all major American industries. That means that our economy lost jobs in all 12 months of 2008, and that nearly 2.6 million jobs lost last year amount to the single worst year of job loss since World War II. The unemployment rate is now well over 7 percent. In addition, we have 3.4 million people who want full-time work but are only able to get part-time work. Clearly, the situation is dire; it is deteriorating, and it demands urgent and immediate action.
My staff and I have been engaged in a constructive dialogue with members of Congress over the last few days and weeks about my American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan which will save or create 3 million jobs, and make long-term investments in critical areas like energy, health care, and education. We've made good progress in these consultations, and I look forward to working closely with Congress to shape legislation that will work for the American people.
Now I’d like to say a few words about today’s appointments. Over the past few weeks, Vice President-Elect Biden and I have been working with our national security appointees so that we’re ready to hit the ground running on January 20th. Today, I’m pleased to complete our team by announcing my choices to lead the intelligence community and the CIA.
The men and women of the intelligence community have been on the front lines in this world of new and evolving dangers. They've served in the shadows, saved American lives, advanced our interests, and earned the respect of a grateful nation. There have been sound reforms and many successes to built over the last several years.
But here in Washington, we've also learned some tough lessons. We've learned that to make pragmatic policy choices, we must insist on assessments grounded solely on the facts, and not seek information to suit any ideological agenda. To support those who carry out our intelligence mission, we must give them the resources they need and the clear guidance they deserve. And we know that to be truly secure, we must adhere to our values as vigilantly as we protect our safety -- with no exceptions.
I am confident that Dennis Blair and Leon Panetta are the right leaders to advance the work of our intelligence community. They are public servants with unquestioned integrity, broad experience, strong management skills, and the core pragmatism we need in dangerous times. Together, they will form a team that is uniquely qualified to continue the good work that is being done, while making the changes we need to stay ahead of nimble threats and sustain the trust of the American people.
Admiral Dennis Blair has seen the diverse uses of intelligence from many different perspectives. Over several decades in uniform, he learned firsthand the necessity of good intelligence for our men and women in uniform. As Commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, he developed a deep understanding of the critical importance of Asia, and carried out a major offensive against violent extremists. And as a former NF--NSC staffer and the first Associate Director of Central Intelligence for Military Support, he is uniquely qualified to bridge -- to build bridges of cooperation among our national security institutions.
As DNI, Dennis will be the leader and manager of our intelligence community. He will have my full support as he develops our capabilities, strengthens information gathering and sharing, enhances cooperation with foreign governments, and provides policymakers with the information we need -- even if it’s not always the information that we want. As someone who has handled intelligence as a sailor at -- at sea and strategic thinker in Washington, he will have the expertise and authority to ensure that our 16 intelligence agencies act with unity of effort and of purpose.
Admiral Blair’s experience will be exceptionally complemented by Leon Panetta, my choice to be director of the CIA. Leon is one of the finest public servants of our time, and he's committed himself to his country since he put on the uniform of the United States Army. As a Congressman, OMB Director, and White House Chief of Staff, he has unparalleled experience in making the institutions of government work better for the American people. He has handled intelligence daily at the very highest levels, and time and again he has demonstrated sound judgment, grace under fire, and complete integrity.
I will also rely on the talent and expertise of several distinguished public servants with substantial intelligence experience. The current DNI, Mike McConnell, will continue to offer his counsel through my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. The National Counter-Terrorism Center -- the hub of our efforts to prevent attacks and root out terrorist networks -- will continue to benefit from the leadership of Michael Leiter. And I’m pleased to announce that John Brennan -- a close advisor, CIA veteran, and former leader of the National Counter-Terrorism Center-- will be my Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor for Counterterrorism, serving with the rank of Assistant to the President.John has the experience, vision, and integrity to advance America’s security.
The demands on the intelligence community are huge and growing. To have a successful and sustainable national security strategy, I've made clear that we will need to deploy and balance all elements of American power -- our military, diplomacy, homeland security, economic might, and moral suasion. Good intelligence work is necessary to support each of these endeavors.
Right now, there are men and women working around the world to bear this burden. We may never know their names, but we will always honor -- always honor their sacrifice. The task for the team that I've assembled is to guide, support, and integrate their efforts so that we protect our security and safeguard the values that all of us have pledged to uphold.
With that, I would like to give Admiral Blair an opportunity to say a few words.
And it's an honor to lead the U.S. intelligence services. As you stated so well, Mr. President, the American people do not always know about these thousands of men and women who serve with patriotism, with dedication, but without public recognition. They're outstanding public servants.
And we in that group will -- will perform out duties fully, and capably, and according to law. We will uphold the standards that you articulated, and that the American people have a right to expect. You've made it very clear, sir, that you are best served by hearing different perspectives, and by respectful debate. And the intelligence services will support you with facts, interpretations, assessments, in a straightforward manner. And we will tell you how well we know what we know, and, what we don't know. So I deeply appreciate the opportunity to lead our intelligence services, and if confirmed by the Senate, I look forward to joining the national security team. 
And as President-Elect Obama has said, Leon Panetta's achievements have been remarkable. His services at the top level of the Executive Branch and in the Congress combine leadership and wisdom, and in this business we will count on him for both. I could not ask for a better leader of the Central Intelligence Agency, one of the key agencies within our intelligence community. Leon with your skill and background, the skill of professionals on your team, the agency is in superb hands, and so I welcome your counsel and support as together we seek to serve the President.
Thank you.
Particularly at a time when our national security is threatened, I believe it is important to respond again to this call to duty like so many other brave Americans have done. And it's because of them that I will work tirelessly to defend this nation and to provide you, Mr. President-Elect, with the most accurate and objective intelligence that you need to lead this nation, at a time of great peril but also a time of great opportunity.
The Central Intelligence Agency has a rich and proud history. As you reference, the professionals at CIA serve bravely around the world, many in dangerous places and away from their families, often under cover, sometimes under fire. They are the front line of our defense at a very dangerous time, and they deserve, and will have, my complete confidence and support.
Strong intelligence requires a strong team, and I look forward to working with Admiral Blair, with John Brennan, as well as the other many talented and dedicated men and women of our intelligence community. And I look forward to working with the other members of your Administration, particularly those involved with the national security. And I commit to consulting closely with my former colleagues in the Congress to form the kind of partnership we need, if we're to win the war on terror.
",Announcement of Key Leaders of the National Intelligence Community,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamamintelligenceteam.htm
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-10-03,"…a lot of work on health care. We’re very successful at it. And so we’re going to be speaking to the great people of Florida and I think they’re very happy with the job we’re doing. Yeah?
What?
Well, if you’re looking at the whistleblower’s complaint it’s totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect and most people that have read it say the same thing. The whistleblower never saw the conversation, he got his information, I guess, second or third hand he wrote something that was total fiction. And now when people see that they’re not happy.
Well, we’re looking at a lot of different things. China’s coming in next week, we’re going to have a meeting with them. We’ll see. But we’re doing very well. Some of the numbers, I think, are being affected by all of the nonsense, all of the politics going on in this country by the Democrats. I call them the “do nothing’s;” they do nothing for this country. They don’t care about this country, but the numbers really are looking very good going into the future. So, we’ll see. I have a lot of options on China, but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power.
Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, that sort of major investigation into the bias, it’s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Biden’s because how does a company that’s newly formed and all these companies did you look at … and by the way, likewise, China just started an investigation into the Biden’s because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with with Ukraine.
So, I would say that president Zelinsky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Biden’s because nobody has any doubt that they weren’t crooked. That was a crooked deal. 100%. He had no knowledge of energy, didn’t know the first thing about it. All of a sudden he’s getting $50,000 a month plus a lot of other things. Nobody has any doubt. And they got rid of a prosecutor who was a very tough prosecutor. They got rid of them. Now they’re trying to make it the opposite way, but they got rie- So, if I were the president, I would certainly recommend that of Ukraine.
I haven’t, but certainly something we can start thinking about because I’m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars is taken out of his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy. He got kicked out of the Navy. All of the sudden he’s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a pay off.
Well, I leave that to the lawyers. I can say though, that Schiff has now been proven to be a liar. We’ve known it for three years because they’ve been trying to impeach for three years. He’s a lie- He’s just stone cold liar. So, I leave that to the lawyers. That’s up to them to decide. But the whole investigation is crumbling. Yeah?
I can. Yeah, I can. I can.
I can.
We have a real problem. We’ve been hitting the Taliban very, very hard. And as far as I’m concerned, they still haven’t recovered from killing 12 people, one who happened to be a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and they still have not recovered and they probably never will.
No. But I read Mitch McConnell’s statement yesterday and he read my phone call and as you know, he put out his statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he’s read. And I spoke to him about it, too. He read my phone call with the President of Ukraine, Mitch McConnell. He said that was the most innocent phone call that I’ve read. I mean, give me a break. Anybody that reads it says the same thing. And the only people that don’t understand it is when they look at the false, fabricated, fraudulent statement made by shifty Schiffs.
Well, I think Biden is going down and I think his whole situation, because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine and basically who are they really scamming? The USA and it’s not good.
And that’s probably why China, for so many years, has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the USA because they deal like people with Biden where they give their son a billion and a half dollars. And that’s probably why China has such a sweetheart deal that for so many years they’ve been ripping off our guns.
We’re looking at it. We’re looking at it very closely. It’s under study.
We’ll see. They want to talk and we’ll be talking to him, too. We’ll see.
I’m going to … Yes?
I heard very bad things about her and I don’t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her, but I heard very, very bad things about it for a long period of time. Not good.
Thank you. I’ll see you in Florida. I’ll see you all in Florida.
",Trump Transcript: Trump Says China Should Investigate Biden,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-transcript-trump-says-china-should-investigate-biden
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-04-30,"Okay. Thank you very much. It’s an honor to be with governor Phil Murphy, a wonderful state known as New Jersey. I spent a lot of time in New Jersey. It’s a beautiful state. People don’t realize how dense it is, right?
Keep saying, I guess you’re number two and I’ve even heard number one right?
Nobody would think that about New Jersey, but it’s a great place in a great state and they have a wonderful man that’s running it. He runs it with heart and with brains and he’s done a terrific job. We are together. We are working closely. I think we … Somebody said we got you more ventilators maybe than any other state, which surprised me also. But you’ve used them well.
And your numbers are headed in the right direction and I just want to thank the governor and his very capable people. The relationship’s been a very good one and we’re working very hard with New Jersey. We’re working hard with everybody, but we’re working hard with this governor. He’s one of the governors that’s really done a job. He stepped up to the plate and he swung and you’re going to see the results very soon. So with that I’d like to ask Phil, perhaps you’d like to say a few words.
Thank you very much. And we have been helping other hospitals and you know, hospitals have been really under a stress to put it mildly, right?
You know, you have some hospitals where you don’t have such a big COVID problem and they do what they do. In fact, they really could do a lot more because they weren’t allowed to use the elective. And by not having the elective, all of a sudden they had such a different situation from you. Of course you had to use it for COVID and it, it was a tremendous strain. So we’re going to work with you on that. We have been, but we’re going to be working again then I just want to thank you for the great job you’ve done. Thank you mister president. And likewise, thank you for your partnership and leadership on this. It’s meant an enormous amount of our state. Thank you very much. And I have to speak as president, but I also speak with somebody that is in New Jersey a lot. It’s a great place. It’s a beautiful state. People don’t understand New Jersey quite, but it’s a beautiful state and it’s great to have you as the governor.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. And by the way, he’s a Democrat, so I’m getting myself in trouble, but that’s okay. I have to tell the truth. He’s something. So any questions? Jim?
Well, I think we’re going to have a great third quarter. That’s going to be a transition. So when I say great, I think the transition is going to be really terrific and we’re going to take it into the fourth and I think we’re going to have potentially a great fourth quarter. There’s tremendous pent up demand. I don’t know if Kevin said that or Larry Kudlow, but the telling, they see it, but I feel it. I feel it. I think sometimes what I feel is better than what I think, unfortunately, or fortunately felt. But I tell you what, I feel it and I will say that I think next year is going to be a spectacular year in terms of growth, in terms of bringing our country back. I think we’re going to have a really good year. We want to be where we were and I think we can actually surpass where we were and we were the strongest anywhere in the world.
We were the best that we ever were, but we were the strongest anywhere in the world. But I view what we have now as obviously a period of here we are, it is what it is. We just got hit by a vicious virus that should have never been allowed to escape China. They should have stopped it at the source. They didn’t do that. 184 countries have been devastated by it, including China, by the way, because I looked at their numbers and their numbers are terrible and it’s just a very tough situation for the people of our country. All the loss, the death, it’s a terrible thing, but I think we’re going to make a very strong comeback. It’ll start with the third quarter. I think you’re going to see some pretty good numbers. I think you’re going to see really good transition numbers, but the fourth quarter is going to be … I really believe it’s going to be terrific. And I think that next year is going to be a great year.
Sure, I think they do. I think they have to do a number of things. They do have to do that and maybe Phil could speak to that because I think I’ve handled it … And not me. I think our whole group has been spectacular. We had ventilators, we didn’t have any, we built them. We have thousands, tens of thousands right now under construction and we’ve given, as Phil said, you’ve got I think more ventilators than anybody in the United States, New Jersey needed them very badly.
And there was never a person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get one in any state, not one person that needed a ventilator. So we didn’t say he didn’t get a ventilator and somebody passed away, somebody didn’t make it. Now we had a mask problem. Now we have so many masks, we don’t know what to do with them. We had a big problem and you have to understood, we took over the cupboards were bare. And the thing that, frankly, it’s not as tough as the ventilator situation, we’re the king of ventilators, but what we have done is on testing with billing numbers, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before.
I told you the president of South Korea, President Moon called me to congratulate me on testing. And we did more tests than any other country anywhere in the world. And I think they told me yesterday a number, if you add up the rest of the world, we’ve done more testing, and it’s a higher quality test. So I think we’ve done a … I think the whole team, federal government, we built hospitals for you and others. We built medical centers and I’m talking about thousands and thousands of beds, many, many medical centers. We had, as you know, we had the governor of Florida, the governor of Louisiana over the last two days.
They could not have been … And one was a Democrat and this gentleman happens to be a proud Democrat. They could not have been more supportive of the effort of the federal government. And I’ll tell you, Jim, let me just tell you we have … We started off with empty cupboards. The last administration left us nothing. We started off with bad broken tests and obsolete tests, we’ve come up with, between the Abbott Laboratories, we have the five minutes. Did they test you today?
Now I feel better.
You did the five minute, the Abbott test?
You know what? That’s a brand new test. That didn’t exist eight weeks ago and now it’s like the rage. Everybody wants that test. No, I think we’ve done … I think we’ve done a really great job.
Well, I know Jim, let me just say-
Jim, we had broken tests. We had tests that were absolutely, we had tests that didn’t take care of people. But here’s what’s very important. If you take a look at the swine flu, H1N1 or as Joe Biden would say N1H1, but it’s actually wrong. He didn’t even know the name. Okay? H1N1, the swine flu. The Obama administration was a disaster and they did polling on how did they do and their polls was so negative, so bad. They did a very poor job and they did a poor jo on a lot of things. They did a poor job on our military, they did a poor job on our ammunition. When I got here, we had no ammunition. Just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical too.
So I think when you ask how did we do, and I have to say it because the news is so fake and so corrupt, I think we did a spectacular job. I’m not even referring to me. I’m referring to all of these people, including your people who have been working with my people so closely, but the federal government has done a spectacular job to a point where we’re building now, we’re going to have thousands and thousands of ventilators and we’re helping other countries because Phil doesn’t need ventilators. You needed them very badly in the beginning.
And maybe you could say something to Jim’s question.
Right.
And Phil how did we do on ventilators as an example where you were really … You needed them badly.
Thank you, Phil.
No, I’m not over promising. I don’t know who said it, but whatever the maximum is, whatever you can humanly do, we’re going to have and we hope we’re going to come up with a good vaccine. Johnson and Johnson and Oxford and lots of different great companies, representatives of our country in some ways, NIH is working very hard and doing a terrific job. No, I hope we’re going to have a vaccine and we’re going to fast track it like you’ve never seen before. If we come up with a vaccine, I think they probably will.
We have … You know who’s in charge of it honestly? I am. I’ll tell you, I’m really in charge of it. I could say somebody else. I will say what dealing with, as you know, the general and the admiral, they’re very much in charge, but I think probably more than anything, I’m in charge and I’m the one that gets blamed and I get blamed anyway. Don’t forget, if we come up with a vaccine in record time, they’ll say I should have done it faster, but we have a lot of good possibilities like the Gilead yesterday, that was a big thing. That was a big thing and as explained, and I think very importantly that was a step, that was a big step, 31% step. But the step means, I guess Deborah with Tony yesterday was explaining, the step means you now take another step, another, all of a sudden you’re up to 50, 60, 70 but that was a very positive, it was a big step, as I understand it.
Go ahead please. Yeah, Jeff go.
Well, I haven’t seen the report yet, but I will tell you if you speak to the head of intelligence right now, you speak to the head. They did say that I was given a briefing when I said I was given it, not before. And they also said that it wasn’t specific and it was not a panic briefing. It wasn’t like, “Oh, we’re going to be invaded.” It was in January, later January. And I think what you’ll do is you’ll speak to them. In fact, I’ll ask Mark to make a report to you because the news was totally, as usual, fake and corrupt. So intelligence is doing a report and the report turned out to be exactly as I said.
No, I’m not saying it. I’m not. You didn’t hear me. I said intelligence is saying it and they’re going to give a report and it will make you very unhappy because it makes you so wrong. You in particular. Go ahead. Behind you please, please.
And we did.
I will say that’s a tough question because you’re talking about the states and whether you call it a bailout or a lot of money and a lot of it’s for years long before you were there. You can’t have a better representative than this man, that I can tell you. Plus he’s an old Goldman Sachs guy. And what they don’t know about him, he’s done a great job, but he went through a big operation just before this happened and that’s a hell of a thing.
That was a big deal.
No, not at all. No. We solved that problem. We solved that problem yesterday. I expect to see the supply chain as strong as ever. Maybe stronger for certain reasons. We did something, we got … We had a roadblock though, it was a legal roadblock more than anything else. It was a foolish thing that nobody ever took care of for a long time and we took care of it. No, I expect things to go very smoothly.
Not even a little bit. There’s a lot of supply too, but now they’re going to get it. And that was solved yesterday very late in the evening. Okay?
Well, we’re talking about that I know a lot of people are talking about it, but we’ve given a lot of stimulus and, again, we think now it’s, it’s so great. I’m so happy that you’re opening up parks and things because that’s a big step for New Jersey because they were hit very hard. I think you’re going to see something that’s going to surprise maybe the world. We’re the leader of the world. We’re really the leader in this case, the leader of the world. And we’ve done better. If you look at our deaths, if you look at mortality rates, if you look at the things.
In fact, I’m going to get a chart because it’s maybe the most impressive thing, right? How we’ve done, and that’s a tribute to the governors and its a tribute to the federal government and all of us working together. I would love you to get that if you could, because we’re right at the top, meaning top in a positive way of of those charts. I think you’re going to see economic numbers that are going to be fantastic. I believe it very strongly and you’re going to start to see it with the transition period, which is number three and quarter four, you’re going to have tremendous numbers, you’re going to have tremendous numbers, and I think next year you’re going to really have tremendous numbers.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I tell you, sure. When I looked at what they did to him, they tormented him. Dirty cops tormented General Flynn. General Flynn is a fine man. 35 years or so in the military. You don’t get to be where he is by being bad. That I can tell you. And then right at the beginning of the administration, the dirty cops came in and you’ve seen the notes, Jim. I mean whether you’re on our side, that side, whatever, I mean I assume, let’s all talk about fairness. What they did to General Flynn, and by the way to Roger Stone and to others was a disaster and it would disgrace and it should never be allowed to happen in this country again. And what I really hoped, because CNN tormented him in all fairness, I really hope to see, because they haven’t been doing it. And I appreciate your question. I hope to see that CNN will not even apologize, which they should, but just cover it fairly because he’s in the process of being exonerated.
If you look at those notes from yesterday, that was total exoneration. These were dirty, filthy cops at the top of the FBI. And you know the names better than I do, and they were dishonest people. Now we have to see what’s going to happen. But General Flynn was treated like nobody should. And I’m not talking about generals, I’m saying like nobody at this country should be treated. And they did it right at the beginning. They did it right-
Well, look at what they did to the guy. I mean he couldn’t have known too much what was happening. They came at him with 15 buses and he’s standing in the middle of a highway. What they did to this man, they tormented him. They destroyed him. But he’s going to come back, like I say, he’s going to come back bigger and better. But what they did to him, and I hear there’s a lot of other stuff coming out if I believe everything I’m reading because I like to stay out of it. I don’t have to stay out of it at all, but I like to stay out of it. And Jim, what they did to him is terrible and I hope that CNN is going to give them a fair shake and cover it because I think it’s very important. Yes?
Well, what I wish I had was all the information where they were out to get him. They wanted him … They were trying to force him to lie. You see the written statements where they were trying to force him into a position where we can get them on a lie or can we get them this way or that way? This is terrible. This is like what happened in, and I’m not going to name the countries because we deal with these countries. Okay. But what would happen in other countries, not the USA.
What they did to General Flynn and others and others is a disgrace. And I hope really, I hope your networks are going to cover it because I’ve seen where it’s the biggest story in the world a year ago in a year and a year and half, Flynn, Flynn, Flynn, and then he’s essentially exonerated. Now, that’s not official yet. But when you read the notes, how could you do anything else. I think it would be so good for CNN if you covered it honestly, and if you reported honestly, that would be so good for the network. Okay, with that, thank you all very much. Thank you Jim.
",Donald Trump & NJ Governor Phil Murphy Meeting Transcript on Coronavirus,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nj-governor-phil-murphy-meeting-transcript-on-coronavirus
Abraham Lincoln,United States of America,1861-03-04 00:00:00,"Fellow citizens of the United States: In compliance with a custom as old as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the President ""before he enters on the execution of his office.""I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement. Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that ""I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I beheve I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."" Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them. And, more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes. I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause -- as cheerfully to one section as to another. There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions: No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due. It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution -- to this provision as much as to any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause ""shall be delivered up,"" their oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done. And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that ""the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.""I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules. And while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional. It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our National Constitution. During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the executive branch of the government. They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted. I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure forever -- it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself. Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate it -- break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that, in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was ""to form a more perfect Union.""But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity. It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself. In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere. Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices. The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections. That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them. To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from -- will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution -- certainly would if such a right were a vital one. But such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guarantees and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration. No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left. I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. One section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived, without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the National Constitution amended. While I make no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution -- which amendment, however, I have not seen -- has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the States. The people themselves can do this also if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor. Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American people. By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years. My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty. In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to ""preserve, protect, and defend it.""I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
",First Inaugural Address,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-03-24,"Good morning everyone.
I apologize for being a little delayed this morning. It was important that I speak with all three opposition leaders because I’m unable to join them this afternoon as the House of Commons reconvenes to pass emergency legislation on COVID-19.
This legislation will help ensure that Canadians are getting the support they need during these challenging times.
No matter who you are, where you live, or what you do – COVID-19 is having a real impact on your life.
Small businesses are temporarily closing up shop. Hotels and restaurants can no longer accept guests.
Some people are not getting paid. Others are worried about their job.
Whatever your situation may be, our government is here to help.
Passing this bill today means getting you the support you deserve as soon as possible.
When you’re trying to help get money out to people, speed is of the essence, especially in an unprecedented situation like this one.
But I want to make it very clear — I believe in our democratic institutions.
All of us in Parliament must work together and Canadians need to see us doing just that.
So, you have my unwavering commitment.
We will protect and uphold our democratic values.
We will protect and uphold our democratic institutions as we deliver support to Canadians as quickly as possible.
Today, the House of Commons will return to adopt the emergency measures that our government has announced.
This is a very important step in giving Canadians the support they deserve.
I know that people have a lot of questions about the next steps and, as I have said from the start, all levels of government are working day and night to get you answers.
The federal assistance we announced last week for workers and businesses is coming.
At the same time, we are also continuing to think about other ways to help Canadians.
What we have announced to date is a start, but our work is ongoing.
From the beginning, science and experts have guided our approach and our response to the crisis. And science and experts must continue to guide us through what lies ahead.
As the situation evolves, we are discovering what more we must do, what we must do better, and we’re adjusting.
We will have more information and more support for Canadians in the coming days, but in the meantime, know that the entire public service is working non-stop to support you.
I want to thank all public servants—not just at the federal level, but at the provincial, territorial, and municipal levels—for all of their work.
I know a lot of Canadians abroad are still having trouble finding a flight to bring them home, so I want to give everyone an update.
At least one more flight from Morocco has been scheduled.
The first flight from Peru will leave today and we’re working on flights from Panama, Tunisia, Ukraine in addition to the flights we’ve already announced from Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Spain.
On that note, I want to thank the flight attendants, pilots, border agents, and airport staff who’ve all played a crucial role in bringing Canadians home.
They’ve been on the frontlines of this crisis for weeks, but they continue to show up to work and bring families together.
Just this past week, nearly one million Canadians travelled home to Canada.
This would not have been possible without the people who work at our airports, at the border, and at our ports.
So, on behalf of all Canadians, thank you.
We see how hard you’re working and we deeply appreciate it.
Every day, someone asks me how long these restrictions will be in place and the truth is, we don’t know yet.
But here’s what we do know.
The duration of this crisis will be determined by the choices we make right now. By decisions we take every single day.
So, if you want things to get back to normal, do your part.
Stay home.
And if you’ve just returned from abroad, go straight home from the airport and do not leave for at least 14 days.
This is not a suggestion. You cannot pick up groceries or visit your parents or your friends.
You need to go home and stay there.
If people do not follow these guidelines, we will put much more stringent measures in place.
Since the beginning, I have been in constant communication with the First Ministers.
We had another call last night, and we agreed that we have to keep collaborating to ensure that all regions have what they need, including testing equipment and medical supplies.
We discussed the range of challenges being faced, and overcome, across the country.
We talked about working even more closely together to do more to keep Canadians safe.
We also talked about the emergency measures that have been put in place at the provincial and territorial level.
If people do not comply with expert advice and government guidelines, we will have to take additional steps.
Right now, there are people who are still going to work because they have to.
Pharmacists, delivery folks, postal workers, custodial staff, truck drivers, and many, many more are keeping the country running.
They deserve our thanks for everything they do.
But these people are more than just their job. They are somebody’s mom or granddad. Somebody’s best friend or favourite colleague, so please, for them, stay home.
And do it for the health care workers who we can’t afford to lose during the biggest public health crisis our country has ever seen.
Because here’s the hard truth: if our nurses and doctors have COVID-19, they can’t help you.
They won’t be able to treat you or your loved ones if you get sick.
This is serious.
The decisions you make have serious consequences, not just on your community, but on the entire country.
So do your part.
That’s how we will keep each other safe.
Thank you very much, everyone.
",Prime Minister’s remarks updating Canadians on measures to respond to COVID-19,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2020/03/24/prime-ministers-remarks-updating-canadians-measures-respond-covid-19
Chester Arthur,United States of America,1882-04-18 00:00:00,"To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I send herewith a copy of the circular invitation extended to all the independent countries of North and South America to participate in a general congress to be held in the city of Washington on the 22d of November next for the purpose of considering and discussing the methods of preventing war between the nations of America.
In giving this invitation I was not unaware that there existed differences between several of the Republics of South America which would militate against the happy results which might otherwise be expected from such an assemblage. The differences indicated are such as exist between Chile and Peru, between Mexico and Guatemala, and between the States of Central America.
It was hoped that these differences would disappear before the time fixed for the meeting of the congress. This hope has not been realized.
Having observed that the authority of the President to convene such a congress has been questioned, I beg leave to state that the Constitution confers upon the President the power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, and that this provision confers the power to take all requisite measures to initiate them, and to this end the President may freely confer with one or several commissioners or delegates from other nations. The congress contemplated by the invitation could only effect any valuable results by its conclusions eventually taking the form of a treaty of peace between the States represented; and, besides, the invitation to the States of North and South America is merely a preliminary act, of which constitutionality or the want of it can hardly be affirmed.
It has been suggested that while the international congress would have no power to affect the rights of nationalities there represented, still Congress might be unwilling to subject the existing treaty rights of the United States on the Isthmus and elsewhere on the continent to be clouded and rendered uncertain by the expression of the opinions of a congress composed largely of interested parties.
I am glad to have it in my power to refer to the Congress of the United States, as I now do, the propriety of convening the suggested international congress, that I may thus be informed of its views, which it will be my pleasure to carry out.
Inquiry having been made by some of the Republics invited whether it is intended that this international congress shall convene, it is important that Congress should at as early a day as is convenient inform me by resolution or otherwise of its opinion in the premises. My action will be in harmony with such expression.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
SIR:* The attitude of the United States with respect to the question of general peace on the American continent is well known through its persistent efforts for years past to avert the evils of warfare, or, these efforts failing, to bring positive conflicts to an end through pacific counsels or the advocacy of impartial arbitration. This attitude has been consistently maintained, and always with such fairness as to leave no room for imputing to our Government any motive except the humane and disinterested one of saving the kindred States of the American continent from the burdens of war. The position of the United States as the leading power of the New World might well give to its Government a claim to authoritative utterance for the purpose of quieting discord among its neighbors, with all of whom the most friendly relations exist. Nevertheless, the good offices of this Government are not and have not at any time been tendered with a show of dictation or compulsion, but only as exhibiting the solicitous good will of a common friend.
For some years past a growing disposition has been manifested by certain States of Central and South America to refer disputes affecting grave questions of international relationship and boundaries to arbitration rather than to the sword. It has been on several such occasions a source of profound satisfaction to the Government of the United States to see that this country is in a large measure looked to by all the American powers as their friend and mediator.
The just and impartial counsel of the President in such cases has never been withheld, and his efforts have been rewarded by the prevention of sanguinary strife or angry contentions between peoples whom we regard as brethren.
The existence of this growing tendency convinces the President that the time is ripe for a proposal .that shall enlist the good will and active cooperation of all the States of the Western Hemisphere, both north and south, in the interest of humanity and for the common weal of nations.
He conceives that none of the Governments of America can be less alive than our own to the dangers and horrors of a state of war, and especially of war between kinsmen. He is sure that none of the chiefs of Governments on the continent can be less sensitive than he is to the sacred duty of making every endeavor to do away with the chances of fratricidal strife. And he looks with hopeful confidence to such active assistance from them as will serve to show the broadness of our common humanity and the strength of the ties which bind us all together as a great and harmonious system of American Commonwealths.
Impressed by these views, the President extends to all the independent countries of North and South America an earnest invitation to participate in a general congress to be held in the city of Washington on the 24th day of November, 1882, for the purpose of considering and discussing the methods of preventing war between the nations of America. He desires that the attention of the congress shall be strictly confined to this one great object; that its sole aim shall be to seek a way of permanently averting the horrors of cruel and bloody combat between countries, oftenest of one blood and speech, or the even worse calamity of internal commotion and civil strife; that it shall regard the burdensome and far-reaching consequences of such struggles, the legacies of exhausted finances, of oppressive debt, of onerous taxation, of ruined cities, of paralyzed industries, of devastated fields, of ruthless conscription, of the slaughter of men, of the grief of the widow and the orphan, of imbittered resentments that long survive those who provoked them and heavily afflict the innocent generations that come after.
The President is especially desirous to have it understood that in putting forth this invitation the United States does not assume the position of counseling, or attempting through the voice of the congress to counsel, any determinate solution of existing questions which may now divide any of the countries of America. Such questions can not properly come before the congress. Its mission is higher. It is to provide for the interests of all in the future, not to settle the individual differences of the present. For this reason especially the President has indicated a day for the assembling of the congress so far in the future as to leave good ground for hope that by the time named the present situation on the South Pacific coast will be happily terminated, and that those engaged in the contest may take peaceable part in the discussion and solution of the general question affecting in an equal degree the well-being of all.
It seems also desirable to disclaim in advance any purpose on the part of the United States to prejudge the issues to be presented to the congress. It is far from the intent of this Government to appear before the congress as in any sense the protector of its neighbors or the predestined and necessary arbitrator of their disputes. The United States will enter into the deliberations of the congress on the same footing as the other powers represented, and with the loyal determination to approach any proposed solution not merely in its own interest or with a view to asserting its own power, but as a single member among many coordinate and coequal States. So far as the influence of this Government may be potential, it will be exerted in the direction of conciliating whatever conflicting interests of blood or government or historical tradition may necessarily come together in response to a call embracing such vast and diverse elements.
You will present these views to the minister of foreign relations of Mexico, enlarging, if need be, in such terms as will readily occur to you, upon the great mission which it is within the power of the proposed congress to accomplish in the interest of humanity, and upon the firm purpose of the United States to maintain a position of the most absolute and impartial friendship toward all. You will thereupon, in the name of the President of the United States, tender to His Excellency the President of the Mexican Republic a formal invitation to send two commissioners to the congress, provided with such powers and instructions on behalf of their Government as will enable them to consider the questions brought before that body within the limit of submission contemplated by this invitation.
The United States as well as the other powers will in like manner be represented by two commissioners, so that equality and impartiality will be amply secured in the proceedings of the congress.
In delivering this invitation through the minister of foreign affairs you will read this dispatch to him and leave with him a copy, intimating that an answer is desired by this Government as promptly as the just consideration of so important a proposition will permit.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
JAMES G. BLAINE.

Ron DeSantis,United States of America,2020-04-08,"… That means an awful lot to a lot of people right now. We’ve also worked with the Department of Elder Affairs and Florida’s worked with the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association for meal delivery services for seniors. So typically they would do about 45,000 meals statewide, just here in Miami Dade they’re doing 50,000 meals, that’s in a daily basis. So we really appreciate what they’re doing to support our seniors. And obviously talking to the mayors here, I know they’ve done a lot to protect the senior populations and we want to keep doing all we can on that. The other major component to what we’ve been doing from the beginning is there was really a need to expand testing. When this started in February and early March, the testing was scarce, so we’ve worked really hard to expand that in the state of Florida. We will have probably by a … It may even be by now, we may have the results in, but certainly by probably the end of the day, we’ll have over 150,000 tests completed in the state of Florida.
That will put us as one of the top states for testing. The state of Florida and the Florida National Guard have set up seven drive through testing sites, many of them in Southeast Florida so that individuals could go through, get tested, and know whether they’re positive or not. And that’s important, and those drive through sites are important. Getting tested at the hospitals has been important too. But the way these labs have worked, sometimes it takes days to be able to get the results. And so if you’re somebody who is a healthcare worker, you kind of need to know right now whether you’re positive. If you’re a senior in a nursing home and you’re in a hospital with symptoms and they test you but they don’t have results, well, are they going to put you back in the nursing home? Are they going to keep you in the hospital?
So understanding who is positive quickly is important. So we were able to work in with the white house, get a number of this new Abbott labs tests delivered in the state of Florida over the last week to many of the hospital systems here. This is a rapid test where you would go and you get a positive result in five minutes. And so that is huge if you’re talking about protecting the healthcare workforce, if you’re talking about conserving hospital space, talking about protecting seniors. So right now the hospitals that haven’t had them, we’ve worked with the hospitals that do and asked if they would shift resources. So I know Cleveland Clinic has shifted some of these machines to Jackson in Miami. I spoke with Mayor Gelber about the hospital here. We’re going to work with getting them access to this rapid test because I think it just improves outcomes and improves our ability to handle this so well.
The Florida Department of Health also has had a number of these machines delivered and so those are going to be deployed strategically in areas where you have a lot of cases, but I’ve also ordered them to create mobile strike teams to be able to take this and do spot checks at nursing homes and assisted living facilities to see if this is spreading in those facilities to see if staff has them. You don’t even need to test everyone. If you get representative samples, then you could see if it’s there, then you really go and do more. So I think that this is something that will be game changing for us going forward and it’s been a very, very top priority for us. The third priority is one of the reasons why we’re here today. We want to protect our healthcare workers who are on the front line and we want to make sure that the healthcare system can absorb what this virus is pretending for our communities.
I’m pleased with Jared Moscowitz’s leadership, who’s here heading our department of emergency management. You know, this has been the biggest logistics operation in the history of the state. The state has distributed over three million masks, both N95 and surgical masks, almost 225,000 face shields, 4.2 million gloves and 185,000 gowns. And we have more on the way and we’re fighting to get more particularly of the N95 masks. So I want to thank Jared for all he’s done to be able to get the key supplies. And we’ve spoken with the mayors here, I think what they’re doing in terms of the beach or if you’re in the grocery store wearing some type of face covering, I think that’s really smart. The grocery stores are packed and when you have close contact, that’s when this virus is most likely to be transmitted.
So having the mask I think could absolutely cut down on the transmissibility of this. And I think that’s a very important precaution. So we’re going to work to be able to, to give them some more mask. And I think that that’s very, very appropriate. So here at the convention center, we’ve been working with the Army Corps of Engineers over the last several weeks. As many of you know, when this launched with the 15 days to stop the spread and other initiatives that were done in South Florida and statewide, people would talk about flattening the curve so that the hospital system could cope with the patients who were impacted by this illness. And so from the very beginning, we looked strategically around the state and made plans to be able to expand hospital capacity. And so that’s one of the things that we’re going to be doing here today.
This facility, in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers, will open with 400 beds and 50 ICU beds for a total of 450 beds. The hospital will cover 500,000 square feet. We’ll be able to scale up to 1,000 beds if the need is there. In addition to contract staff of doctors, nurses, certified nursing assistants, respiratory therapists, and other medical personnel, the facility will be staffed by 184 members of Florida’s National Guard medical team as follows. 10 physicians, 19 physician assistants, five case managers, five social workers, 25 medical clerks, 25 housekeepers, a patient transporter, 25 EMT technicians, two medical assistants, 50 paramedics, 16 registered nurses, and one licensed infection preventionist. So this will provide a lot of resources should the need arise to be able to care for patients. And this is going to be a facility that will accept the COVID patients.
Some of the overflow that’s been done in other parts of the country, initially they wanted it for non-COVID. This is for COVID. So if somebody has it, this facility is going to be able to accommodate that. And I think that that’s something very important. So this partnership with the corps we think is very important. We thank them for their efforts. Of course we work with them on things like Lake Okeechobee anyways, but I want to thank them and General Seminate for his leadership and for them really stepping up to the plate. This, though, is only one part of the plan to have additional capacity in addition to the beds here in the convention center, we’re setting up 200 beds at the old Pan American Hospital and 250 beds at a field hospital right here in Miami, and those will be beds that are manned with medical professionals that the state of Florida has contracted with. So you’re not going to have to deplete resources from the hospital systems here in Miami Dade County. This is supplementing what’s already there, but it’s not taking from what’s already there.
Outside of Miami, we have an additional four field hospitals as the need may be. We have one that’s ready in Broward, another one that can be stood up very quickly in Palm Beach. And then we’re also looking where on the West coast of Florida and potentially Northeast Florida. But we have ready to be deployed, 4,300 hospital beds and almost 100 … Actually more than 150 ICU beds, a 451 nurses, 15 nurse practitioners, and 14 doctors. They’re under contract, they’re standing by, and they’re ready to deploy. So that is why I would much rather be prepared for the worst and the worst, not come here than not be prepared. And so what you’re seeing here today is the state of Florida, the Army Corps of Engineers, Miami Dade County, Miami Beach, doing all we can to be fully prepared.
Again, these plans have been laid for quite some time. Finally, just an overview of what we’re looking at in terms of hospital capacity in Florida. Right now, the availability statewide is 43%. Miami Dade is 43%, Broward is almost 46%, Palm beach 49%, Hillsborough 41%, Orange 44%, and Duvall 47%. so we have capacity at the hospitals. We don’t know what a surge may bring, but we have to prepare for that so that we’re able to take care of people. So I think that this is the smart thing to do. I think it’s the responsible thing to do. And I’m really glad to have the army Corps of engineers with us and so I’d like to be able to introduce Lieutenant General Todd Seminate. I want to thank you for your friendship and your support and for your leadership.
Great. Anyone have questions for anyone?
So social distancing is important. Some people don’t have access online. Obviously the website was having problems. We’ve put a lot of servers in. Sunday I think they did 62,000, then it started to go a little slower yesterday. So they’re working on that and they’re going to continue to do it. But for people that don’t have access to the internet or just are having a tough time, we want there to be options. Now, I told the folks in Hialeah, if they’re going to come, hand it out when they’re coming in the car, do a drive through. Just do it in a way that’s not going to create crowds. I mean, right now, we have a respiratory virus that is transmitted when you have close, usually close, sustained contact with somebody. And if you refrain from that, and my orders for state, and I know the mayor here has had this for a while, I mean, is to minimize contacts outside the household. And so that’s what you got to be trying to do. So I know that they’re going to try to do something where they hand them out to people …
… I know that they’re going to try to do some with, where they hand them out to people coming in their cars, and then we have a deal with FedEx. FedEx is going to print them, people can grab them, FedEx will mail them back later that day. We want that to be an option. I have 2,000 state employees identified, who aren’t a part of unemployment, who are in these other agencies that were surging in, so as these applications come in, they got to process them. We’re putting forth an effort for this that we’ve never really done on a thing like this in the state of Florida before. But I think it’s important because of the shock that so many people felt.
Things were going along great. I remember when this, when all this really started really getting heavy in March, the unemployment was 2.8%. I remember looking at the report, thinking, “Man, those were the days,” and that was going to change. You have so many people that had jobs, through no fault of their own, now they’re furloughed. Some have already been fired. There’s other places where maybe they pay you for a little bit, but some of them aren’t going to keep doing that. I think it’s really, really important for folks to be able to have access to that.
But don’t violate the social distancing. If you stick to the plan here, you’re going to be able to come back to work much quicker on the back end.
I mean, the law is when you can file, but what I’ve told Ken Lawson is, if someone was trying to apply on, what, last Wednesday and the system wasn’t really working, then I think you should count that as the day. He’s looking at how that will work. But I mean I think that that’s a reasonable accommodation if the system, because when this all happened, I told the DEO, I said, “Look, you know there’s going to be a surge, hire more people in the call center, do all that.” They were like, “Yeah, we’ll do it. But just tell people it’s easier for them to go to the website.” They were telling people to go to this thing and then it reached capacity, and so that is something that I don’t think is their fault.
The field hospital is, the one in Miami’s up. That’s up. Yeah, and then this one, well, we told them by April 20th. Normally that’s a pretty tough schedule, but I think they’re going to do it and then they’ll probably exceed it.
Look, these things are all being revised about when this or when that, I mean, so what we basically said is, look, “We’re going to plan for kind of the worst case. Do that.” But I mean if you look at how the cases have been going and the new hospitalizations, clearly there’s capacity right now to handle what’s happening. Absent a major change, capacity’s there. We don’t know what kind of change will be. We don’t know. That’s why they’re doing it. That’ll be there. That basically, I think, coincides with when people think, well, some of these things think Florida may hit the peak. You hear different things, but I just think we need to be ready and that’s what this will do.
Well, so our unemployment benefits, as you know, is set by law. What I told our folks is we need to get that out. I want the people that are applying to get their benefits as soon as possible because these federal benefits, they’re not going to be here tomorrow. I mean, that’s just the way it is.
I think that the Feds are working hard to be able to get this money. I know I’ve been working with Senator Rubio on these small business loans. They’ve actually gotten that out and even though there’s been some complications to it for government work, I mean, it’s amazing that they’ve been able to get that many out. I’ve said, “Get the money out at the state level,” and then we really want to help and prod the Feds to get their share. The Fed share, obviously, is going to be more significant than what we currently have in Florida law; but whatever we have in Florida law, we obviously want to be able to give to folks.
I’ll take it too, but let me just make a point because we were talking with both the mayors and I’ve been talking with other folks throughout the state and actually people in the White House about, okay, obviously, we’ve got to get through this, but we’d be foolish not to plan and say, “What does it look like once we think that the cases are declining in terms of how we interact and how the economy works?” It seems to me that, standing here today, we have a huge, huge array of options compared to where we were just three or four weeks ago in terms of, for example, you go back four weeks, I mean, it was hard to find even a swab to test somebody for this. Now we have this five-minute test that’s available.
You look at how Florida, I mean, we’ve had some of the areas that have been more hotspots, I think have been connected to cruise ships. Obviously, we have people coming from all over the world all the time. I would like to see these rapid tests integrated with some of the international travel. If you’re coming from like a Brazil or coming from these other places, it’d be good to have that, those tests available and done so that as people come to Florida, we know that people aren’t necessarily carrying the virus.
I mean, we’re going through a lot here. Miami’s gone through a lot here. Other parts of Florida have gone through a lot here. We’ve had a lot of deaths, dislocation economically, we’re trying to mitigate that and we’re going to try to bounce back from it. But you know, to go through all that and then just have people coming internationally or even domestically and seeding it all over again I think is a problem. I think we need to be thinking, I’m going to talk to the president about this, the fact of the matter is airplanes are what brought the virus to the United States. We’ve got to think smart about this, but I think we want to have people be able to function as a society. But I think there’s ways that we can now do that much smarter. But the travel I think is something that we’re really going to have to build in some protections for.
We do. I mean, so first of all, if you look at the report that the State Department of Health puts out, I challenge you to find another state that’s even close with transparency. We have a dash-, excuse me, we have a dashboard that’s up. You see in real time as the case has come in. When our numbers come in, those are fresh. Some of these other States, those are 48-hours old and so we’re doing it fresh. We now have it broken out that you have it broken out by age, you have the number of cases, positive cases, listed in any nursing home or assisted-living facility by county. Because people had questions in terms of race and ethnicity, so we’re now breaking out by race or ethnicity. Don’t have it for every patient, but the ones we do, we’re putting it there.
Then we’re also, with University of Florida and Shands, we’re supporting with our supplies kind of an investigation into some of the public-housing communities. It’s going to be in Jacksonville, primarily African American, to figure out underserved populations, where they may be not getting what they need. Now we have drive-through testing centers. It’s open for everyone, but maybe the message hasn’t, so we’re looking at that. We’re doing some other random testing to try to figure out how many people are asymptomatic that may have it. We’re doing a lot. All that and every daily report, the number of people, either staff or somebody who lives in assisted-living is listed by county, the numbers.
Now it’s also important to keep in mind, a nursing home is going to be a different environment than some of the independent living. Some of the independent living is, yeah, it’s like living in an apartment. People can come and go. We have tried to do restrictions there, but actually, people are going to be able to make, the nursing home you have an ability to control access and as I mentioned with the Abbott Labs test, I’ve told the department of health, I want you to harness that ability to test quickly and do these checks in some of those facilities. They’re working on that, but I told them to deploy that as soon as possible.
",Gov. Ron DeSantis Florida COVID-19 Briefing Transcript April 8,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/gov-ron-desantis-florida-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8
Joe Biden,United States of America,2020-09-23,"Hello, hello, hello, hello. My name is Joe Biden. I’m trying to get a job with Chris. He is Mr. President. He’s president of the union. Mr. President, I was kidding him. You know, the hardest thing, only thing harder than being president of a union is being the mayor of a beautiful city.
Folks, thanks for taking the time to be here today. I really appreciate it. And we even have an astronaut in our house and I tell you what, that’s pretty cool. Look, first of all, I want to thank Chris and the mayor for being here, and all of you for being here. You know, these are tough times. Over 200,000 Americans have passed away. Over 200,000, and the number is still rising. The impact on communities is bad across the board, but particularly bad for African-American communities. Almost four times as likely, three times as likely to catch the disease, COVID, and when it’s caught, twice as likely to die as white Americans. It’s sort of emblematic of the inequality that exists and the circumstances that exist.
One of the things that really matters to me, is we could do … It didn’t have to be this bad. You have 30 million people on unemployment, you have 20 million people figuring whether or not they can pay their mortgage payment this month, and what they’re going to be able to do or not do as the consequence of that, and you’ve got millions of people who are worried that they’re going to be thrown out in the street because they can’t pay their rent. Although they’ve been given a reprieve for three months, but they have to pay double the next three months when it comes around.
How people going to do that? And the way, in fact, the Democratic House and the Senate passed, stepped up and passed a significant amount of money to help people get through the process, including keeping businesses open and the like. Well, guess what? They insisted there being a thing called an inspector general, somebody watching where every dollar went. The first thing the president of the United States did is fire that inspector general. There is no inspector. He’s fired. Fired. And so you got 40% of, only 40% of the money intended for small businesses going to small businesses. Only 40% of it. 60% has gone to the Mar-a-Lago crowd.
In addition to that, we find ourselves in a circumstance where the idea that we’re going to continue to provide for unemployment insurance for people is very much in doubt, although the House just passed a package today. My generic point is, that the University of Columbia pointed out, that if in fact the president had acted, even though we know now he knew exactly how bad the pandemic was back in February, he’s on tape with Bob Woodward saying he knew how bad it was, and he didn’t say a thing. He didn’t say a thing.
If he had spoken, as I said, they said at Columbia, one week earlier, 37,000 more people be alive today. We’re going to have another influx of cases, just between now and January, it’s expected that we’re going to have somewhere between, depending on which estimate you take, between 138 and 178,000 more deaths. And if people just do what we’re doing here, and when you’re at a social distance, as I am, you can take a mask off, but wear a mask. They estimate that would save about close to 89, 90,000 people. And so it’s about being responsible. It’s about being responsible. And we’re not being very responsible.
But what I want to talk to you about today is that we have to break a cycle. The cycle that exist is that the African-American community by and large finds itself at the bottom of the economic heap, businesses and others, when things are good. When things get bad, they’re the first ones in the hole. And when things get better, they’re the last ones out. In addition to that, we have a criminal justice system that needs significant repair. And we’re just only beginning, slightly, to make some progress now.
And thirdly, if you’re a business person, let me put it this way. Every person out there wants an opportunity to make it for their family. My dad used to have an expression, “Everybody’s entitled to be treated with dignity.” And then he said, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything’s going to be okay.'”
For too many people, particularly in the African-American community, they can’t say that. That’s not able to be done. So one of the things that I want to talk with you about today, is how do we build wealth? Because ultimately, ultimately the African-American community only is going to have its place equal to everyone else when they’re in a position to be able to build wealth, be able to build wealth. And that goes for everything from access to being able to purchase a home, access to jobs, access to just being able to have an even shot. And that’s what I hope we’re going to talk a little about today.
It goes to education, as well as access to education, access beyond. Everything from a lot of poor whites and African-Americans, poor African-Americans and Hispanic live in Title I districts, meaning that they live in school districts that have very low tax base. And right now we spent $15 billion a year to compensate for that low tax base. I increased that to $45 billion. What it does, it keeps teachers in schools because we’re short teachers significantly. 125,000 teachers short right now. Be over half a million by 2023. In addition to that, we find ourselves in a circumstance where we used to have in our schools, in the old days, used to have one … Right now we don’t have any, we virtually have no school psychologists in our schools. And so teachers come in to school and they’re expected to solve every problem. Well, there’s one school psychologist for every 1,507 kids in school. It should be closer to one to 500. We can do that by increasing the money I just talked about from 15 to 45. And send every single child that’s three years old, four years old, and five years old, not to daycare, but to school. All the studies of the great universities in this state and every other have pointed out in the last eight years, that’ll increase by 58% their chances of going all the way through school, no matter what the ZIP code they come from, no matter where they are, and be able to do it without getting themselves in trouble.
And then we’re going to talk about, I think a big issue here is access to apprenticeships and access to community colleges and college, and the student debt requirements that are there. Hope we can talk about that. But I want to talk about basically one-
Hope we can talk about that, but I want to talk about basically one big important thing. How do we change the dynamic? This is a gigantic opportunity. As bad as things have gotten, the blinders have sort of been taken off the American people now. They look out there, and we have the pandemic, unemployment. We have race relations that are just been drawn into focus and everything from police brutality to lack of access. But the American people have all of a sudden, average people have gone, “My Lord. Holy mackerel. I didn’t know it was this bad.” A lot of them didn’t know. A lot did. But a lot didn’t know it was this bad. And talking to … Well, I won’t go into it. I’m talking too much now in my opening statement, but here’s the point.
The point is, I believe we have a gigantic opportunity, a gigantic opportunity to fundamentally change the systemic racism and the systemic problems that exist in our system. And I think we have to do it, but only one way to do it. We’ve got to show up and vote. But I believe the American people are not going to be turned off. I believe no matter what the administration does to try to make it hard to vote for everyone, not just people of color, but everyone, no matter what, I think they’re going to vote. You see what’s happened in Virginia, early voting. They have four hour lines in the first day, and we’re over 40 days out. People are going to show up and vote. They will not be dissuaded.
And so that’s why I’m optimistic. I was asked by one of the foreign leaders when I was overseas, when I was the vice president, they said, “Can you define America for me?” I said, “Yes, I can, in one word. Possibilities. Possibilities.” We’re the only country that believes anything’s possible. But it’s about time we make it possible for everybody? That’s what this is all about. I think we got a gigantic opportunity in the year 2020 to make these changes. And with that, as my mother would say, I’m going to hush up and take any questions you all have. And I’ve got to get out of the way here.
I was kidding Chris inside. I was saying as long as I can say what the best HBCU is in America, Delaware State University. But that’s another issue. That’s a joke, but it’s not a joke. They’re great. That’s how I got my start, by the way. I went to University of Delaware. But the reason I got involved in politics in the first place is because of what was going on in my state in terms of segregation and in terms of Dr. King being assassinated. Part of the, major part of our city was burned to the ground. That’s how I got engaged. And a lot of my support came out of that HBCU.
Look, right now, one thing all the data shows is that, given an opportunity, an equal opportunity, there’s not a single thing that an African-American can’t do that a white American can do, that a Hispanic American, an Asian American … I mean, not a single thing. And so what’s happened? It’s about access to opportunity and access to good jobs. Now, an awful lot of universities like, great university like UNC or Wake Forest, a lot of schools, they have endowments, and the endowment allows them to provide for the circumstance to bid for these major federal initiatives that allow them to bring into the school a technology or a program that is able to bring in outside sponsors, as well as government sponsors, and then have students work in those areas.
For example, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a big deal, but you have to … And as a future, there’s going to be millions of, over time, good paying jobs in the area of cybersecurity. But because the HBCUs, for example, most of them don’t have the economic … They don’t have the endowment to be able to build the facilities that can attract the environment, the government funding, as well as private endowment. They don’t get to set these up.
For example, when I was vice president, we went down to Roanoke and we provided funding for an HBCU to have a cybersecurity proposal. They did it. They got the contract. And now what they’re doing are training young women and men who’ll get out and good starting jobs, jobs where you can end up being paid more than a hundred grand a year. And they’re fully, totally, thoroughly capable.
What I’ve done is I’ve proposed, and we’ll get this done … I proposed a 10-year program for $70 billion for HBCUs, $70 billion. And that $70 billion will be available through the HBCUs based on their competition to get access to it, but everyone will qualify, every HBCU. And they’ll be able to do the kinds of things that other universities do.
For example, Delaware State University is a great university. The president of the university is a young man who used to work for me in my Senate office. Now, brilliant guy. He’s a doctorate. The end result of it is though when the University of Delaware makes an application for dealing with solar energy, because it has a significant base, it gets this significant injection of technological capability, or, for example, light metals. They took over an old facility, it used to be a Ford facility long, long time ago. They took over a facility used to be a Chrysler facility and got shut down. And now what do they have at that facility? They have people in that facility who are now doing metallurgy that relate to making lightweight aluminum and metal decks for aircraft carriers. Well, it’s a multi-million dollar and will end up being a billion-dollar project. And so the people who get to work on that, the very students in that university get to work on it, they’re the ones that are going to go out and get these great jobs. So that’s the first thing I’m going to do for HBCUs.
Secondly, we have to look at, and we have been looking at, the idea that we have to bring in HBCUs to engage in more of what we are doing in terms of our national dialogue. And for example, I kid … Two of the guys that are on my co-sponsors of my campaign, African-Americans, they’ve talked about themselves as Morgan men. I’m a Morgan man. Well, there’s a lot of great universities including right here, but we have an opportunity to provide for, you’re able to get to those universities. How can you do it? Well, I’m going to see to it that any family, anyone who comes from a family that makes a total income of less than $125,000 a year gets free college education. They don’t get in. If they get in and qualify, they pay nothing to go to college.
Secondly, there are also programs that exist now that if you provide for the work, that you will volunteer to do something in the public interest, and you do it for five years or more, you can deduct $10, 000 a year up to $50,000 off of that debt you have. And you have an awful lot of young African-Americans that have graduated. The average debt is about $19,000 a year. Well, it’s hard as hell to get started. Hard to get started when you have that debt hanging over your head. The average debt is even higher. It’s up to $28,000 a year, someone graduating from a four year school.
And that’s why the economists had predicted prior to, and I’ll end with this, I’m telling you too much, but because I’m pretty passionate about this. What happens is that if, it was pointed out before the COVID crisis, that we’re going to have an economic slowdown because the entire generation, this from 9/11 generation through to the generation now, and coming out of this, this god-awful circumstance we’re in, they, in fact, are not going to have the wherewithal because of student debt to be able to borrow the money to buy a home, buy a new vehicle, buy an apartment, and spend the money and capital, where a significant portion of our economy is driven by consumption, by consumption.
And this generation, this whole new generation from 9/11 on, that in fact is, they’re not in a position to be able to do it. So there’s a whole lot of reasons that economically this will benefit. This isn’t just draining money. And by the way, I pay for every one of these things by the way, I deal with the tax structure. But that’s another story. So that’s a piece of what I think we can and should be doing with HBCUs. And secondly, I will, in my administration, elevate, elevate the standing of HBCUs by the people in my administration as well.
There’s a microphone right there.
We’re going to raise it to $15 an hour nationally. I’ve been deeply involved in raising it as I’ve gone around the country working with cities and counties that in fact have raised it, including New York City and out on the West Coast, as well. Here’s the deal. If you make less than $15 an hour working 40 hours a week, you’re making a wage under the poverty level. No one in America should be working for a 40-hour week job and still be living in poverty. It should not exist. Number one.
Number two, it also demonstrates that if we pay people $15 an hour as a minimum wage, you grow the economy. The idea that this somehow puts people out of business, there’s no evidence of that. What happens is you have people, if you’re making 15 bucks an hour instead of $7 an hour, you’re able to buy more things. You’re able to pay more bills. You’re able to do more that ends up increasing the GDP, the growth of the whole economy. So it’s not only a good thing for the person who is going to be making a decent wage from the beginning, but going to be good for the economy as a whole.
My mother would say, “God love you, dear.”
Well, as a simple proposition for me, I don’t exaggerate as a second grade teacher, why you’re so important. If I had only $1 to spend in education and I could spend it post-graduation or pre-kindergarten, I’d spend it pre-kindergarten. Not a joke. Because you know as well as I do based on your educational background, that 60% of a child’s brain is already developed by the time they’re three, four, five years old.
And so what happens is, people start off based on their ZIP code and their family background. They may start off way behind the curve. You know you have a lot of students who they come into school, if they come from a very poor background in a community raised by a single mom or a single dad, through no fault of their own, they will have probably heard 1 million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade. That by itself is an impediment. Nobody’s forced that on anybody, but we’ve got to change it. And so the way to change it is threefold.
Number one, as I said, provide for early education, starting at three years of age, and it’s not … This is you think, “Oh my Lord, why we have a three-year-old go to school?” They learn as rapidly as a six-year-old, a 12-year-old, a 14-year-old. And they just suck it all up. They just suck it all up. Number one. Number two, to make sure that we pay teachers enough money to stay in the business of teaching. My wife’s a full-time teacher. My wife has never stopped. As first lady, as the second lady, I should say, she taught 15 credits every semester at a community college. Before that, she taught juniors and-
At a community college. Before that, she taught juniors and seniors in high school for 25 years. I think it was 25. My point is a long time. Although, I’m not allowed to tell the exact number because my wife is 30 years younger than I am. I started off not quite that much. There’s no woman in the entire Biden family as old as any man, but that’s another issue. All kidding aside, the fact is that it is the lifeblood of… Look, people… They say, “Well, these two children.” They’re all our children. They are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft.
It’s bizarre, crazy for us. In every single empirical study done, the more money you spend, the better you educate a child throughout the process, the better the community as a whole is.
Everybody, across the board. That’s why we also have to make sure that we provide for more direct funding for specific programs in schools. As you know, better than most will know, the bulk of all the funding, if your school uses local funding-
Local funding.
It’s not national funding. It’s not federal funding. Federal funding can focus on particular needs within schools. One of those needs is to deal with access to equal education in the early grades and not be determined by your zip code. That requires us to spend more money on schools that in fact, and teachers… Look, I’m not going to ask you what you make. Teachers… One of the other things that all the studies have shown is that when you’re in a student body where there’s students of color, it makes a gigantic difference if there are teachers of color, particularly male teachers of color.
A gigantic difference. It’s just a factual predicate. We have to encourage schools of education to attract more people of color to get in and teach. The only way to do that is to raise the salaries.
Raise the salaries.
I mean, idea that a teacher is out there after several years making $40,000… You have, probably, a student debt larger than that. Enough, for real. That’s why the last piece of the student debt… Anybody who has a student debt who teaches, that counts as working for the national interest. You get to deduct $ 10,000 of that student debt per year for five years, and up to $50,000 if you’re teaching.
We can afford this, by the way. This is not something that we have… Just give you a little idea here. I carry this card with me because everybody says, “Well, Biden’s going to raise all taxes, and everybody’s going to be in trouble, and what we’re going to do here.” Let’s see if I can find it, if I have it here. Anyway, I have a list of how I will fund every single thing that I’m talking about. For example, if we just made corporations not pay 21%, and 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay no tax, zero, zero, okay, none… If we just made them pay 28, it used to be 38, make 28%, raise it to 28%, and everybody had to pay it, that would raise a total of $ 1,370 billion. I’m not trying to punish anybody. It’s time for everybody to start paying their fair share.
President has a new proposal. Some of you may like it. I don’t know anybody in my neighborhood know it works very well, and that is another $30 billion tax cut for billionaires. You think I’m making it like billionaire. I sound like Bernie Sanders, “Billionaires are bad.” That’s not the problem. Problem is in reducing the capital gains tax… If you make your money off investments as opposed to sweating your brow or walking up and getting a paycheck, right, he thinks you should only have to pay 15% of your income. You’ll pay more as a school teacher than somebody making $20 million bucks. It’s all coming from investments. It’s not right. Don’t want to punish anybody. Just about time everybody pays their fair share. The way I do that is I raise the tax back for millionaires and billionaires to 39.4%. They’re talking about 90%. That’s not true. It was 39.4% when Bush was president. You just raise that tax rate back up to 39.4%. That raises 6%. That raises $90 billion. Just give you an example.
There’s much more I could talk, but my point is it will not… By the way, I went to undergraduate and graduate school. I was very flattered that, I think it’s 14 Nobel Laureates in economics, just endorsed me, and said my plans make sense. All this stuff about Biden’s going to bankrupt the country and Biden is going to spend $400 billion, and you’re going to raise your taxes… not true. We can do it all by just somebody just starting to pay your fair share. That’s all. That’s all. Give people who need a break, a break.
Thank you.
Maybe three. I know I’m in trouble.
I know I’m late, but I apologize.
Yes. There was a big plan to do it. There’s a modal plan. First of all, the Cares Act, which passed out of the House and Senate, which was a total of $2 trillion overall, twice, was supposed to provide what they called the Main Street Lending Program. For four months, it didn’t lend a penny. None of the money went out, number one, because you got 20 Republicans in the Senate who said they don’t want to depend anything on anything, for real. The president who has, as I said, fired the Inspector General, so you don’t know where the money’s going for certain. Secondly, on the early program for small businesses… The small business is defined of fewer than 50 employees. Now, most small businesses that are neighborhood small businesses are 10 or fewer employees.
What I propose is we focus on making sure that the money goes directly to those businesses that in fact provide for being able to keep their employees on the payroll for the 10 or fewer employees. That’s a priority, and then 50 and under. Here’s what’s happened. What’s happened is that not only has that not occurred, a lot of the money has gone to very big businesses that didn’t need the… I mean, they may need it, but they didn’t need it to stay alive. Even when they got it, what did they do?
The commitment that I proposed, and we thought we had done, is that right now, if you get a government bailout, quote, unquote, “loan to stay alive,” what you cannot do is take that money and either buy back your own stock and, or increase your salaries with that money. It’s to keep people employed, keep them on a payroll. That’s what a lot of the businesses have done. They buy back their own stock, increasing the net worth of the people who own the stock, and in fact, pay their salaries based on stock then. They should not be allowed to do that, number one, with government money, bailing people out.
Secondly, a lot of you don’t know the circumstance. Now there’s no national standards as to how to open. How do you open safely? President says, “Just put up a sign, Come on in.” Well, you know your employee. Beyond your employees, your customers are going to go, “I don’t know. I mean, does everybody have to have the mask? Do they have dividers in the restaurant? Tell me how the sanitary conditions are working.” Well, you need money to pay for all that stuff. That’s why we proposed to have a multi-billion dollar program where businesses are able to get the money, not borrow the money, get the money to be able to open in the middle of this pandemic, including fixing the testing fiasco.
You should be in a situation where your employees can, in 24 hours, get a test to determine whether or not they’re positive or negative. You need to do that for your own protection, and the public likes to know that is protection that there are protection against anything that happens within your restaurant. The bottom line is the money is already there. The president is just not releasing it. Department is not releasing the money. It’s all done in order to be able to keep the economy moving.
Right now, we have over 30 million people on unemployment, over 30 million in unemployment. How in God’s name are we going to generate economic growth unless we can figure out how to keep these people back and help you get back in business? It’s the same way with schools. How many schools are not opening because there are no national standards set? No national standards set. For example, there’s a outfit… Am I telling you too much? You want me to stop?
Okay. I’m really good at this. This drives me crazy. Right now, we’re in a situation where if you take a look, there is no national standard for how to open schools, how to open them safely, because the president says, “I have no responsibility. That’s not my response.” I mean, literally, that’s his phrase. “It’s not my responsibility. I’m not the blame for any of this. Let the governors or the mayors take care of it,” and then without the financial help that’s needed to be able to take care of it. I’ve laid out in detail back in July, what we’d have to do to open safely and includes providing the protective PPE, the mask, and other things that are needed, gloves, et cetera, for the schools, the school teachers, and for the children coming to school.
Secondly, you have to reduce the number of students in one room. You have to have modules that are smaller. For that, you need more teachers, not fewer teachers. You got to pay more teachers. Number three, you’ve got to be able to sanitize the schools, whether it’s everything from the water fountain to the lavatory, or just the surfaces that are touched, and what is breathed on by people. That costs a lot of money to do that, like it would for a restaurant as well for you to have to do that.
The money is there, available, to do that, but the president refuses. What he says is just open up and make sure that… School should just open up. It also relates to how far down you’ve got the reinfection rate. If it’s down below one, then it’s rational. You can, with those protections, go ahead and open a school, but watch it very closely. It requires testing and tracing to make sure you’re still on course there.
Look, the other thing is that if you think about it, the FEMA, the Federal Emergency… They had agreed that they were going to provide masks for schools. They started to hand them out to schools. Well, guess what? The president didn’t like that, or somebody didn’t like that. The ruling was made, “Opening schools safely is not a national emergency,” so they stopped it. Refusing to even provide masks for schools because it’s not a national emergency. Well, if this isn’t a national emergency, I don’t know what the hell is. The way we’re doing this is the way… I’ll end with this.
… way and I’ll end with this. The president was in Ohio, I guess a couple of days ago at a rally. I don’t want to misquote him. And he said at the rally and I wrote this down, he said that “We virtually turned the corner. Nobody is really dying.” He said, “Yeah, elderly people are dying and they’re dying because they have heart conditions or other, but quote unquote, “virtually, they’re virtually nobodies. They’re the only ones dying.”
So you go home and your mom is gone, your dad’s gone. He’s a virtual nobody? The idea, the way we’re talking about people, and this is all within our power to do something. The virus wasn’t his fault, but the way he’s handled it has been close to criminal. And so many people breaking their necks and by the way, my deceased wife, when I first got married, I married a beautiful woman from Syracuse, New York, Skaneateles, New York. And I got elected and I was 29-years-old. I come from a very modest family. Not bragging about it, but I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. Because I didn’t think you were supposed to earn any money while you’re there other than your salary.
And then when I got elected vice president, one of the press outlets said, “It’s probable no man has ever been assuming the office of vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden.” I hope they weren’t talking intellectual assets. When I got elected when I was 29, I was in Washington before I was sworn in and I got a phone call from my fire department saying my wife and daughter have just been killed. And my two boys were not likely to make it. A tractor trailer broadsided them while they were Christmas shopping. And at the time, my wife’s father, my father-in-law, he came home from World War II and he had owned a restaurant. He was a cook in World War II in the Navy and he ended up opening up a restaurant in a place called Auburn, New York, a town about 20,000 people, just south of Syracuse.
And it became the meeting place for everybody. It’s a place that doctors would start off the morning getting their coffee and the lawyers would have their lunch and kids after graduations would come to this called the Hunter Dinerant and then he opened up other restaurants. And in order to try to convince me to stay, I don’t blame him. I do the same with my daughter. Try to convince after he graduated to take a job in Upstate New York, rather than go back to Delaware. He offered me his prize diner. And he was making at that time, I would have made five times what I made as a lawyer. A starting lawyer salary is six grand and it was 30,000 bucks a year.
But the problem was for three years, I had five years I watched how hard he worked. I don’t know how you do it. You got to love it. Even in good times they think you’re crazy. It’s 24 hours a day, but you deserve a break and your employees deserve a break. And the fact that you’re fighting so hard to keep them on a job is a testament to the kind of people you are. But I promise you, I guarantee you if I’m elected, you’ll get both the PPE. You’ll get also the money to be able to open and the additional money, not only to maintain your employees, but to maintain an open place that you in fact can.
I’ve met with a lot of restaurateurs up and around the country so they can open up and do everything from having plastic shields in front of the cashiers, to a lot of things you can do to make it safe, make it safe, and you’ll get the help.
Thank you. I can really do yes or no if you ask me the easy questions.
I used to be a city council when I ran for the Senate because it was too hard. They know where you live.
Oh my Lord, I apologize. I didn’t know. I’m sorry.
Well, first of all, and I guess I’ll just say it. This has been the most corrupt administration in modern American history. The Justice Department has turned into the president’s private law firm. He actually has them representing him on women who accused him of rape. Where does that come from? And the Justice Department under my administration will be totally independent of me.
I will not direct them who to prosecute, how to prosecute, what to prosecute. And I will not be injecting. I will not enter their decisions based upon the judgments they make about what cases they bring and they don’t bring. With regard to the Civil Rights Division, I would significantly increase two things. One, civil rights presence in the Justice Department elevated so it has access to and transparency to all police departments’ activities across the country. Just so they are aware that it’s transparent what’s going on.
I would also make sure that I elevate the Justice Department, excuse me, the Civil Rights Division to have a direct office with inside the White House. When, for example, I’m the guy that wrote the Violence Against Women Act. When the president asked me what I wanted as vice president, I said, “I want to have jurisdiction over that act inside the White House.” Because it elevates the standing of whatever that office that comes inside the White House.
So I would make sure there’s a combination of the Civil Rights Division having more direct authority inside the Justice Department and being able to investigate than in fact it has now. But most of all, most of all, I would have an attorney general who understood his oath of office. It’s not a joke. The attorney general has the oath of office that in fact could do and move on what the professionals in the department thought had to be pursued without my interfering to say, “No, they’re my friends” or “I know them” or “Go after this person. Go after Hillary.” You know what I mean? This kind of stuff.
I get asked the question all the time by the press that travels with me, although I’m not sure the same ones that are traveling today have asked it, but I get asked the following question. “If in fact you get elected, would you prosecute Trump? Would you pursue prosecuting Trump?” And the answer is I’m not going to pursue prosecuting anybody. I’m going to do what the Justice Department says should be done, should be done and not politicize it. It’s the most dangerous thing that’s happened so far is the politicization of the Department of Justice. It’s become the Department of Trump and that’s wrong.
Who’s the fellow who runs 26 organizations for housing? Public? I know we didn’t get a chance to talk. Because I think what you’re doing is incredibly consequential. And I like to give you a paper on the way out of what I think we can and should do. It’s very detailed and I’d love your feedback. I’ll put a phone number on it, okay? Because it is a gigantic, gigantic, gigantic undertaking. And unless we can get people into housing, unless we can provide for housing, unless we can stop the gentrification where people are left out, then we’re going to be in real trouble.
And what you’re doing is really … I’m not trying to boost him. I’ve never met the gentleman, but I did read your bio and what you’re working on. And I’d really like your input and may able to call you if I could after you get what I’m proposing in detail and see what we can work out. And part of the reason I do this and what I miss about being able to do larger engagements is this is where I learn. I’m a tactical guy. I mean, I’d rather be shaking your hand and looking you in the eye and you telling me what needs to be done.
And don’t be reluctant at all to criticized my plan if you think it doesn’t make sense. I think it’s pretty good. I’ve worked on it really, really hard. It goes from Section 8 housing all the way to first-time home buyers, to the whole notion of these… Anyway, I’m going to give it to you before I leave, okay? You’re very polite to sit here all this time. Thank you. Thank you everybody. I really appreciate it.
Don’t Jump.

Jonathan Reynolds,United Kingdom,2020-08-10,"This research confirms what many businesses have been saying for months – the removal of government support while some businesses have yet to even open their doors again has created a jobs crisis.
Every job lost is a tragedy. We know that unemployment scars employees, their families and their communities. The Government must act now to put an end to this jobs crisis.
The Government’s one size fits all approach is clearly not working and they must now adopt a tailored approach, getting support to where it is needed to prevent even more redundancies.
",2020 Comments on Unemployment Risk,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/jonathan-reynolds-2020-comments-on-unemployment-risk/
Nick Thomas-Symonds,United Kingdom,2020-06-04,"We have been calling for sensible screening measures at the border for months, and will of course study the detail of what has been announced. It is vital that the UK has a plan for minimising the risk of infections coming into the country, but the Home Secretary must also realise that there are fundamental questions that she needs to answer: why these particular measures, and why now? From 1 January to 23 March, when the lockdown was imposed, only 273 people were formally quarantined from four flights—three from Wuhan and one from Tokyo—when over 18 million people enter the ​country by air. The Home Secretary just said in her statement that this was because domestic transmission was widespread, but the Government’s own chief scientific adviser said that
“a lot of the cases in the UK didn’t come from China and didn’t come from the place you might have expected, they came from European imports and the high level of travel into the UK at that time.”
Ministers saw on their television screens what was happening in Italy and Spain.
On 30 April, I wrote to the Home Secretary to ask her to publish in full the scientific advice that her decisions on measures at the border at that time were based on so that we could learn the lessons going forward. She has not even replied to my letter. Not making all that information public is a mistake. Unfortunately, like too much of the Home Office’s handling of this crisis, the management of arrivals to the United Kingdom has lacked urgency and coherence.
As long ago as 10 May, the Prime Minister gave notice of these quarantining measures. Why have the Government wasted precious weeks talking about possible border restrictions, rather than taking effective actions? If these measures are necessary from 8 June, why have they not been necessary in recent weeks or from when they were first announced by the Home Secretary herself —on 22 May? Can the Home Secretary give me her assurance that the measures that will take effect from Monday next week have been recommended and approved by SAGE? I join her in her praise of what those at Border Force have done, but can she give me further assurance that Border Force staff on the frontline will have all the resources and protection that they need?
The Government’s confusion over arrivals and quarantine has widespread implications for the UK economy, particularly aviation, hospitality and tourism, and related supply chains. Huge numbers of jobs are at risk, yet the crucial package of support for these industries that Labour has argued for has yet to materialise. In her statement, the Home Secretary mentioned a roundtable with the Transport Secretary and businesses tomorrow, but the Government should already have done that. They should be presenting these steps today as part of an all-encompassing approach to travel and the aviation sector, backed up by the published scientific evidence. This is necessary because there has to be reassurance that quarantine has a genuine public health benefit now that, according to the Government, it did not have in past months, and that these measures are not just a three-week fudge to try to spare the Government the embarrassment of failing to grip this issue at the right time.
Given that there is no vaccine at the moment and that test, track and isolate is not fully up and running as the Government promised it would be, will the Home Secretary make a commitment to report back to the House before the end of the initial three-week window on that first review that she mentioned in her statement, outlining her proposed exit strategy from these measures and her plans for any travel corridors? Can the Home Secretary pass on the message to the Government about how urgent it is that the comprehensive package to support jobs is brought forward as soon as possible?
",2020 Speech on UK Border Health Measures,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/nick-thomas-symonds-2020-speech-on-uk-border-health-measures/
Peter Mandelson,United Kingdom,2015-12-03,"Conference, let me say after these years away – it’s good to be back home.
When the Prime Minister asked me to return to the Cabinet last October I felt a lot of things.
Shock. I think I was as shocked as most of you were.
Surprise. My network of informants had let me down on this one.
Apprehension.  Returning to the goldfish bowl of British politics – and all my fans in the media. It made me pause.
I had been in this movie before – and its sequel – and neither time did I like the ending.
But I did not hesitate for too long.
The pull was too great.
The pull of coming back to serve my country when it was in the midst of the global whirlwind that had hit us.
The pull of coming back to serve this Prime Minister, our leader, Gordon Brown – who was gripping this financial crisis, leading the fightback against it when so many others seemed caught in the headlights.
But there was something else. It was the pull of coming back to serve our party.
I did not choose this party.  I was born into it.
It is in my blood and in my bones.
I love working for this party and those who work so hard for it – even if, at times, perhaps not everyone in it has loved me.
I understand that.  I made enemies, sometimes needlessly.  I was sometimes too careless with the feelings and views of others.
But please accept this. It was for one reason only. I was in a hurry to return this party to where it should be – in government to help the hard-working people of our country.
I know that Tony said our project would only be complete when the Labour Party learned to love Peter Mandelson.
I think perhaps he set the bar a little too high.
Though I am trying my best.
But the fact is our project is far from complete.
A Labour Government has never been more needed.
Needed to fight back against the recession.
Needed to build and secure our future economic strength.
And needed to ensure we pay down debt in a way that is fair and protects jobs, homes and our frontline public services.
And yet, we must face facts.
Electorally, we are in the fight of our lives.
And, yes, we start that fight as underdogs.
But conference let me say this.
If I can come back…, we can come back.
I came into politics to help remake the Labour Party as a party of Government.
My relationship with Gordon was forged when people said we’d never form a government again.
It made us not just modernisers, but fighters… and certainly not quitters.
That spirit still burns as brightly within us now as it did then.
Gordon, I am proud to serve in your Government as you lead the fightback against the global recession.
The policies conceived and executed over the last year have now begun to pull our economy back onto the long road of recovery.
When it mattered, Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have made, and are making, all the right calls.
Of course, they could have made different choices.  They could have taken David Cameron and George Osborne’s advice to let the recession take its course.
Can you imagine if we had?
I hope these two can find the humility to acknowledge that at every point Tory policy would not just have put the recovery at risk but have made this recession deeper, longer and far far worse.
As we get closer to the election, I want to see them and Tory candidates across the country explaining why they wouldn’t provide the money to help small businesses and families in this recession when they needed it most.
No extra money to boost family incomes.
No money for the tax deferment for business and no VAT cut.
No additional money to help those who have tragically lost their jobs.
No funding for the car scrappage scheme.
They got it plain wrong at every step along the way and I say to every Labour member and campaigner across the country.
Do not let them off the hook.
I certainly will not.
Conference, the foundation of all that we want to achieve is a strong economy.
So what does that mean?
It means continuing to limit the recession’s damage to our economy because when private demand plummets governments must step in.
It means, once we are through the recession – and only when this is clearly the case –  we will tackle the deficit without eating into the fabric of people’s lives.
And it means investing in future growth.
On all three counts, the Tories are on the wrong side of the argument.
I tell you.  Withdrawing our help for the economy now as Mr Osborne demands would choke off recovery before it has even properly begun.
Not for the first time, Boy George is sailing close to the wind.
There are encouraging signs that the economy is picking up.  But recovery remains fragile and uncertain, especially in manufacturing and one of its cornerstones, the car industry.
Our car scrappage scheme has been so successful the money is running out.  The industry has asked that the scheme be topped up.  Conference, we cannot do everything but that does not mean doing nothing.  So today I am extending our popular car scrappage scheme with extra money for an additional 100,000 cars and vans.
In support of our car industry too, this government will stand behind Vauxhall workers in Ellesmere Port and Luton where the workforce themselves have been the main driver of change.
And the same goes for Jaguar Land Rover too.
But all of this only makes sense if we continue to invest in our country’s future growth.  It is growth that will see off recession. It is growth that is key to paying down debt.
More than ten years ago I spoke to this conference as Trade and Industry Secretary about how we needed to renew the British economy and build it around knowledge, science, innovation and enterprise.
But this isn’t 1998. This is a different world.
China and India are undergoing the greatest revolution in the economic history of the world.
The greatest financial crisis of modern times also requires us to rethink our growth model for Britain.
Of course, we should be proud of our record.
Production is up by a third.  More businesses. More research. More people than ever at university.   More people learning new skills although still not yet enough technicians being recruited for our new industries at the heart of our growth strategy.
Some people think that Britain is a post-industrial country that doesn’t make anything anymore.
Well, someone needs to tell them that we are still the world’s sixth biggest manufacturer.
And we will remain a modern manufacturing nation as long as I and the Government remain in our jobs.
But we do need to accept that, during this time, we have not got everything right.
The truth is growth was so strong we started to take it for granted. We nurtured finance – not wrongly, but we should have done more to nurture our other strengths as well.
The potential is there in Britain – we know that. In the services sector, the creative sector, the biosciences sector and in hi-tech advanced manufacturing.
But to release this potential we need a clear plan for growth and this is my mission.
First, with Labour in office, there will be no cap on talent in this country.   People with university degrees and skills earn more, climb higher and create more value.
The Tories think that more means worse. We don’t agree.  Britain gains when every person who is capable can get the chance to go to university, get an apprenticeship or a new skill.
But to make this possible in a tough public spending environment we all need to contribute – government, individuals and employers.
Second. I want to see an innovation nation. Science is one of the jewels in the crown of Labour’s years in office. And we want closer links between businesses and universities so that good ideas don’t stop at the research lab or the library door.
We’re one of the world’s biggest investors in Research &amp; Development. But we still do the R better than the D and that must change.
Third. We’re going to do more to put finance at the service of industry by building up new public channels to deliver private funds to innovative and fast growing companies.
Less financial engineering and a lot more real engineering.
Fourth – no more saying: the market on its own will always sort it out, like some kind of dogma.
Instead, in my department, over the last eight months, we’ve said: “this is viable, and it’s important, but the market alone won’t get it off the ground. And we can help make it happen”.
We’ve committed three quarters of a billion pounds to new manufacturing innovation in Britain.
Investing in low carbon cars and aircraft. New digital platforms. Plastic electronics. Life sciences. Industrial biotechnology. Wind turbine development and wave power.
This isn’t us picking winners as happened too often in the 1970s, when more often the losers were picking us.
This is us giving public support to new technologies without which they may never get off the drawing board.
Finally, we’re committed to making sure that the benefits of investment in growth are felt in every part of this country.
The Tories say abolish the Regional Development Agencies.   We say “go for growth, let’s see what you can do.”
This is the industrial activism we need more of in this country and I am determined to provide it.
Where are the Tories on all this?  When did you last hear David Cameron or George Osborne last say anything about Britain’s industrial future?
I would ask Ken Clarke but his mobile phone and blackberry always seem to be turned off.   Or given that he keeps privately agreeing with me, perhaps David Cameron has cut it off.
The truth is these Tories have nothing to say about an active government economic role because their dogma prevents them.
They just don’t get it.
This failure, I believe, speaks to a wider truth about our opponents.
David Cameron has been pursuing a strategy not of real change, but of concealment.
Yes, they have made changes to their presentation.  The image-making department has done its work and done it well.  Who am I to criticise?
But the Tories seem not to realise that change has to be more than a slogan.  The first rule of any marketing strategy is that it must reflect the product it is selling.
And what is becoming more evident by the day is that, in their case, it doesn’t.  The two faces of the Conservative Party are increasingly on show. The one they want to present to the public of a revamped Tory party. And the other that betrays the reality of traditional right-wing Conservatism.
You know, the Tories seek to give the impression that somehow they have learnt the lessons from New Labour and our party’s march back to the centre ground.
Well, the Tories may have skimmed the headline summary of the New Labour manual.  But they never bothered to read the book.
If they had they would know what real change involves.  They would know what a painful process it is.
We in this hall know what it took to make the change. Show me what has really changed in the Conservative Party.
The truth is that the old Tory right that was rejected in 1997 are quietly feeling at home again with David Cameron.
At home with his tax plans.
At home with the barely disguised glee a new generation of Conservatives is showing at the prospect of deep and savage cuts to public services.
And at home with a position on Europe that sees them aligned with extremists and sidelined in Britain’s biggest market.
That is not change.  Its the same old Tory policies.
So lets take on the arguments about change.
This will be a “change” election.  Either we offer it, or the British public will turn to others who say that they do.
Of course, we must celebrate our record and be proud of defending it.  We did fix the roof while the sun was shining.
We can look at the way we have turned around our public services, our record on tackling poverty at home and abroad, our role as a force for progressive social change.  The minimum wage and the new rights for working mothers and fathers.  And we can feel proud.
But let us remember that you win elections on the future, not the past.
Do not make the mistake of sitting back and expecting people to be grateful.
We must not translate the pride we feel in what we have achieved into a defence of the status quo.
Just as we fight against a Conservative Party that is still steeped in the old Tory attitudes of the 1980s, we must not allow ourselves to fall into old Labour thinking.
The British people have their eyes on the future and so must we.
We are the true progressives.
We must be restless for change, impatient to do more for the hard-working people we serve, unafraid to embrace new reform, new policies and new thinking where it is needed.
We need to think like insurgents, not incumbents.
To challenge. To argue for change. To campaign.
To be the real change-makers in British politics.
This is our task.
We need to fight back.  Of course we do.
But to do so successfully it is up to us to explain – with confidence, clarity and conviction – what the choice is.
The choice between a Conservative party whose judgements on the credit crunch were wrong, or a party providing leadership in the toughest of times.
A choice between a party that lurches to the right the second it sees a chance of doing so, or our party that is resolutely in the progressive centre.
A choice between a party that does not understand the new world we live in or even what has happened in the last year, or a Labour Party that knows the world has changed and we have to change with it.
Experience and change with Gordon’s leadership.
Or the shallowness of David Cameron.
In one way or another I have been part of the last five election campaigns this Party has fought.
Let me tell you a secret.  Deep down in my guts I always knew who was going to win. Even, sadly, in 1992.
This time, it is not cut and dried.
This election is up for grabs.
So conference, we may be the underdogs.
But if we show the British people that we have not lost the fighting spirit and appetite for change which has defined this party throughout its history then we can and will win.
Win for our Party.
Win for our country.
Win for the British people.
",2009 Speech to Labour Party Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/peter-mandelson-2009-speech-to-labour-party-conference/
Theresa May,United Kingdom,2019-03-28,"This has been a testing time for our country and our party. We’re nearly there. We’re almost ready to start a new chapter and build that brighter future.
But before we can do that, we have to finish the job in hand. As I say, I don’t tour the bars and engage in the gossip – but I do make time to speak to colleagues, and I have a great team in the Whips’ Office.
And I have heard very clearly the mood of the parliamentary party. I know there is a desire for a new approach – and new leadership – in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations and I won’t stand in the way of that.
I know some people are worried that if you vote for the Withdrawal Agreement, I will take that as a mandate to rush on into phase two without the debate we need to have. I won’t – I hear what you are saying.
But we need to get the deal through and deliver Brexit.
I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party.
I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty – to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit.
",2019 Offer of Resignation,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-may-2019-offer-of-resignation/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-09-20,"Well, thank you very much. Please. We had a spectacular morning and it's an honor being with the Prime Minister and Mrs. Morrison. Thank you very much. Australia is a fantastic country and a brilliant ally. We just spent a lot of time together with our representatives, and they get along very well and we're doing a lot of deals.
And we talked military. We talked trade. We talked about everything you can talk about. And we came to the same conclusion, I think, in every case. But I just want to say it's an honor having both of you here. Thank you very much. You have a truly great country and I don't think we've ever had a better relationship than we have right now.
And tonight we're going to have something very special in the Rose Garden. And based on all of that money we spend on all of that weather-predicting equipment, they're saying, ""No chance of rain. If it is, we'll run right back into this room.
And, First Lady, thank you very much. You worked very hard on this. So it's not going to rain. It's going to be a beautiful evening. And great job. Really great job, honey. Thank you. Please, Scott.
Well, thank you very much, Scott. It's a great honor. Go ahead. Please.
We're looking for a complete deal. I'm not looking for a partial deal. China has been starting to buy our agricultural product. If you noticed over the last week -- and actually, some very big purchases. But that's not what I'm looking for; we're looking for the big deal. We've taken it to this level.
We're taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. China has devalued their currency and they're putting out a lot of money into their curren- -- into their -- into their economy. And they have a very bad economy right now and I don't want them to have a bad economy. But it's the worst in, they say, 57 years.
Two weeks ago, it was the worst in 22 years. Now it's 57 years, and it's only going to get worse. Their supply chain is being broken up very badly. And companies are leaving because they can't pay the 25 -- soon to go to 30 -- percent tariff. And we have 30 percent very shortly on $250 billion. We have another tariff at a slightly smaller number, as you know, on other -- on about 300 billion dollars' worth of goods and products.
So they would like to do something. As you know, we're talking a little bit this week, talking a lot next week. And then top people are going to be speaking the week following. But I'm not looking for a partial deal; I'm looking for a complete deal.
No. I don't think I need it before the election. I think people know that we're doing a great job. I've rebuilt the military. We've -- Scott and I were talking about that. We spent one and half trillion dollars. When I came in, our million was depleted. Frankly, we didn't have ammunition, okay?
But our military was in very bad shape. We've rebuilt the military. We've got one of the strongest economies. Mike Pence, actually, got some -- who is right here. Our great Vice President. He was talking yesterday and he called me. He says, ""Boy, these numbers -- these consumer numbers are incredible."" The retail numbers that came out two days ago, that really weren't reported, were really -- I mean, just incredible numbers.
You know that very well. That's your world. And some other numbers. We're doing very well. Our economy is very strong. And China is being affected very badly. We're not -- we're not being affected. In fact, we're taking in many billions of dollars. And China is eating that. You know, China is eating the tariffs because of the devaluation.
Now that doesn't happen with all countries. China is China, and they know what they're doing as well as anybody. My relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one -- very good one. But we have, right now, a little spat. But I think we're doing very well. Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things.
Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago -- where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you -- that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled.
And this was a blip. So it's been really amazing what we've been able to do. I think the voters understand that. I don't think it has any impact on the election. Now, if something happened, I think that would probably be a positive for the election, but that's okay. I do think signing USMCA on a bipartisan basis with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and everybody else -- very bipartisan -- I think that's very important for our country.
And I would certainly be willing to say that's a bipartisan deal. But I think that's very important for our manufacturers, for our farmers. Even for unions, they want that deal done. And so hopefully that's going to be put up to a vote very soon. There'll be very little cajoling of the Democrats because most Democrats want it too.
But the USMCA is ready to be voted on. It's finished. Mexico has taken their final votes. Canada is willing to do that any time we want them too. They're all set to go. And we need that for all of the -- we need that for our country. It's a great deal. It's a great deal. Thank you.
And we could do, Scott, a very big deal with China and it could go very quickly, as you know. But it wouldn't be the appropriate deal. We have to do it right. And that's a very complicated deal, with intellectual property protection. We have to do that and other things. I could leave lots out and have a deal very quickly, but we want to do it right.
Please.
I assume Andrew is a nice person.
Well, first of all, you know, I look at numbers. I love numbers. And the numbers of Australia are doing incredibly well. You're doing unbelievably well. When we have a deal with China -- or not -- but when we have a deal with China -- because they want to make it perhaps more than I want to make it. Because I actually love all the billions of dollars that's pouring into our Treasury.
Billions and billions of dollars. We've never seen that before from China. It's always been the other way. But when -- and I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.
So, I will say, though, that Australia is doing very well. If we do end up doing a deal, Australia will do even better. And we were discussing that. But Australia will be one of the big beneficiaries of a deal. And, in the meantime, as you know, I did tariff relief, with respect to a certain product in particular coming out of Australia.
And that's something that we wouldn't do for anybody else. This has been a truly great ally and we work very well together. But your numbers are absolutely fantastic. Your economy is strong like ours. And I think we're two real examples of two countries doing extremely well. Some countries aren't doing so well.
Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing -- large parts of Asia are not doing well. China is not doing well. Please.
And Australia has really been so focused on the economy. They do minerals. They have incredible wealth in minerals and coal and other things. And they are really at the leading edge of coal technology. It's clean coal. We call it ""clean coal,"" but it's also great for the workers. And things that would happen to -- because it was very dangerous years ago, and very bad for a lot of people.
And you've rectified that 100 percent. It's incredible. I looked at your statistics the other day and coal miners are very, very safe in Australia. It's incredible what you've done. In fact, we're looking at what you've done. But so --
So I want to -- I want to congrat- -- we'll do a deal. We'll make a deal. Yeah. Go ahead. Please.
Yes.
Well, these are the strongest sanctions ever put on a country. We are at a level of sanction that is far greater than ever before with respect to Iran. Today, we did Central Bank, as you know. And we'll see. We'll see. They're having a lot of problems, not only with us; they're having problems within their own country.
And I think they have a lot of self-made problems. We are, by far, the strongest military in the world. Going into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before, it'd be very easy. The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within two seconds, but plenty of time. Plenty of time. In the meantime, they have a lot of problems within Iran.
Iran could be a great country, could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice. But I think I'm showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it; some people don't. Some people say, ""Oh, you should go in immediately."" And other people are so thrilled at what I'm doing.
And I don't do it for anybody; I do it for what's good for the United States, what's good for our allies. And it's working out really, very well. As far as Robert is concerned, he's -- Robert, maybe you could stand up? Robert O'Brien is done a fantastic job for us with hostage negotiations. I think we can say that there has never been anybody that has done better than you and I as a combination.
We've brought many people home, and we brought them home quickly. Speed is a very important thing, I find, with hostages. It's -- it's really something. I had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family, an incredible family -- the whole family and some of Otto's friends, in addition to the family. We had 25 people over on Saturday night.
And we did that dinner in Otto -- really, in Otto's honor. And it was a beautiful thing. It was a beautiful thing. The First Lady and I, it was very -- you know, it was very touching and really very beautiful. We talked about Otto. And I will tell you that people should have moved faster. And Robert and I were talking about that.
Should have moved faster. He was there for a long time. You got to move fast. With hostages, you have to move fast. All of a sudden, it gets very hard for the other side to do anything. And sometimes, it's just too late. In the case of Otto, it was very late. We got him home, but he was in horrible, horrible condition.
What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible. But you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful. And the reason I know him so well -- I actually work hard on hostages, I think he would say. I think most Presidents wouldn't do that, but I do. These a great -- I guess, in almost all cases -- American lives.
And we help other people, also. We've also helped other countries with their hostage situation, where we have some strength that they don't. But these are great people. And we get them home. We got them home from North Korea, as you know. And we got them home from a lot of different locations. Egypt -- we got them home.
We got them home from many different locations. Turkey. President Erdoğan was very good. And we got a hostage home. Our great pastor, who everyone in this room knows and loves. But we've had tremendous success. And what's surprised me, I didn't know too many people knew Robert. And when it came time to pick somebody for the position -- it's a very critical time -- I had so many people -- I shouldn't say this in front of Robert, he'll be embarrassed, but I had so many people that called me and they recommended Robert O'Brien.
So I think he's going to do a great job. And he was here -- I can tell you this -- he started about 12 minutes after he was chosen. He sat in with us. And he's very much involved now on what we're doing.
Well, I don't want to talk about that, but I will say I think the sanctions work. And the military would work, but that's a very severe form of winning. But we win. Nobody can beat us, militarily. Nobody can even come close. What we've done for our military in the last three years is incredible. All made in the USA, by the way.
And it's really incredible. Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, ""tippy-top shape."" Tippy-top. It's -- we have new and we have renovated and it's -- it's incredible. And we all should pray that we never have to use it. We should never have to use it. And our military itself is in phenomenal shape.
And we have a great gentleman, as you know, going to be taking over Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joe Dunford has been fantastic. He's a great, great man and a friend of mine. But General Milley is going to be taking over. And it's going to be -- we're going to have a little bit of a celebration, both for Joe and for Mark -- for everybody.
And, you know -- as you know, our Secretary of Defense has just come in, Mark Esper. And he's been here for a short period of time, but he's got tremendous energy. He's got it. He knows -- he's knows it. That's what he's been doing for a long period of time -- from the day he graduated, or maybe I should say from the day he started at West Point, where he was a top, top scholar, et cetera.
So, we have a -- we have incredible people. And Steve Mnuchin is here. We did the sanctions today and I think they're probably, Steve, the strongest that have ever been put on a country. We will certainly never do that to Australia, I promise you.
And one of the things -- important, I think -- is during our meeting, we discussed, I said, ""What percentage of our -- of your military do you buy from us?"" And it's -- the answer was, ""We work it together"" --
-- ""or it's about 100 percent.""
It's close to 100 percent. And we make the best equipment. He understands that. But it's a real relationship. They buy 100 percent of their military -- and it's a massive purchase. And it's gotten bigger. I guess, you said the biggest purchase since World War Two.
So we didn't --
Yeah.
Hold it one second. You'll get a second crack. You'll get a -- you'll get a shot at your Prime Minister. We didn't discuss too much Iran. We discussed more trade, more China. We discussed Afghanistan, where Australia is helping us. And we're slowing reducing in Afghanistan, as people know.
We've been very effective in Afghanistan. And if we wanted to do a certain method of war, we would win that very quickly. But many, many -- really, tens of millions of people would be killed. And we think it's unnecessary. But they've been -- Australia has been a great help to us in Afghanistan. But we're reducing in Afghanistan.
We're reducing in Syria, where we had -- you know, we've taken over 100 percent of the caliphate. We have 100 percent. When I came in, it was smaller, but it was a mess. It was all over. And now it's -- it's in a position. And I won't repeat what I said before, with the prisoners, but we have thousands of ISIS fighters from our work in capturing 100 percent of the caliphate.
And we're asking the countries from where they came -- whether it's Germany, or France, or other countries -- to take those people back, put them on trial, do what they have to do with them. But the United States will not keep thousands and thousands of people for the next possibly 50 years of whatever it may be. It's going to be up to those countries.
We did them a big favor. We went in. We took them down. The ISIS fighters, in the end, weren't very good fighters against the United States. But we have thousands of them and we want them to be taken over by Germany, France, and all of those countries from where they came. Okay.
Well, thank you very much. And, Jennifer, thank you very much. Your First Lady, thank you. And I hope you're going to be able to see tonight -- to the media -- because really it's going to be a beautiful evening in honor of Australia and the Morrisons. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
",Press Conference: Donald Trump and Scott Morrison of Australia Answer Questions,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-joint-scott-morrison-australia-september-20-2019
Vince Cable,United Kingdom,2015-11-09,"I don’t want to overdo my Stalin joke.
But I did, I think, capture the pathos of Gordon Brown’s sad decline: from ruthless to rudderless: bully to bumbler; from Brezhnev to Black Adder.
He genuinely saddens me.
After Blair was obsessed by image and positioning.
We hoped Brown would be a serious man with serious ideas and a serous commitment to social justice.
No chance.
Within weeks he was dressing up in a Penguin suit to grovel to a Saudi king who presides over the execution of women for immorality and corruption which makes the late President Mobutu look like a small time pick pocket.
The nuclear power lobby, the airport expansion lobby, the arms dealers all know they have a true friend in Downing Street. And, as for social justice, he stands ready to copy whatever regressive, badly thought out wheeze the Tories dream up on a boozy night out at the Bullingdon Club.
But the real issue is competence. Gordon Brown’s list of disasters is becoming as long as the list of Don Giovanni’s lovers:
Northern Rock; lost data on 15 million families;
mismanaged reforms to CGT and non-dom taxation;
Metronet and the disastrous London Underground PPP;
tax credit overpayments;
the QinetiQ sale;
Railtrack;
IT mismanagement in HMRC;
the collapse of occupational pensions;
Equitable Life;
Individual Learning Accounts;
Film Tax Credit:
U-turns on SIPPs and Company Incorporation
Operating and Financial Reviews.
That’s just for starters.
In fact, the Conservative’s should be benefiting more than they are from the government’s serial incompetence.
They have a problem.
Their own history. Black Monday.
15% interest rates.
3 million unemployed.
Record repossessions.
All that.
Cameron and Osborne have an Alzheimer’s strategy: a fervent hope that the country will lose its collective memory of Conservative government.
These days the Tories simply don’t seem to know what they stand for.
They don’t even seem to believe in tax cutting any more.
Or perhaps I am being a little unfair.
They do have a programme of targeted tax cuts.
Top priority target is a further inheritance tax cuts designed to favour dead millionaires.
Dead millionaires are clearly at the heart of the Tory core vote strategy.
We, on the other hand, have been consistent and right in our analysis of the UK economy.
I warned Gordon Brown almost 5 years ago that there was a growing problem of personal debt, much of it secured against a dangerous bubble in the housing market.
Since then, inflation and house prices have reached levels, in relation to income, unsurpassed in our history and the highest in the western World.
The truth is that just as binge drinking has become one of Britain’s main recreational activities, binge lending has now become the mainstay of the economy.
Banks have become the financial equivalents of a Wetherspoons pub – but with even less of a sense of responsibility.
They make their money by getting people to borrow more than they can handle.
The mess afterwards is someone else’s problem.
The binge in lending has fuelled the house price boom.
Housing has become unaffordable for millions of young first time buyers.
Borrowers are struggling to maintain their debts.
Too much unsustainably cheap credit created an unsustainable ratcheting up of house prices.
People have been duped into believing that acquiring property is better than saving and a more reliable store of value than a bank account, shares or a pension.
Yet this is a market that is, and always has been, dangerously volatile.
After the binge, there is inevitably a hangover.
It is just starting.
House prices are now falling month by month across the country.
Debt arrears are mounting.
Repossession orders and repossessions are rising rapidly back towards levels last seen in the mid 1990’s.
Negative equity is back.
Serious economic analysts worry that our home grown problem of asset deflation will interact lethally with the global credit crunch.
And also global inflation in energy and food prices could combine to create a perfect economic storm.
If there is an economic storm the public will want to know that the ship is being steered by people who know what they are doing.
During the Northern Rock crisis the boat was drifting listlessly.
Captain Brown was hiding in his cabin.
And Midshipman Osborne was jumping excitedly in and out of a lifeboat.
We knew what had to be done.
But the Government only finally listened after months of indecision.
The delay caused untold damage to Britain’s reputation and cost a fortune in legal and accountancy fees.
Now the Government has seen the benefits of listening to the Liberal Democrats perhaps they can make it a habit – to tackle the dangers of our slowing economy.
The Bank of England has to be freed up to use interest rates more aggressively by making sure that its inflation target reflects the fluctuations in house prices.
We cannot and should not try to stop lenders adjusting to higher standards of risk management.
But the binge lenders have to accept some of the pain they happily inflict on their borrowers.
There will have to be a check on repossessions so that we do not have a massive fire sale of homes and a pandemic of homelessness.
No one should face repossession until there has been an opportunity for independent financial advice.
The bank must be required to offer a range of alternative properly regulated options, including shared ownership.
The vultures who are exploiting the situation must be brought within mortgage regulation.
These are, necessarily, palliatives.
We also need to think ahead to a different model of growth.
It should not depend on a debt financed, unsustainable, short term splurge in consumer spending.
It should instead draw on long term investment in this country’s human resources of skill and science, respecting environmental limits and repairing a fractured sense of social solidarity.
But the truth is that in the immediate future there are hard times ahead.
There will be financial casualties.
Neither I nor anyone else can offer a pain free solution as the excesses of the last few years are purged from the system.
What we must insist on however is that everyone contributes according to their means.
We cannot tolerate a two nation society divided between the tax payers and the tax dodgers.
The extent of tax avoidance amongst many rich people has become a national scandal.
The super rich are complaining because our spineless government decided to tinker with capital gains tax.
But they will still pay far less than their cleaners – 18% versus 20% plus 10% NICs.
They will still pay less than half the tax rate they paid under Mrs Thatcher and Nigel Lawson.
But all we hear is a whine of self pity.
Let me be clear.
I have no problem with people making serious money through hard work building businesses and creating jobs.
There have to be realistic incentives in a market economy.
But the idea that the super rich should be elevated above taxation is immoral and deeply insulting to those on modest incomes who pay their full whack of tax.
Then we have the so called non-doms. These are people who, on the strength of having no more overseas connection that a foreign father, can choose not to pay any tax on their overseas income and capital.
And they can avail themselves of a battery of off-shore tax loopholes which enable them to avoid tax on UK income and capital. Probably 5 million people – many in this room – are eligible.
Growing numbers are taking advantage.
After ten years of dithering Gordon Brown has decided to act.
As a veteran of the struggle against Mrs Thatcher’s poll tax, he has decided – you’ve guessed already – to introduce a poll tax.
Billionaire Lakshmi Mittal is to pay the same tax as a non-dom shopkeeper.
Not surprisingly, the Tories agree that this is fair, indeed, they claim to have thought of it first.
Yet there has been an almost hysterical reaction from the City.
How dare British politicians query the tax privileges of the rich?
If we are not careful, they say, Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs living in £80 million houses will no longer feel welcome.
They might go somewhere else.
That’s tough.
Let them go.
We say that foreign expatriates are welcome to live and work in Britain.
But when they have been here seven years, they pay British tax like the rest of us.
Pay up or pack up.
And it isn’t just rich individuals who dodge tax.
Companies are at it as well.
There are only two reasons for British companies to operate from Caribbean tax havens: secrecy and tax.
I salute the journalists who are running the gauntlet of libel lawyers by exposing the tax affairs of leading British companies who use Caribbean bolt holes to avoid tax.
Tesco admitted last week that it had organised itself to avoid £250 million in stamp duty this way, £10 for every UK taxpayer.
While the super rich and corporate Britain uses every dodge in the book to avoid paying tax, those on low pay face higher taxes.
The one certainty about next week’s Budget – because a commitment was made last year – is that 23 million workers and pensioners will pay 20% on their first slab of taxable income, instead of 10%.
5.3 million people will pay more tax.
The Lib Dems don’t want higher overall levels of tax.
We want to see fairer taxes making sure that the tax dodgers are brought to book.
It means that the very well off pay a bit more in capital gains and income tax so that low and middle income families get a tax cut – 4p in the pound of national income tax.
We also believe that tax can be used, albeit carefully, to change behaviour.
That is why we argue for green taxes, particularly on polluting aircraft, raising revenue for our package of tax cuts elsewhere.
The evidence, from the Government’s Climate Change Levy, is that environmental taxes do change behaviour.
And they raise revenue – which we would use to cut taxes in a progressive way.
We should also be using taxes to discourage binge drinking.
There is massive evidence of the damaging effects of alcohol on health and crime.
Yet the Government has cut taxes in real terms on highly alcoholic beverages.
Many will wonder why a government which has raised income taxes on the low paid and Council Tax on pensioners is helping to promote cut price Bacardi Breezers and vodka shots.
Tax should be raised on drinks with high alcohol content – raising £225 million.
We would use the money to cut VAT on healthy, 100% fruit juice from 17.5% to 5%.
This will complete the transformation of the Lib Dems from being the party of beards and sandals to the party of Smoothies.
If I were to be self critical, I would say that we haven’t been radical enough.
I would like to see a much stronger commitment to cutting the taxes of low and middle income families.
And I would like to see a much tougher approach to the windfalls on property and land values enjoyed by the super rich.
Liberal Democrats represent the millions of families ignored by this Government.
Yes we believe in enterprise.
Yes we believe in an open economy.
But we don’t have to go down on our knees to the rich and powerful.
We will stand up for fair taxes.
We will stand up for green taxes.
And we will fight for a more equal Britain.
",2008 Speech to Liberal Democrat Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/vince-cable-2008-speech-to-liberal-democrat-conference/
Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,2019-07-25,"Good afternoon.
I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen who has invited me to form a government and I have accepted. I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service.
But in spite of all her efforts it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad who think that after three years of indecision that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016 and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate and so I am standing before you today to tell you the British people that those critics are wrong.
The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters – they are going to get it wrong again. The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31 no ifs or buts and we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe based on free trade and mutual support. I have every confidence that in 99 days’ time we will have cracked it, but you know what – we aren’t going to wait 99 days – because the British people have had enough of waiting, the time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better and though the Queen has just honoured me with this extraordinary office of state.
My job is to serve you, the people because if there is one point we politicians need to remember it is that the people are our bosses. My job is to make your streets safer – and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets and we start recruiting forthwith.
My job is to make sure you don’t have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line. My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care and so I am announcing now – on the steps of Downing Street – that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve. My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education, wherever they are in the country and that’s why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door and though I am today building a great team of men and women I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see.
Never mind the backstop – the buck stops here and I will tell you something else about my job. It is to be Prime Minister of the whole United Kingdom and that means uniting our country, answering at last the plea of the forgotten people and the left behind towns by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together, so that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband, we level up across Britain with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity, we close the opportunity gap, giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK.
Because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East, but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red white and blue flag, who together are so much more than the sum of their parts and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world for our inventiveness, for our humour, for our universities, our scientists, our armed forces, our diplomacy for the equalities on which we insist – whether race or gender or LGBT or the right of every girl in the world to 12 years of quality education and for the values we stand for around the world.
Everyone knows the values that flag represents. It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law and above all it stands for democracy and that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31, because in the end Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect and they can remove from office and we must now respect that decision and create a new partnership with our European friends – as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible and the first step is to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 m EU nationals now living and working among us and I say directly to you – thank you for your contribution to our society, thank you for your patience and I can assure you that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights to live and remain.
And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU. I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop and it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate and we are forced to come out with no deal, not because we want that outcome – of course not – but because it is only common sense to prepare and let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready at some point in the near future to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control fully determined at last to take advantage of Brexit because that is the course on which this country is now set with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready and the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world and don’t forget that in the event of a no deal outcome we will have the extra lubrication of the £39 billion.
Whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package to boost British business and to lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment and to all those who continue to prophesy disaster I say yes – there will be difficulties though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed but if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years it is not the decisions we have taken it is our refusal to take decisions and to all those who say we cannot be ready.
I say do not underestimate this country.
Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination because we know the enormous strengths of this economy in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services, it is here in Britain that we are using gene therapy, for the first time, to treat the most common form of blindness, here in Britain that we are leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change and produce green jobs for the next generation and as we prepare for a post-Brexit future it is time we looked not at the risks but at the opportunities that are upon us so let us begin work now to create freeports that will drive growth and thousands of high-skilled jobs in left behind areas.
Let’s start now to liberate the UK’s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti genetic modification rules and let’s develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world, let’s get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems – UK assets orbiting in space with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country.
Let’s change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research and let’s promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people and yes, let’s start now on those free trade deals because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty all this and more we can do now and only now, at this extraordinary moment in our history and after three years of unfounded self-doubt it is time to change the record to recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged with the world.
No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country and they will not succeed today. We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves and that work begins now.
Thank you very much
",2019 Speech on Becoming Prime Minister,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/boris-johnson-2019-speech-on-becoming-prime-minister-2/
Andrew Lansley,United Kingdom,2015-11-30,"I am delighted to be here today to talk on the vital topic of universal health care.
Universal healthcare has been at the heart of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom for over 60 years. And it will remain so. Universal access to a comprehensive health service – free, based on need, is part of our social solidarity and an essential basis for improving the population’s health.
When we came into government two years ago we made two very clear commitments. Firstly that we would increase the budget of our National Health Service in real terms, and secondly that we would increase our spending on development to meet our historic 0.7% commitment. I am proud of our performance on both of those commitments.
Across the Globe, each year, tens of millions of poor people fall ill and die due to diseases and conditions that are preventable and treatable. Out-of-pocket costs stop many of these people getting the help they need. The solution is efficient and effective healthcare that does not exclude or impoverish the poor. Governments have a duty to manage this.
In July, the UK government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with the United Nations Population Fund, and others, will host an international family planning summit in London. The aim is to launch a global movement to give 120 million extra women in the world’s poorest countries access to contraceptive information, services and supplies by 2020. I am sure many of your governments will wish to participate. And I am extremely pleased that our Director General will be playing a key role in the event.
Back home our investment in the National Health Service is strengthening our universal primary care infrastructure. We are focused on developing preventative services, on early interventions and minimising unnecessary hospitalisation. We are reforming the National Health Service to empower clinical leaders to deliver outcomes for patients which are amongst the best in the world.  We are giving more autonomy to healthcare providers; but we are making them increasingly accountable for the results they achieve.
We are reforming our public health system, to ensure we are able to tackle the social determinants of health. Nationally and locally, improving the health of the population is a government-wide responsibility. We are recognising and acting on the effects which employment, education, housing and the environment have on health outcomes.
Our approach to tackling public health issues, is to maximise our impact at key moments in people’s lives, for example through support in maternity and the early years of children. We are also focused on the major risk factors such as obesity, tobacco, drugs, alcohol and sexual health. We will be strong and effective in tobacco control. With food, drink and retail industries we are forming a partnership, based on a shared understanding that public health is everyone’s business and that by co-operation we can achieve more progress, more quickly, towards an environment which enables consumers to lead a healthier lifestyle.
We have a busy week ahead of us. Our agenda here underlines the importance of the WHO being the best it can be. We need the WHO to facilitate the sharing of ideas and strategies for member states to build strong universal healthcare systems. We need continued action to tackle emerging and continuing public health threats. When these things happen, we must be ready to act collectively.
The reform of WHO, supporting these objectives, will enable us to make more progress in improving the health of all our peoples.  A strong WHO, ready to face these challenges in the 21st Century is vital.  It is in all our interests to ensure the reforms of WHO are advanced this week.

William McKinley,United States of America,1897-03-15 00:00:00,"To the Congress of the United States:
Regretting the necessity which has required me to call you together, I feel that your assembling in extraordinary session is indispensable because of the condition in which we find the revenues of the Government. It is conceded that its current expenditures are greater than its receipts, and that such a condition has existed for now more than three years. With unlimited means at our command, we are presenting the remarkable spectacle of increasing our public debt by borrowing money to meet the ordinary outlays incident upon even an economical and prudent administration of the Government. An examination of the subject discloses this fact in every detail and leads inevitably to the conclusion that the condition of the revenue which allows it is unjustifiable and should be corrected.
Since that time the receipts of no fiscal year, and with but few exceptions of no month of any fiscal year, have exceeded the expenditures. The receipts of the Government, from all sources, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, were $372,802,498.29, and its expenditures $442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit, the first since the resumption of specie payments, of $69,803,260.58. Notwithstanding there was a decrease of $16,769,128.78 in the ordinary expenses of the Government, as compared with the previous fiscal year, its income was still not sufficient to provide for its daily necessities, and the gold reserve in the Treasury for the redemption of greenbacks was drawn upon to meet them. But this did not suffice, and the Government then resorted to loans to replenish the reserve.
In February, 1894, $50,000,000 in bonds were issued, and in November following a second issue of $50,000,000 was deemed necessary. The sum of $117,171,795 was realized by the sale of these bonds, but the reserve was steadily decreased until, on February 8, 1895, a third sale of $62,315,400 in bonds, for $65,116,244, was announced to Congress.
The receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, were $390,373,203.30, and the expenditures $433,178,426.48, showing a deficit of $42,805,223.18. A further loan of $100,000,000 was negotiated by the Government in February, 1896, the sale netting $1,166,246, and swelling the aggregate of bonds issued within three years to $262,315,400. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the revenues of the Government from all sources amounted to $409,475,408.78, while its expenditures were $434,678,654.48, or an excess of expenditures over receipts of $25,203,245.70. In other words, the total receipts for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 1896, were insufficient by $137,811,729.46 to meet the total expenditures.
It may be urged that even if the revenues of the Government had been sufficient to meet all its ordinary expenses during the past three years, the gold reserve would still have been insufficient to meet the demands upon it, and that bonds would necessarily have been issued for its repletion. Be this as it may, it is clearly manifest, without denying or affirming the correctness of such a conclusion, that the debt would have been decreased in at least the amount of the deficiency, and business confidence immeasurably strengthened throughout the country.
Congress should promptly correct the existing condition. Ample revenues must be supplied not only for the ordinary expenses of the Government, but for the prompt payment of liberal pensions and the liquidation of the principal and interest of the public debt. In raising revenue, duties should be so levied upon foreign products as to preserve the home market, so far as possible, to our own producers; to revive and increase manufactures; to relieve and encourage agriculture; to increase our domestic and foreign commerce; to aid and develop mining and building; and to render to labor in every field of useful occupation the liberal wages and adequate rewards to which skill and industry are justly entitled. The necessity of the passage of a tariff law which shall provide ample revenue, need not be further urged. The imperative demand of the hour is the prompt enactment of such a measure, and to this object I earnestly recommend that Congress shall make every endeavor. Before other business is transacted, let us first provide sufficient revenue to faithfully administer the Government without the contracting of further debt, or the continued disturbance of our finances.
",Message Regarding Special Session of Congress,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Donald Trump,United States of America,1999-09-30,"Let's cut to the chase. Yes, I am considering a run for president. The reason has nothing to do with vanity, as some have suggested, nor do I merely wish to block other candidates. I will only run if I become convinced I can win, a decision I will make later this year. Two things are certain at this point, however: I believe nonpoliticians represent the wave of the future, and if elected I would make the kind of president America needs in the new millennium.
Unlike candidates from the two major parties, my candidacy would not represent an exercise in career advancement. I am not a political pro trying to top off his résumé. I am considering a run only because I am convinced the major parties have lost their way. The Republicans are captives of their right wing. The Democrats are captives of their left wing. I don't hear anyone speaking for the working men and women in the center.
After New York City had spent $20 million and seven years trying to fix the Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park, I stepped in and did the job in three months for $1.4 million. People urged me to run for mayor because they saw I could get things done. A few years later, New York Republicans urged me to run against Gov. Mario Cuomo. Both times, I appreciated the faith shown in my abilities, but I declined.
Why am I now considering a presidential bid? First, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura has strongly encouraged me to seek the nomination, and I highly respect Jesse as the embodiment of the political qualities America needs and voters reward. Given the choice between yet another slate of stale political professionals and Jesse's common-sense principles and straight talk, it was no contest. He has convinced me that we need this combination in the White House.
The second reason I'm considering a run is Patrick Buchanan. He has the virtue of plain speaking, but he often says stupid things--the latest example being his comments questioning whether the U.S. was right to stop Hitler. His arguments are repugnant. Yet they were initially met by deafening silence from the professional politicians. It took three days for Elizabeth Dole and John McCain to react. This underscores the central problem with contemporary politicians: They are so concerned with winning votes that they cannot even find it in themselves to immediately denounce a man who winks at barbarism.
I would bring a different approach to the White House. Those who have been put to sleep by our current wave of prosperity don't want to hear this, but I am convinced that we will soon face significant challenges--challenges we can surmount but that will require a president who is not fixated on popularity polls and re-election. I would enter office with the understanding that four years hence, I would be back in New York doing the job I love.
What are these challenges? I agree with many respected economists that the economy may take a dramatic downturn in the near future. There are no easy roads back, and poll-watching pols who insist otherwise and govern accordingly will only prolong the problem.
I also understand that our long-term interests require that we cut better deals with our world trading partners. This will raise an outcry because we've fallen into the habit of mistaking the easy availability of cheap, sweatshop-produced products for solid and sustainable economic stability. If President Trump does the negotiating, we'll get a better deal for American workers and their families, and our economy will not be as vulnerable to global pressures as it is today. Watch our trade deficit dwindle.
Americans can also be assured that I would never support what has to be the craziest idea in U.S. politics since Pat Paulsen's White House bids: allowing the government to invest Social Security retirement funds in the stock market. Not only would a market downturn spell disaster for millions of retirees, the process by which government would chose stocks would be entirely political, making lobbyists and other political hacks the new masters of the universe.
Our international adversaries would also note a significant change. North Korea would suddenly discover that its worthless promises of civilized behavior would cut no ice. I would let Pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one Ronald Reagan delivered to Muammar Gadhafi in 1986.
I would also immediately reverse the move to normalize relations with the most abnormal political figure in our hemisphere: Fidel Castro. We have pushed him to the precipice with our embargo, helped of course by the withdrawal of Soviet backing. Now comes a movement, backed by State Department bureaucrats, to rescue Mr. Castro with U.S. dollars. The striped-pants set won't like hearing this, but normalization is pure lunacy. If a right-wing dictator like Augusto Pinochet can be extradited and tried for his crimes against humanity, the same treatment is due Mr. Castro.
An upcoming book spells out my beliefs in much greater detail. At this point, it's fair to say that I would center my presidency around three principles: one term, two-fisted policies, and no excuses. For voters, it would be a business approach, and the best one available in the presidential marketplace.
","Op-Ed: The Wall Street Journal - Donald Trump - ""America Needs A President Like Me""",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-op-ed-wsj-19990930
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-07-11,"Thank you very much everyone. Are you a citizen of the United States of America? ""Oh, gee, I'm sorry, I just can't answer that question."" And that's after spending billions and billions of dollars. There used to be a time when you could answer questions like that very easily. There used to be a time when you could proudly declare, ""I am a citizen of the United States."" Now they're trying to erase the very existence of a very important word and a very important thing: citizenship.
They're even coming after the Pledge of Allegiance in Minnesota. I'm proud to be a citizen. You're proud to be a citizen. The only people who are not proud to be citizens are the ones who are fighting us all the way about the word, ""citizen."" Today I'm here to say we are not backing down on our effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population.
I stand before you to outline new steps my administration is taking to ensure that citizenship is counted so that we know how many citizens we have in the United States. Makes sense? We will defend the right of the American people to know the full facts about the population size of citizens and non-citizens in America.
It is essential that we have a clear breakdown of the number of citizens and non-citizens that make up the U.S. populations. Imperative. Knowing this information is vital to formulating sound public policy, whether the issue is healthcare, education, civil rights, or immigration. We must have a reliable count of how many citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens are in our country.
The Department of Commerce sensibly decided to include a citizenship question in the 2020 Census, as has been done many, many times throughout the history of the United States. Unfortunately, this effort was delayed by meritless litigation. As shocking as it may be, far-left Democrats in our country are determined to conceal the number of illegal aliens in our midst.
They probably know the number is far greater, much higher than anyone would have believed before. Maybe that's why they fight so hard. This is part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen. And it's very unfair to our country. The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed our right to ask the citizenship question.
And, very strongly, it was affirmed. But the Supreme Court ruled that we must provide further explanation that would have produced even more litigation and considerable time delays. The case is already in three federal district courts that have been, to be totally honest, extremely unfriendly to us. These delays would have prevented us from completing the census on time.
It's deeply regrettable, but it will not stop us from collecting the needed information -- and I think even in greater detail and more accurately. Therefore, we are pursuing a new option to ensure a complete and timely count of the non-citizen population. Today, I will be issuing an executive order to put this very plan into effect immediately.
I'm hereby ordering every department and agency in the federal government to provide the Department of Commerce with all requested records regarding the number of citizens and non-citizens in our country. They must furnish all legally accessible records in their possession immediately. We will utilize these vast federal databases to gain a full, complete, and accurate count of the non-citizen population, including databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.
We have great knowledge in many of our agencies. We will leave no stone unturned. The Census Bureau projected that using previously available records, it could determine citizenship for 90 percent of our population or more. With today's executive order, which eliminates long-standing obstacles to data sharing, we're aiming to count everyone.
Ultimately, this will allow us to have an even more complete count of citizens than through asking the single question alone. It will be, we think, far more accurate. The Census Bureau can use this information, along with information collected through the questionnaire, to create the official census. In other words, as a result of today's executive order, we will be able to ensure the 2020 Census generates an accurate count of how many citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens are in the United States of America.
Not too much to ask. This will greatly inform a wide array of public policy decisions. This information is also relevant to administering our elections. Some states may want to draw state and local legislative districts based upon the voter-eligible population. Indeed, the same day the Supreme Court handed down the census decision, it also said it would not review certain types of districting decisions, which could encourage states to make such decisions based on voter eligibility.
With today's order, we will collect all of the information we need to conduct an accurate census and to make responsible decisions about public policy, voting rights, and representation in Congress. In everything we do, we will faithfully represent the people of the United States of America. I would like now to introduce Attorney General Bill Barr to the podium. Thank you. Thank you, Bill.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Bill.

It's like as an example, you're a high school student, you flunk out of high school, you're out and you say, you know what I think now I'm going to apply to the Wharton School of Finance. I want to go to the Wharton School. It doesn't work that way, he lost by 19 points from what I understand.
It was the biggest loss in the history of the U.S. Senate for an incumbent and now he wants to be pressed.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-04-19,"Good morning. We're honored to join and be joined today by some absolutely tremendous people and great veterans. Thanks, as well -- and I have to thank them dearly -- but as well to Representative Phil Roe. Where is he? What a job you've done. And all the members of Congress who worked on the bill that we're about to sign. Such an important bill.
I especially want to thank Senator John McCain and Senator Johnny Isaacson. They have been incredible in working with us. Let me also welcome my good friend, Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Navy veteran who's here with us to represent more than a million veterans from the state of Florida. We're also joined by the leaders of a number of veterans groups. I want to thank all of them for being here and all of the tremendous and important work that they do. We would not be here if it weren't for them, I can tell you that.
Finally, I want to thank our Secretary of the VA, David Shulkin, who, by the way, was approved with a vote of 100 to nothing. That's shocking, right. Now, you wouldn't be getting 100 to nothing.
We met earlier today in the Oval Office, and Secretary Shulkin updated me on the massive and chronic challenge he inherited at the VA, but also the great progress that he is making. He's got a group of people that are phenomenal at the VA. It's one of my most important things. I've been telling all of our friends at speeches and rallies for two years about the VA, how we're going to turn it around. And we're doing that.
And, actually, next week, on Thursday at 2 o'clock, we're going to have a news conference with David and some others to tell you about all of the tremendous things that are happening at the VA and what we've done in terms of progress and achievement.
The veterans have poured out their sweat and blood and tears for this country for so long, and it's time that they're recognized, and it's time that we now take care of them, and take care of them properly.
That's why I'm pleased today to sign into law the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act. So this is called the Choice Program Improvement Act. It speaks for itself. This bill will extend and improve the Veterans Choice Program so that more veterans can see the doctor of their choice -- you got it? The doctor of their choice -- and don't have to wait and travel long distances for VA care. Some people have to travel five hours, eight hours, and they'll have to do it on a weekly basis, and even worse than that. It's not going to happen anymore.
This new law is a good start, but there is still much work to do. We will fight each and every day to deliver the long-awaited reforms our veterans deserve, and to protect those who have so courageously protected each and every one of us. So we've made a lot of strides for the veterans. These are, like, the most incredible people we have in our country as far as I'm concerned, and they have not been taken care of properly.
I want to thank David. You've done an incredible job. And you're going to see some of that on Thursday. So thank you all very much. And we're going to sign this. And I think I'm going to have to give this pen -- the way I look at it, we should probably give it to Phil. What do you think?
Does everybody agree? I think Phil is --
Phil agrees. But congratulations, everybody. Really fantastic. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. It's fantastic. And David? Where's David?
Go ahead. I won't look back. You just talk.
Right.
Thank you. Great job. So again, next week, on Thursday, at 2 o'clock -- it may change a little bit, but about that time we're going to have a conference to talk about the progress and the achievement. I'd like to ask Rick Scott, the governor of Florida -- he's done a fantastic job as governor, by the way, and really understands his subject, and really understands a lot of subjects. Rick, do you want to say a few words?
Thank you very much. Most importantly, thank you, thank all of the great veterans. Would you like to say something to all of these people out there? You'll become a movie star tomorrow.
Thank you very much. Nobody can say it better than that, so we're going to end. But I want to just thank you all. Thank you for being here. Thank you.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Signs Veterans Choice Act,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-veterans-choice-april-19-2017
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-10-02,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Look at all the press that you attract. Do you believe this? That’s very impressive.
I hope not. You’re lucky. Thank you very much. Today, it’s my honor to welcome President NiinistO of Finland to the White House. And, Mr. President, it’s wonderful to host you once again in Washington. We’ve gotten to know each other over the last period of time, and it’s been -- it’s been a great experience.
The President and I have just concluded very productive discussions on a number of exciting opportunities for our two nations. Before going further, I want to express our deep condolences over the horrific stabbing attack that took place yesterday at a college in Finland. America is praying for the victims and their families, and we send our unwavering love and support.
The American and Finnish people are linked by an abiding commitment to self-government, individual rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This past May, our countries celebrated the 100th anniversary of America’s recognition of the independent nation of Finland in 1919.” A century after we established diplomatic relations, the United States and Finland remain united by those same cherished values.
Central to this effort is our nations’ close cooperation on matters of security and defense. Although Finland is not a member of NATO -- you save a lot of money -- Finland participates in many NATO missions and exercises. And I’m pleased that Finland is substantially increasing its military budget. America and Finland are also working together to advance stability, freedom of navigation, and respect for national sovereignty in the Arctic.
Both of our nations are committed to a secure Arctic region -- free from external intrusion, interference, and coercion. Simply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic. And, as you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic, and we don’t like it. And we can’t let it happen, and we won’t let it happen.
The United States and Finland are likewise partnering to ensure the security of 5G networks. It is critical that we use safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains. We welcome the establishment of the UROS Innovation Center in Finland. Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with that.
This Innovation Center will greatly expand American and Finnish businesses and cooperation in 5G. We're also glad that the Finnish company, Nokia -- it’s a great company -- a global leader in 5G technology, is developing its cutting-edge products right here in the United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey.
Across the United States, foreign direct investment from Finland totals over $10 billion. Each year, Finnish-owned companies invest more than $120 million in research and development in America, and expand our exports by more than $1 billion. Just today, Finnish Nokian Tyres opened a new manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee -- a $360 million investment that is creating hundreds of brand new, beautiful jobs for a great state: Tennessee.
We love Tennessee. So, they made a wise choice. You never lose when you go to Tennessee. I encourage other Finnish companies to increase their investments in the United States. There has simply never been a better time to do business in America. We have passed the largest tax cuts and reform, and also regulation cuts, in the history of country.
We slashed business tax. And we’re fueling job growth through our record-setting campaign to abolish all of those really terrible, unnecessary regulations. We have plenty of regulations, but many of them we didn’t need, and we got rid of them. The American economy is booming, wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and unemployment has hit its lowest level in more than half a century.
We want Finnish companies to join in America’s extraordinary economic revival. So many countries are coming in. It’s the hot place. We have the hottest economy in the world, and it’s the hot place to be. They all want to be here. The President and I are also working on a way to improve international trade based on the principle of fairness and -- my favorite word -- reciprocity.
I hope that Finland, which now holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, will support our efforts to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement with the European Union. We’re going to have to start doing something with the European Union because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years.
And they know it. And I tell them, and they know it. America’s trade deficit with the EU has been averaging $160 billion a year for many, many years. Achieving more balanced and robust trade flows would greatly benefit both Finland and the United States. We also appreciate Finland’s strong partnership in combatting predatory trade practices worldwide, including the theft of intellectual property.
From trade to security, from travel to commerce, we are immensely grateful for our close and deeply valued friendship with the people of Finland. Great people. And we’re now working on a deal to sell a large number of airplanes, fighter jets -- hopefully to Finland. We’ll see how that works out. But we make the greatest jets in the world.
We make the greatest missiles and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nobody is even close. Mr. President, I want to thank you again for visiting the White House. The history of our two nations is a profound testament to the importance of our independence and resolve to defend it. I look forward to continuing to work alongside of you as we safeguard our precious sovereignty and build a bright future of hope, harmony, and peace for the American and Finnish people.
And thank you very much for being with us at the White House and the Oval Office. We had a very special number of hours. Appreciate it very much. Thank you, sir.
Please.
Thank you. Before we take questions, something happened that's been -- it's been going on for many decades and we came to a conclusion. Could I ask Ambassador Pence to just come up for one second and explain the importance of what just took place? Because this has been going on for --
-- many, many years. And this is Ambassador Pence. No relationship to our great Vice President. Hard to believe. Nobody believes that, but that’s true.
Right?
Thank you. Fantastic job. Thank you. Be careful. Thank you. That’s a great job, Mr. Ambassador. That’s been going on for many, many decades. So, I just want to thank you. Outstanding. John Roberts?
Well, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what's been playing out, John, for the last -- since my election, I would say. If you wanted -- probably, we'll find out soon, but probably even before my election. This is a fraudulent crime on the American people.
. It was 100 percent. You have the transcript. And then, Schiff went up and he got -- as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn’t take place.
He made up the language. Hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown. But he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet -- which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this -- exact, word for word -- he said, ""Wow, he didn’t do anything wrong."" So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said.
It has to be a criminal act. It has to be. And he should resign. And some people even say it was treason. But it was a very sad thing. And just so you know, the call was perfect -- the real call; the call I made. Many people were on the line. I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders -- you can name any one of them -- but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies.
My knowledge -- I know all about it. And so this isn't something like, ""Oh, gee, I'm on the line. Let's talk about a big secret."" This is many people on the line. I don't even know how many. We'll find out, I guess. But many people. Mike Pompeo was on the line. He didn’t say anything. He just -- because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.
But the President of Ukraine, at the United Nations the other day -- and previous to that -- he announced through his spokesperson -- said there was absolutely no pressure put on him. There was no quid pro quo, at all. And if you look at this whistleblower's -- which I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they're real -- his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.
But what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call. Because I don’t like doing that. I don’t want to do it. I hope I don’t have to do it again -- release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders. I don’t want to do that, John. I don’t want to do it again. But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian government.
We got permission. We called up their representatives and asked them, ""Would it be okay?"" Otherwise, I couldn’t have done it. And if I wouldn’t have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report -- didn’t he say, seven or eight times, I said ""quid pro quo""? In other words, ""You're going to do this or you're not going to get money."" Now, in all fairness -- Biden said it, and he's on tape.
In all fairness, you have at least four United States senators -- Democrats -- that said it. And they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it. Obama, when he was dealing with the President of Russia -- not Putin -- he said, ""Hey, tell Vladimir I can do a lot more after the election."" You remember that?
You didn’t make a big deal out of that. Everybody thought, ""Oh, isn't that cute? Isn't that cute?"" My talk and my response -- Lindsey Graham said, ""I never knew you were that nice. I can't believe you were that nice."" He said that loud and clear. It was perfect. It was perfect. Not a thing wrong with it. To impeach a President over a fraud that was committed by other people that want to win an election in 2020 -- which they won't -- is incredible.
This is the greatest hoax. Now, it's gone on for a long time. We had the Mueller collusion delusion, okay? That went on for years. And that's finally done. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. It was a joke, and everyone knows it. And it was from the day one. Now I get three days of peace, and I'm walking into the United Nations, going to meet with the biggest leaders in the world, and I hear about the word ""impeachment."" I said, ""What did I do now?"" And it was about a beautiful conversation that I had.
And just remember this: The Ukrainian new President, a fine man, said, ""I don't know what you're talking about. There was no pressure."" And he said it a number of times. Okay, what's your second question? Well, you shouldn’t be asking two questions.
Do me a favor: Ask one of the Finnish --
John. John.
John, ask one of the Finnish President.
We'll talk later. Sure. Well, it sounds like it might be a good question. Let me see if I like the question. Go ahead.
Oh, I love that question.
It shows that Schiff is a fraud.
I love that question. Thank you, John.
Yes. There’s nothing to finish.
I hate to say it’s the New York Times. I can’t believe they wrote it.
Maybe they’re getting better.
Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before. I’d go a step further: I think he’s probably helped write it. Okay? That’s what the word is. And I think it’s -- I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out. It just happened. As I’m walking up here, they handed it to me. And I said to Mike -- I said, “Whoa, that’s something.
That’s big stuff.” That’s a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it, too. It’s a scam. It’s a scam. Just to finish on this -- I appreciate it. I love that second question, by the way. Should have asked it first.
The Mueller deal was a scam. The Russian collusion was a scam. You can ask Putin. Nobody has been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump, okay? Now, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia. And we will get along with Russia, because it’s smart. But nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
Okay. Ask one, please.
Yeah, please. Pick somebody who is really nice from Finland.
Do you have a really nice person?
I think they’re all nice in Finland.
Uh oh.
Or the other way around, you mean?
I think you mean the other way around.
So the political storm -- I’ve lived with it from the day I got elected. I’ve done more -- and this administration has done more than any administration in the history of this country in the first two and a half years. I’m used to it. For me, it’s like putting on a suit in the morning. People have said to me, “How does he handle it?” Rush Limbaugh said, “I don’t know of any man in America that could handle it.” Sean Hannity said the same thing.
Others have said the same thing, “I don’t know any man in America…” Because it’s all a fraud. And because of that, and because I know that I’m right, and because I’m doing a great job for the American people, I’m very, very happy living the way I’m living. I thought that I would finish off the first term without the threat of people making false claims, but this one turned out to be incredible.
All because they didn’t know that I had a transcript done by very, very talented people -- word for word, comma for comma. Done by people that do it for a living. We had an exact transcript. And when we produced that transcript, they died. Because you look at the whistleblower statement, and it's vicious.
Vicious. And that whistleblower, there's no question in my mind that some bad things have gone on, and I think we'll get to the bottom of it. I think it's going to be a total reversal. But I've lived with this. I've lived with this cloud now for almost three years -- more than that, because it probably started even before.
And I think nobody has done what I've done when you look at tax cuts and regulation cuts, and rebuilding our military, and Right to Try. Right to Try. That means people that are terminally ill and very sick have the right to use our medicines -- our great medicines -- because we're so far ahead of every other country.
So many things that we've done. Our vets are now taking care of. We've got Choice. Nobody thought we could ever get Choice. That's when you have to wait on line as a vet. You go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill. You don't have to wait for three weeks to see a doctor if you're a vet. We cherish our vets -- at least this administration does.
But for many years, they didn't. But I take care of the vets. No administration has done -- and I've lived with it from the day I got elected, so I'm just fine with it. Okay?
Jeff, go ahead.
No. No. I consider when they lie; when they stand before our great body in our great chamber, and they make up a story that's fiction, like Schiff did. He took that perfect conversation I had with the Ukrainian President, and he made it into a total lie. It was a total fabrication. And you do admit that.
It was a total fabrication. He said, ""This is what…"" -- and the only ones that don't like my conversation are the ones that never read it. But they heard Shifty Schiff. That's what I call a lie. And because of the fact that he's -- he's lying about the President of the United States and as to what the President says -- you know, I -- believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully.
There are those that think I'm a very stable genius. Okay? I watch my words very, very closely. And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another leader and make it sound so bad -- it was so evil. And now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible to have done unless there's corruption involved.
And just so you know, we've been investigating, on a personal basis -- through Rudy and others, lawyers -- corruption in the 2016 election. We've been investigating corruption, because I probably will -- I was going to definitely -- but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.
And I have every right to do that. Because the way they've treated me and other people -- they've destroyed people. They've destroyed their lives with a phony charge that never existed. And that was collusion. Never existed. And you had 18 people that hated Donald Trump. And you had Bob Mueller that hated Donald Trump.
And in the end, they couldn't find one damn thing. I could find it on you. They couldn't find one thing about Donald Trump having to do with collusion. This is after two years and spending $42 million. And I've been looking at that long and hard for a long period of time -- how it started, why it started.
It should never happen to another President ever. But I've been talking about it from the standpoint of bringing a major lawsuit, and I've been talking about it for a long time. We've been investigating the corruption, having to do with what they did to my people. They destroyed many of peop- -- many people.
They came down to Washington to do a great job, and they left home. They left Washington dark. They were dark. They came down here, I say, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. They wanted to do a great job for the people. They wanted to do a great job. We won the election. And then, they get served with subpoenas.
All these subpoenas. Now, look at Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like -- you know, she has to approve it. She hands out subpoenas like they're cookies. ""You want a subpoena? Here you go. Take them."" Like they're cookies. Paul Ryan would never give anybody a subpoena. He wouldn't give them when Mark Meadows went in to talk.
He wouldn't give them when Jim Jordan went in. When Devin Nunes -- he would go in, and they’d see Paul. I’m not saying wrong or right, but Paul Ryan: “No, let’s talk about it. That’s a big thing, to give a subpoena. Let’s talk about it.” Two weeks later, they’re still talking. They wanted subpoenas to investigate the corrupt Democrats and the corrupt people on the other side.
Paul Ryan would not give subpoenas. Nancy Pelosi? “Here you go. Take it. Who wants a subpoena?” Every day, you get subpoenas. And Paul Ryan was actually right, probably, because they should never, ever allow a thing like this to happen to our country again. Thank you very much. Please.
If you look at what he said -- okay? And he brought it up. I think he brought up the name, ""Rudy Giuliani."" What I want is the following: And I’ve said this loud and clear. We have our ambassadors here. We have Mike Pence here. Why are we the only ones that give the big money to the Ukraine? We give money to Ukraine, and it’s bothered me from day one.
And you have plenty of people -- just here. I say, “How come it’s always the United States that gets ripped?” Frankly, Ukraine -- we want to help them. And I do like the new President. You know why I like him? Because he was honest, because he said, “There was no pressure at all exerted on me” -- meaning him -- “by the President of the United States.” He said it. By the way, that one sentence should stop this.
But he said there was no pressure exerted. But you don’t have to ask him; all you have to do is read the transcript. Read the telephone call. But what I was having a problem with are two things. Number one, Ukraine is known -- before him -- for tremendous corruption. Tremendous. More than just about any country in the world.
In fact, they’re rated one of the most corrupt countries in the world. And I don’t like giving money to a country that’s that corrupt. Number two, I said --
Excuse me. Number two, I said the following -- and I said this loud and clear to everybody. And, in fact, Rob Portman backed me up, and there’s nobody more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio. Because he called up: “Please, let the money go.” I said, “Rob, I hate being the country that’s always giving money when Ukraine helps Europe and the European countries far more than they help us.” They’re like a wall between Russia and Europe.
They’re like a wall. They’re a big, wide, beautiful wall. And he said, “You know what? But it’s important.” And he -- in fact, he came out and he said that. That was my only reason. Because I don’t like being the sucker country. We were the sucker country for years and years. We’re not the sucker country anymore.
But I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked. But I don’t like to be the sucker. And European countries are helped far more than we are, and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine. Go ahead. Ask a question, please.
Look, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked. And you know it. His son walks out with millions of dollars. The kid knows nothing. You know it, and so do we. Go ahead. Ask a question now.
Are you talking to me?
. Listen. Listen. Are you ready? We have the President of Finland. Ask him a question.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
Ask him a question.
I’ve given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don’t be rude.
I’ve answered everything. It’s a whole hoax. And you know who’s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say, in many cases, the “corrupt media” -- because you’re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it’s corrupt.
And you have some very fine people, too -- great journalists, great reporters. But, to a large extent, it’s corrupt and it’s fake. Ask the President of Finland a question, please.
That was a big win for the United States, right?
You never had wins with other Presidents, did you? But we’re having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became President.
Yeah. Okay.
Excuse me. Your wins are now, because they think I don’t like the WTO, and they want to make sure I’m happy. Because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years. They know that I’m wise to it. We’ve had a lot of wins. This was a $7 billion win. Not bad. Go ahead.
And I just want to finish by saying it's an honor to be with the President of Finland. He's done a fantastic job. Very popular, beloved over in Finland. The WTO has been much better to us since I've been President because they understand they can't get away with what they've been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States.
And please remember the President's last remarks: that we are a great democracy. We are a great -- the United States is a great democracy. And I'm airing what I'm airing because we are, in fact, a democracy. And if the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation.
We would be a far greater when we don't have the CNNs of the world, who are corrupt people. Thank you very much, everybody.
",Press Conference: Donald Trump Holds a Presser With Sauli Niinistö of Finland,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-niinisto-finland-october-2-2019
Frances O’Grady,United Kingdom,2015-11-28,"President, Congress.
Frances O’Grady, TUC, giving my first speech as General Secretary. And after seeing that film, ever more determined that our movement should help build a stronger, fairer Britain.
We are now just 18 months away from a General Election. And the choice that the British people make could shape the kind of country we live in for generations.
If we’ve learned anything since the financial crash, then it’s this: politics is too important to be left to the politicians.
People don’t need us to tell them how tough life is for them. They want to hear the alternative. They want hope. And they want action.
It was five years ago this month, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in New York, citing debt of over 600 billion dollars. A price tag on obscene greed and monumental stupidity that sent shock waves around the world.
But the roots of the crash go deeper still – more than three decades to the election of Margaret Thatcher’s government. When the Right set out to break the post-war consensus.
Once, it seemed everyone agreed that the State should provide decent public services and social security as a human shield against boom-bust capitalism. Everyone saw the value of a mixed economy that put the brakes on private monopolies and guaranteed a public realm.
But no longer. What followed became the articles of a new economic faith. A fire-sale of public assets. Deregulation of the City. Weaker worker rights.
And trade unions, once respected across the political spectrum for our role in fighting fascism and as a pillar of any free and democratic society, now treated with disdain.
The values of a mythical middle England came to dominate, stretching the United Kingdom to breaking point.
The City and the new kids on the block – private equity, hedge funds and share traders – increasingly called the shots. And they unleashed an escalation of greed and inequality that ultimately led to the financial crash. Creating a new Anglo-American model that was a kind of capitalism on crack cocaine.
A legacy we’re living with today.
But it hasn’t always been like this. Whatever happened to the Conservative Party that, over 100 years ago, backed Winston Churchill’s proposal for tripartite wages councils, so that every worker would be guaranteed a living wage? Whatever happened to the Conservative Party of John Major who at least felt obliged to promise voters a ‘Classless Society’?
And whatever happened to the Conservative Party of Theresa May who once warned against becoming the Nasty Party. But who, just this summer, sent government funded vans onto the streets of multiracial London brandishing a slogan last used by the National Front?
This Government seems intent on dividing Britain, Thatcher-style. Between those in work and those out of it. Between the tax top rate payers and everyone else. Between the metropolitan elite, with their country retreats in Chipping Norton, and the so-called desolate North.
Governments may have had no choice about bailing out the banks. But they have got a political choice about what went wrong, and about where we go next.
After all, the rest of continental Europe did not deliberately de-industrialise and make a fetish of financial services in the way that 1980s Britain did.
And today, while workers in many countries have also seen their living standards fall, they have not taken the same hit we have, and trade unionism is not vilified in the same way.
Even from the European engine room of austerity, the German Chancellor still defends co-determination. And her finance minister has called on business to meet union wage demands as a way to boost consumer demand.
Here in the UK, more thoughtful Conservatives are nervous that this war on working people will lose votes. They admit that the Conservatives are seen as the party of the privileged.
They worry that attacks on the unions of ordinary decent working men and women look high handed, cold-hearted and out of touch. To paraphrase Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady, why can’t David Cameron be more like Angela Merkel?
But instead of listening to his moderates, and perhaps against his own better judgement, the Prime Minister is in hock to those who demand an ever more uncompromising stance. ‘Plenty of ugly talk about a crackdown on migrants. But no crackdown on those bosses who use cheap labour to cut costs.
Tough on welfare fraud for sure. But no sympathy for those unlucky enough to fall on hard times or lose their job.
Freedom to raise prices for big business. But no pay rise for ordinary working families.
Decent families up and down the land; facing worries that the Eton educated elite, with their serial holidays, hired help and inherited millions, simply haven’t got a clue about.
And beyond the rhetoric, what has this government actually done to recover and rebalance Britain’s economy?
Invest for the future in greening Britain’s infrastructure? No. Leave the banks alone and slash state capital investment by £22bn.
Back Britain’s advanced manufacturing base? No. Hand out government contracts to the cheapest bidder regardless of the cost to local business and jobs.
Build affordable housing? No. Launch a lending scheme that risks the very same perfect storm that got us into the mess in the first place. And then slap on a cruel bedroom tax.
The government is rehearsing the same old arguments, repeating the same old mistakes, rehashing the same old bust model of an economy built on sand.
I know Conservatives are fond of referring to PR man Lynton Crosby as their very own Wizard of Oz. But what does that make Cameron, Osborne and Clegg? When it comes to any vision for a new economy, they are the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion: No brain, no heart and no courage.
In many ways it is a testimony to the enduring strength our trade union values of care, compassion and fairness that the Right has chosen to put us in the firing line.
It explains why this week they are debating a Lobbying Bill that, far from dealing with the real dirt in politics, is designed to deny us a political voice.
Now, debating the internal arrangements of the Labour Party and the role of its affiliated unions is not the business of Westminster, nor, indeed, of this Congress. And in the hall today we also have unions who are just as proud of their party political independence.
But one thing is for sure. We are united in defending the basic democratic principle that ordinary people have the right to a political voice. That union money – the few pence freely given every week, by nurses, shop workers and truck drivers – is the cleanest cash in politics today. And that whether unions set up a political fund is a matter for members, not ministers.
Because for too long, politics has been controlled by those who already have far too much money and far too much power.
Half of the Conservative Party’s funding comes from the City. One third of their new intake of MPs are drawn from the banking industry alone. And we know what happens when the super-rich get to run the tax system.
In contrast, unions are Britain’s biggest democratic membership movement of ordinary people. We are already required by law to report our membership records every year.
We have more than ten times the membership of all of Britain’s political parties put together. It may even be more. The truth is, we simply don’t know. Because political parties don’t have to account for their members, in the way that we have to account for ours. In fact, the Conservative Party refuses point blank to say how many members it has.
But, I’m pretty sure that David Cameron has fewer members than our very own Sally Hunt or Mike Clancy. And maybe even Bob Crow. So before he starts lecturing unions about transparency, the Prime Minister should take a long hard look in the mirror. We already publish our numbers. I challenge David Cameron to publish his.
But more than all this. And here is the democratic bottom line.
If unions were denied a political voice: We wouldn’t have had the 1944 Education Act; we wouldn’t have the NHS; we wouldn’t have equal pay for women; we wouldn’t have a minimum wage. And remember who first exposed the scandal of tax avoidance?
Who first raised the alarm about falling living standards? And who first blew the whistle on zero-hours? You can see why some people want to shut us up.
That is why we must now stand up for our rights. Not just union rights. Civil rights. People’s rights.
‘The government has attacked the union link to Labour. A link that, of course, will evolve and change over time. But their real aim is to discredit all unions.
And the reason is clear: we stand for popular policies to shift wealth and power from the few to the many.
So if they can’t win the policy argument, then attack them as ‘trade union demands’. If they don’t like what we say, call us ‘union paymasters’. And if all else fails, then try the old trick of smears.
The government may be preparing for a humiliating climb down on some of the worst parts of the lobbying bill. But don’t be fooled into thinking the battle for civil liberties has been won. Unions still will be hit by cuts in funding limits. Many charities could still find themselves clobbered. And, shockingly, one thing is sure, this Bill will virtually close down Hope not Hate and Unite Against Fascism in what amounts to a free gift to the BNP. This government should be ashamed of themselves.
Congress, this is an anti-democratic, dangerous bill, and it must be defeated.
But delegates I also need to issue a challenge to the cynics within our own ranks too. We’ve all heard those who tell us that the next election does not matter. You don’t have to go far to hear people say there’s no difference between the parties, it doesn’t matter who wins, they’re all in it for themselves.
I respect their right to an opinion but I must tell you they are wrong. The result of the next election does matter. It matters a lot. To the unemployed teenager, desperate for a decent job. To the young family, hoping for a decent home. And to the elderly, the disabled and their carers, who know there must be a better way.
For trade unionists to argue that voting is a waste of time is a dangerous game that plays into the hands of our opponents.
Because ever since the Chartists first lifted their banners, the democratic voice of the people has always been our best weapon against rule by the markets, the rich and the powerful. To deny that would be a betrayal of the millions of our members whose jobs, living standards and pay depends on it.
I am not arguing that we should button up and keep quiet in the run up to the election. Nor that we should be put up with a vanilla version of austerity. On the contrary.
But it does mean that we have to roll up our sleeves and help shape the choices on offer. We need to win public opinion to our policies. And we need to prove that they are election winners.
Remember when we first campaigned for a minimum wage?
The business lobby said it would wreck the economy and politicians trembled. Now it’s as much part of the mainstream British culture as curry and chips.
It’s time for us to push the same kind of ambitious policies – to transform our economy, improve working lives and change the country for the better. A popular programme that can inspire voter confidence. A test of both values and valour.
I’m going to tell you what should go on a pledge card. And, today, I challenge politicians from all parties to say where they stand on it.
First, decent jobs.
It’s time to restore that goal of full employment, and give a cast iron jobs guarantee for the young. Full employment is the best way to boost the economy, drive up living standards and generate the tax that we need to pay down the deficit.
And let’s be clear, the reason why low-paid jobs are growing is because people have no choice but to take them. That is wrong. Employers should compete for staff. Not the other way around.
Now, George Osborne will say – but how are you going to pay for it? Well, of course the best way to pay for it is by getting economic growth. That’s why we need to invest in an intelligent industrial strategy for the future. But if the Chancellor wants to talk numbers here’s a big one. According to the Rich List, since the crash, the 1,000 richest people in Britain increased their wealth by no less than £190bn. That’s nearly double the entire budget for the NHS.
So when they ask how we’ll pay for it, let’s tell them. Fair taxes – that’s how.
One of the best ways to create jobs and apprenticeships would be to build new houses. And that’s pledge number two. One million new council and affordable homes. Our country has a desperate shortage of housing. That means landlords rake it in and the housing benefit bill rockets. It drives up the cost of a buying a home, and puts people in more debt.
So cut the waiting lists, stop another bubble and let’s build the homes young families need.
Pledge number three: fair pay – and new wages councils to back it up. Of course the national minimum wage should go up and we need tough enforcement. But take one look at company profits and you’ll see that there are plenty of industries that could, and should, pay more.
That’s why we need new wages councils, so unions and employers get around the table and negotiate.
That’s the way to guarantee not just a minimum wage, not just a living wage but a fair wage, and fair shares of the wealth workers help create.
And pledge number four could be the most popular one of all. Let’s pledge that the NHS will once again be a public service run for people and not for profit.
Let’s make adult social care a community responsibility by bringing it together with the NHS. That would save money because good social care helps elderly people stay at home when they want to be, instead of in hospital when they don’t. And while we’re about it, let’s have a proper system of care for our children too.
So instead of shrinking the welfare state, let’s strengthen it. That’s the way to build a stronger economy too.
And five – fair rights at work. No more union busting. No more blacklisting. And no more zero hours.
Instead we need decent employment rights; strong unions with the freedom to organise, and a bit more economic democracy. We already work with the best employers, keeping workers healthy and safe, giving them the chance to learn new skills, guaranteeing fair pay and fair treatment.
Through the worst of the recession, we made thousands of agreements to save jobs and keep plants open.
And let me say this, I believe there isn’t a boardroom in Britain that wouldn’t benefit from giving ordinary workers a voice.
Of course these aren’t the only issues on which we campaign. We oppose the creeping privatisation of our education system. We want our railways returned to public ownership. And let’s send a strong message from this Congress – we will fight this latest senseless, sell-off of the family silver – hands off our Royal Mail.
We’ve got sensible policies. Good policies. Popular policies. And their importance is that, together, they make a promise of a better future. They cut through the pessimism, and give people confidence.
So I want to end not just by asking Congress to back the General Council statement that I move today.
But more importantly: To unite. To organise. And to campaign.
As the late, great poet Seamus Heaney, wrote: ‘Move lips, move minds and let new meanings flare’.
For the people we saw on that film. For a new economy that puts the interests of working people at its heart. For our values of equality, solidarity and democracy.
So that, together, we build a Britain of which we can be proud.
",2013 Speech to TUC Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/frances-ogrady-2013-speech-to-tuc-conference/
Andrea Leadsom,United Kingdom,2020-01-09,"The Cinnamon Club is always a great venue.
Believe it or not, this isn’t the first Indian restaurant to have caught Airbus’s passion for aviation.
Several years ago, the story goes that a curry house in Filton spent £5,000 putting the cockpit of a Hawker jet inside the restaurant to attract Airbus staff in for dinner.
One to try for next year’s reception, perhaps?
The Prime Minister is sorry he can’t be here tonight – but sends his best wishes for the New Year.
Now – ladies and gentlemen – as Business Secretary, there are some firms that are easy to get excited about.
And Airbus is certainly one of them.
From flapping planes, to flying taxis. From chasing comets, to exploring Mars. No other company is quite like yours.
And while Airbus is undoubtedly a European company – it’s also something of a national treasure.
For decades, the UK has had the privilege – and it is a privilege – of being one of Airbus’s 4 ‘home nations’.
And it was great to hear Guillaume say that Airbus remains committed to the UK.
So please rest assured that we also remain absolutely committed to Airbus – and to the industry as a whole.
In November we increased our funding to the European Space Agency to record levels, signalling our commitment to international collaboration.
Both now and once we’ve left the EU.
Yet, today, we should all be feeling optimistic.
UK aerospace continues to go from strength to strength – with new figures showing the number of people working in the sector rose by 2,000 in 2018.
I’d like to congratulate Guillaume – and Airbus – on another fantastic year for deliveries in 2019.
And 2020 promises to be even better.
A new year, a new decade, a new top team at Airbus, a newly elected government and – above all – a new sense of confidence in the future.
To me, it feels like that moment after take-off when you hear the ‘ping’ of the ‘fasten-your-seatbelt’ signs turning off.
We’re rising out of the clouds of Brexit uncertainty and finally have a clear view of the political horizon.
Today, we have a real chance to build a stronger, greener United Kingdom.
And I – for one – can’t wait to crack on with my department’s priorities:
leading the world in tackling climate change
solving the Grand Challenges facing our society – from healthy ageing, to developing autonomous vehicles and space technologies
and making the UK the best place in the world to work and grow a business
As we build a better future for our country – your contribution will be crucial.
We are immensely proud that Airbus’s flagship Research and Technology programme ‘Wing of Tomorrow’ is taking place in the UK.
It’s a great example of government and industry working, and investing, together, in the carbon fibre wings of the future.
A massive opportunity for Airbus – but also for the hundreds of companies in UK supply chains who help design and assemble the best wings in the world.
So that in 1, 2 or 3 decades’ time, Airbus engineering will still be a UK icon.
Of course, in the future, it’s not just the wings which will change – but the way planes are powered.
Today, we’re just 8 days into a new decade of decarbonisation.
And Airbus already have a head-start.
Last month, they celebrated the first flight of one of their ‘Beluga’ Super Transporters with Sustainable Aviation Fuel.
An aircraft over 50-feet high and nearly 200-feet long being powered – in part – by recycled cooking oil!
In 2018, sustainable fuels covered just 0.1% of the industry’s needs. So there’s a massive opportunity to grow this – greening existing power sources as we develop new ones.
On hybrid technology, Guillaume must have a certain sense of ‘déjà vu’. At the start of the last decade, when he was Peugeot’s Executive Vice-President for R&amp;D in 2011, he helped launch the world’s first diesel-electric hybrid.
And now, since becoming Airbus CEO, Guillaume has led a big push towards electrification – something Airbus can be proud of.
Having legislated for net zero emissions by 2050 and with COP26 taking place in Glasgow later this year, we need companies to find solutions on decarbonising transport.
And through the Aerospace Technology Institute, we are backing the E-Fan X hybrid demonstrator, developed by the ‘dream team’ of Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Cranfield University.
Its first flight next year will be a huge step towards one of Airbus’s most ambitious goals: creating the technology to fly a 100-passenger aircraft based on electric and hybrid-electric technology within the 2030s timeframe.
A breakthrough which would literally change our lives – and help create the net zero world we all want to see.
Ladies and gentlemen, Lord Kings Norton, Cranfield University’s first Chancellor, once wrote:
It is one thing to have an idea. It is another to have the technical … ability to give it flesh. It is still another to have the tenacity of purpose to drive through to success.
He wrote these words about jet engine inventor Frank Whittle.
And, today – we’re at the start of another aerospace revolution.
Airbus undoubtedly has the ideas and ability.
And under Guillaume’s leadership – I believe you have the ‘tenacity of purpose’ to pull it off.
So please know that through the tests and trials, the demonstrators and development, the UK will stand firmly by your side.
Together, I know we can succeed. Thank you.
",2020 Speech at Airbus New Year’s Reception,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/andrea-leadsom-2020-speech-at-airbus-new-years-reception/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-06-17,"Well, I think what happened and you see it better than maybe anybody, frankly, is that we were doing phenomenally well, the economy was great, jobs were great, best unemployment rates we've ever had for African American, for Hispanic, for Asian, for women, for everybody, and it was great. And then, we got hit with the Chinese virus and it was a whole different thing.
We had to close down and we had to say, now we're starting all over again. We're doing very well with COVID or whatever you want to call it. It's got many different names but the disease that came over from China, and now, we have to start again, and we are starting again. We had tremendous numbers yesterday.
We had tremendous job numbers two weeks ago. And I think really if you go back three months to where, you know, just before we closed it, African-American job numbers were the best that we've had ever in the history of our country. I passed criminal justice reform, which nobody could get, President Obama couldn't get it. I don't know if he tried to get it, but he certainly didn't get it or it didn't come close.
Opportunities Zones, historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded for a long term --
Well, I think what I have to do is get jobs back. I mean, if you want to know the truth, I do. I am empathetic. I met with some of the greatest people yesterday. Parents of -- of young men and women who were, in some cases, accidentally and other cases, who knows about accidents, right? But, children that were killed and it was a very sad thing.
No, I -- I feel tremendous sorrow and loss. At the same time, I have to get the economy going again and I'll do that. It's already happening because when I get people's jobs back and I believe next year will be actually better than ever before.
So, I think that tone is a very important thing and I try and have a very good tone, a very moderate tone, a very, sympathetic in some cases tone, but it's very important tone. I'm -- at the same time, fighting as hard as anybody can fight against China, against the European Union who are ripping us left and right.
And not --
I would say that if I could, I would do tone. But you have to understand, I need a different tone. I'm going from different tone to different tone. I'm fighting China and I'm fighting -- because China has been ripping off our country for 25 years, and we're doing great on that.
But I have to say that, probably, if I could do anything, if I could have the time, if I had an extra 10 hours or 20 hours in a day, I would love to say tone. Yes.
I don't like it. I'm not one that likes it. I think we have a history. We have a -- we have a very -- in fact, I was just going to make a statement on that today, unrelated to yours. We have a very, very important heritage and history, and whether things are good or bad, you learn from it. And you know, the expression is you'll make the same mistake again, if you forget your history.
And I think, it's a very important thing. It's a -- it's a very important part of our history. Seeing that, seeing what's on -- you know, in some cases, I agree there were Confederate soldiers, Generals, but they were done after the war in order to heal. This was a gesture of healing.
Well, we're talking about two things. We're talking about bases. We're talking about monuments. The bases are a different thing like Fort Bragg. For many, many years, just many, many decades, century, we had a name of Bragg. Nobody even knows the General, doesn't know much about him, but we won World War One.
We won World War Two. We've done a lot of winning from these bases, Robert E. Lee. You look at, I guess, there are about 11 of them that they're talking about changing the names, and I like, I like winning. I like continuing to win and Fort Bragg is a very powerful name. I believe it's a largest military base anywhere in the world.
And by the way, I'm not the only one, a lot of people don't want -- and the military would like to see it not change. So, we'll see what happens but I would be against it.
If he deserves it, he should. If he has the playing ability, he was -- he started off great. And then, he didn't end up very great in terms of -- as a player. He -- he was terrific in his rookie year. I think he was very good in his second year, and then, something happened. So, his playing wasn't up to snuff.
The answer is absolutely, I would. As far as kneeling, I would love to see him get another shot, but obviously, he has to be able to play well. If he can't play well, I think it would be very unfair. Now, kneeling. I don't want to kneel. I don't want to see people kneel for the national anthem, for the American flag.
You stand, be proud. Put your hand on your heart. Salute, if you'd like to do that, but you have to show respect. There are plenty of places and plenty of things you can protest. I was very disappointed in the NFL when they came out with a statement. I was very disappointed in U.S. Soccer. We support U.S. Soccer and now they go out and they say that you can do whatever you want.
No, we have to show respect for our flag and for our national anthem.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2011-06-20,"Well, the Scottish economy will come back. It's a great great country. It's a great place and it'll come back. And frankly, it's jobs like this that will make it even better and even greater than it is. I mean, we're just showing we have a tour today of the site and there will be nothing like this anywhere in the world.
We're building the greatest golf course anywhere in the world and it's things like this and great land like this that will make Scotland come back much faster than other places.
Well, I'm an environmentalist. I've won many awards for the environment and from the environment, and what I've done to enhance the environment. And what we've done here is stabilize the dunes which is a great enhancement. We've stopped the killing of thousands and thousands of birds a year with the lead poisoning the land, in addition to building what will be the greatest course.
But we've done a great environmental enhancement.
No, no, what they did here was they would kill 25,000; 30,000; 35,000 birds a year. So, they didn't enhance for the birds. They would kill. This was a killing field and they'd kill thousands and thousands of birds a year. So, it was sort of interesting. Some birds groups, originally, they came after us and when they found out what this site was really used for, they actually supported us and left us alone.
So, we have great environmental support. We have great political support. And as you know, 93% and even more of the population of Aberdeen and the surrounding area are in support. So, it's not even controversial anymore. We've environmentally enhanced the course.
No, it's a great enhancement to the Trump brand. We had a man. He built a fence and he was stealing our property because he built the fence on our land. We told him to move the fence, he didn't move it, and then, we moved the fence. How would you like to have a house and your neighbor comes out and builds a fence and he takes your backyard.
That's essentially what happened here.
So, we told him to move fence, he wouldn't do it. We told him to move the fence, he wouldn't do it. So, we moved the fence. But what he did is he took the fence. He took this fence, put it up and he was stealing our property. He knows he did wrong. That's OK. But he knows he did wrong.
The word bully was used. No, we're not a bully. We're doing a great thing. We're spending millions and millions, and actually, tens of millions of pounds and we have a job that's tremendously supportive. We have a population that loves what we're doing. And if you look at polls, it's 93% in favor. So, we're very, very happy with the response.
And it's going to be a great enhancement to Scotland and to Aberdeen but to Scotland as a whole.
No, the weather's great. Royal Aberdeen and all of the great courses that are in this region. They love the weather. They become great courses because of the weather. I mean, look at the weather now. I've been here numerous times. Every time I'm here, it's like perfect. The weather is beautiful. I love the weather here.
I don't understand your question. Say it.
Well, I have great respect for Alex and I'm glad he won the election 'cause I'll tell you, the people of Scotland are well represented with him. He loves his country. He loves the people. And Sean Connery was one of my first supporters when -- before it was so popular to support this great endeavour. Sean Connery, who is one of the greats of the world, not just Scotland.
He came out strongly in support of what we're doing and we love Sean Connery. And I'd be honored to have both of those gentlemen involved in the opening.
Well, I was leading in the polls but I also have a show on New York and in the United States that's a very, very big show. And I may do something as an Independent. I'm going to make that determination over the next year. But I was actually leading in the polls. But I also have one of the top shows on television.
So, I made a decision for a period of time and we'll see what happens. There's plenty of time to think about it.
Well, sure. I'd love to take off my hat. It's actually my hair. You know, I have lots of witnesses. So, it is but, hey, it's mine. It may not be pretty but it's mine.

Barack Obama,United States of America,2012-03-04,"Well, good morning, everyone.
Rosy, thank you for your kind words. I have never seen Rosy on the basketball court. I'll bet it would be a treat. Rosy, you've been a dear friend of mine for a long time and a tireless advocate for the unbreakable bonds between Israel and the United States. And as you complete your term as President, I salute your leadership and your commitment.
I want to thank the board of directors. As always, I’m glad to see my long-time friends in the Chicago delegation. I also want to thank the members of Congress who are with us here today, and who will be speaking to you over the next few days. You've worked hard to maintain the partnership between the United States and Israel. And I especially want to thank my close friend, and leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
I’m glad that my outstanding young Ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, is in the house. I understand that Dan is perfecting his Hebrew on his new assignment, and I appreciate his constant outreach to the Israeli people. And I’m also pleased that we’re joined by so many Israeli officials, including Ambassador Michael Oren. And tomorrow, I’m very much looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu and his delegation back to the White House.
Every time I come to AIPAC, I’m especially impressed to see so many young people here. You don't yet get the front seats -- I understand. You have to earn that. But students from all over the country who are making their voices heard and engaging deeply in our democratic debate. You carry with you an extraordinary legacy of more than six decades of friendship between the United States and Israel. And you have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to make your own mark on the world. And for inspiration, you can look to the man who preceded me on this stage, who's being honored at this conference -- my friend, President Shimon Peres.
Shimon was born a world away from here, in a shtetl in what was then Poland, a few years after the end of the first world war. But his heart was always in Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people. And when he was just a boy he made his journey across land and sea -- toward home.
Shimon once described the story of the Jewish people by saying it proved that, ""slings, arrows and gas chambers can annihilate man, but cannot destroy human values, dignity, and freedom."" And he has lived those values. He has taught us to ask more of ourselves, and to empathize more with our fellow human beings. I am grateful for his life's work and his moral example. And I'm proud to announce that later this spring, I will invite Shimon Peres to the White House to present him with America’s highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
America’s Founding Fathers understood this truth, just as Israel’s founding generation did. President Truman put it well, describing his decision to formally recognize Israel only minutes after it declared independence. He said, 
I had faith in Israel before it was established. I believe it has a glorious future before it -- as not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.
For over six decades, the American people have kept that faith. Yes, we are bound to Israel because of the interests that we share -- in security for our communities, prosperity for our people, the new frontiers of science that can light the world. But ultimately it is our common ideals that provide the true foundation for our relationship. That is why America’s commitment to Israel has endured under Democratic and Republican Presidents, and congressional leaders of both parties. In the United States, our support for Israel is bipartisan, and that is how it should stay.
AIPAC’s work continually nurtures this bond. And because of AIPAC’s effectiveness in carrying out its mission, you can expect that over the next several days, you will hear many fine words from elected officials describing their commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship. But as you examine my commitment, you don’t just have to count on my words. You can look at my deeds. Because over the last three years, as President of the United States, I have kept my commitments to the state of Israel. At every crucial juncture -- at every fork in the road -- we have been there for Israel. Every single time.
This isn’t just about numbers on a balance sheet. As a senator, I spoke to Israeli troops on the Lebanese border. I visited with families who’ve known the terror of rocket fire in Sderot. And that’s why, as President, I have provided critical funding to deploy the Iron Dome system that has intercepted rockets that might have hit homes and hospitals and schools in that town and in others. Now our assistance is expanding Israel’s defensive capabilities, so that more Israelis can live free from the fear of rockets and ballistic missiles. Because no family, no citizen, should live in fear.
And just as we’ve been there with our security assistance, we've been there through our diplomacy. When the Goldstone report unfairly singled out Israel for criticism, we challenged it. When Israel was isolated in the aftermath of the flotilla incident, we supported them. When the Durban conference was commemorated, we boycotted it, and we will always reject the notion that Zionism is racism.
When one-sided resolutions are brought up at the Human Rights Council, we oppose them. When Israeli diplomats feared for their lives in Cairo, we intervened to save them. When there are efforts to boycott or divest from Israel, we will stand against them.And whenever an effort is made to de-legitimize the state of Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should not be a shred of doubt by now -- when the chips are down, I have Israel’s back.
Which is why, if during this political season -- you hear some questions regarding my administration’s support for Israel, remember that it’s not backed up by the facts. And remember that the U.S.-Israel relationship is simply too important to be distorted by partisan politics. America’s national security is too important. Israel’s security is too important.
The reality that Israel faces -- from shifting demographics, to emerging technologies, to an extremely difficult international environment -- demands a resolution of this issue. And I believe that peace with the Palestinians is consistent with Israel’s founding values -- because of our shared belief in self-determination, and because Israel’s place as a Jewish and democratic state must be protected.
Of course, peace is hard to achieve. There’s a reason why it's remained elusive for six decades. The upheaval and uncertainty in Israel’s neighborhood makes it that much harder -- from the horrific violence raging in Syria, to the transition in Egypt. And the division within the Palestinian leadership makes it harder still -- most notably, with Hamas’s continued rejection of Israel’s very right to exist.
But as hard as it may be, we should not, and cannot, give in to cynicism or despair. The changes taking place in the region make peace more important, not less. And I've made it clear that there will be no lasting peace unless Israel’s security concerns are met. That's why we continue to press Arab leaders to reach out to Israel, and will continue to support the peace treaty with Egypt. That’s why -- just as we encourage Israel to be resolute in the pursuit of peace -- we have continued to insist that any Palestinian partner must recognize Israel’s right to exist, and reject violence, and adhere to existing agreements. And that is why my administration has consistently rejected any efforts to short-cut negotiations or impose an agreement on the parties.
As Rosy noted, last year, I stood before you and pledged that, ""the United States will stand up against efforts to single Israel out at the United Nations."" As you know, that pledge has been kept. Last September, I stood before the United Nations General Assembly and reaffirmed that any lasting peace must acknowledge the fundamental legitimacy of Israel and its security concerns. I said that America’s commitment to Israel’s security is unshakeable, our friendship with Israel is enduring, and that Israel must be recognized. No American President has made such a clear statement about our support for Israel at the United Nations at such a difficult time. People usually give those speeches before audiences like this one -- not before the General Assembly.
A nuclear-armed Iran is completely counter to Israel’s security interests. But it is also counter to the national security interests of the United States.
Indeed, the entire world has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Iran would thoroughly undermine the non-proliferation regime that we've done so much to build. There are risks that an Iranian nuclear weapon could fall into the hands of a terrorist organization. It is almost certain that others in the region would feel compelled to get their own nuclear weapon, triggering an arms race in one of the world's most volatile regions. It would embolden a regime that has brutalized its own people, and it would embolden Iran’s proxies, who have carried out terrorist attacks from the Levant to southwest Asia.
And that is why, four years ago, I made a commitment to the American people, and said that we would use all elements of American power to pressure Iran and prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And that is what we have done.
When I took office, the efforts to apply pressure on Iran were in tatters. Iran had gone from zero centrifuges spinning to thousands, without facing broad pushback from the world. In the region, Iran was ascendant -- increasingly popular, and extending its reach. In other words, the Iranian leadership was united and on the move, and the international community was divided about how to go forward.
Because of our efforts, Iran is under greater pressure than ever before. Some of you will recall, people predicted that Russia and China wouldn’t join us to move toward pressure. They did. And in 2010 the U.N. Security Council overwhelmingly supported a comprehensive sanctions effort. Few thought that sanctions could have an immediate bite on the Iranian regime. They have, slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt in 2011. Many questioned whether we could hold our coalition together as we moved against Iran’s Central Bank and oil exports. But our friends in Europe and Asia and elsewhere are joining us. And in 2012, the Iranian government faces the prospect of even more crippling sanctions.
That is where we are today -- because of our work. Iran is isolated, its leadership divided and under pressure. And by the way, the Arab Spring has only increased these trends, as the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is exposed, and its ally -- the Assad regime -- is crumbling.
Of course, so long as Iran fails to meet its obligations, this problem remains unresolved. The effective implementation of our policy is not enough -- we must accomplish our objective. And in that effort, I firmly believe that an opportunity still remains for diplomacy -- backed by pressure -- to succeed.
The United States and Israel both assess that Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, and we are exceedingly vigilant in monitoring their program. Now, the international community has a responsibility to use the time and space that exists. Sanctions are continuing to increase, and this July -- thanks to our diplomatic coordination -- a European ban on Iranian oil imports will take hold. Faced with these increasingly dire consequences, Iran’s leaders still have the opportunity to make the right decision. They can choose a path that brings them back into the community of nations, or they can continue down a dead end.
And given their history, there are, of course, no guarantees that the Iranian regime will make the right choice. But both Israel and the United States have an interest in seeing this challenge resolved diplomatically. After all, the only way to truly solve this problem is for the Iranian government to make a decision to forsake nuclear weapons. That’s what history tells us.
Moreover, as President and Commander-in-Chief, I have a deeply held preference for peace over war. I have sent men and women into harm’s way. I've seen the consequences of those decisions in the eyes of those I meet who've come back gravely wounded, and the absence of those who don’t make it home. Long after I leave this office, I will remember those moments as the most searing of my presidency. And for this reason, as part of my solemn obligation to the American people, I will only use force when the time and circumstances demand it. And I know that Israeli leaders also know all too well the costs and consequences of war, even as they recognize their obligation to defend their country.
We all prefer to resolve this issue diplomatically. Having said that, Iran’s leaders should have no doubt about the resolve of the United States -- just as they should not doubt Israel’s sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs.
Iran’s leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And as I have made clear time and again during the course of my presidency, I will not hesitate to use force when it is necessary to defend the United States and its interests.
As Harry Truman understood, Israel’s story is one of hope. We may not agree on every single issue -- no two nations do, and our democracies contain a vibrant diversity of views. But we agree on the big things -- the things that matter. And together, we are working to build a better world -- one where our people can live free from fear; one where peace is founded upon justice; one where our children can know a future that is more hopeful than the present.
There is no shortage of speeches on the friendship between the United States and Israel. But I'm also mindful of the proverb, ""A man is judged by his deeds, not his words."" So if you want to know where my heart lies, look no further than what I have done -- to stand up for Israel; to secure both of our countries; and to see that the rough waters of our time lead to a peaceful and prosperous shore.
Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the people of Israel. God bless the United States of America.
",Address to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamaaipac2012.htm
David Lidington,United Kingdom,2018-01-24,"On Monday 15 January 2018 I notified the House of the steps taken by the Government in regards to the compulsory liquidation of Carillion plc.
Throughout this unfolding situation the Government have prioritised the continued delivery of public services. Taxpayers should not, and will not, bail out a private sector company for private sector losses or allow rewards for failure.
The failure of this company has understandably caused concern for many people over their jobs, their pensions and their local services. The court has appointed an official receiver from the Insolvency Service who has taken control of the delivery of public services contracts and we are supporting them to do so. We will support the official receiver to provide these services until a suitable alternative is found, either through another contractor or through in-house provision.
I would like to provide further reassurance that all employees working on public services should continue to turn up to work, as they have been doing since the announcement of the liquidation, confident in the knowledge that they will be paid for the work they are providing.
In order to safeguard our public services, we have been implementing contingency plans that have been developed since July 2017. Since I last updated the House, there has been no significant disruption to service delivery in schools, hospitals, prisons, defence and other public services as staff have continued to provide services. We have been engaging with all devolved Administrations with exposure to Carillion to ensure that robust contingency plans are being implemented.
A number of Carillion’s joint venture partners such as Kier, Eiffage, Balfour Beatty, KBR, Amey and Galliford Try have committed to stepping into the respective public sector contracts to ensure continuity of these vital services. Public sector construction sites have been secured and construction will begin following the appointment of a new contractor. I would like to express my thanks to all those who have worked hard to ensure the continuity of public services.
Over 90% of Carillion’s private sector facilities management service customers have indicated that they will provide funding for the official receiver to maintain interim services while new suppliers can be identified to deliver these, ensuring the retention and employment of staff on these contracts.​
At present, seven Carillon pensions schemes, covering 6,000 members, have moved to the pensions protection fund assessment period, this occurs automatically when all the sponsoring employers become insolvent.
Where pensions have moved into the PPF, the PPF is making sure current pensioners continue to receive their pensions at 100% of their usual rate, and are assessing the eligibility of Carillion’s pension schemes to enter the PPF to protect current employees’ future pensions. We have responded to over 500 calls to the Pensions Advisory Service line since it opened last week.
Over 1,400 apprentices have been contacted and the CITB is offering every former Carillion apprentice a face-to-face session with CITB Apprenticeships to find out their individual learning needs. To date, the CITB have matched 400 Carillion apprentices to new employers, and they continue to assess the industry offers they have received to find placements for the remaining Carillion apprentices.
The BPSS connects businesses with HMRC staff who can offer practical help and advice on a wide range of tax problems, providing a fast and sympathetic route to agreeing the best way forward and addressing immediate concerns with practical solutions. HMRC has also offered to provide affected families with cash support through the tax credit system and has published details on how to contact them to arrange.
Lenders are contacting customers and, where appropriate, are putting in place emergency measures, including overdraft extensions, payment holidays and fee waivers to ensure those facing short-term issues can be helped to stay on track. Three lenders have made a fund of £225 million available to support small businesses exposed to Carillion’s liquidation. Furthermore, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has set up a taskforce to monitor and advise on mitigating the impacts of Carillion’s liquidation on construction firms, particularly SMEs and those working in the sector. He chaired the first meeting of the taskforce on 18 January 2018 and will be holding a further series of meetings with stakeholders in the coming weeks.
The official receiver has also taken immediate action to stop severance and bonus payments to former directors. The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has written to the Insolvency Service and the official receiver asking that the statutory investigation into the conduct of Carillion’s directors is fast-tracked ​and extended in scope to include previous directors. He has also asked the Financial Reporting Council to conduct an investigation into the preparation of Carillion’s accounts past and present, as well as the company’s auditors.
Officials in my Department have been in touch with various Members’ offices last week following their queries through the dedicated helplines we set up. I shall be holding drop-in sessions for Members to meet with Cabinet Office Ministers and relevant officials to answer any further queries. Alongside ministerial colleagues, I will keep the House updated on this ongoing situation.
",2018 Statement on Carillion,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-lidington-2018-statement-on-carillion-2/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-02-27,"Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. The trip has been beautiful. We have a very big meeting planned tonight, as you know, with North Korea and Chairman Kim. And I think it may very well turn out to be very successful.
It helps that it's in Vietnam because you've shown something that the world is really getting to see the incredible job that you've done in Vietnam in a very short period of time. Coming in from the airport, seeing everything that's been happening and been built, even since last year when we were spending time together -- my second trip.
You've made tremendous progress and it's a great thing for the world to see. And now the world is actually watching and they're looking at Vietnam. So I look forward to the meeting tonight with Chairman Kim, and hopefully it's going to be successful. We'll see what happens. But he wants to do something great also, and I think he wants to do something that would be on a par.
If you look at what you've done in a short time, he can do it in a very, very rapid time and make North Korea into a great economic power. But I really appreciate the orders that you made today of Boeing and General Electric, and the various other companies that will be selling you aircraft. I also appreciate the fact that you're looking at much of our military equipment.
We make the best military equipment in the world, by far. Whether it's jet fighters or missiles or rockets, or anything you want to name, we make -- we're acknowledged to have made -- we make the best. So I appreciate you looking at that very strongly, and I know that's a decision you'll make. And we appreciate very much that you're reducing the trade deficit with the United States, which was very substantial before I got here.
And now we're bringing it down with great orders like the orders that you made today. And we very much appreciate it. It's an honor to be with you a second time. And we're now friends. I love that you showed me the autograph. That was very nice. And that's the way I feel. And congratulations on the tremendous work that you've done over a short period of time. It's so obvious to anybody that looks. Congratulations to all of Vietnam. Thank you.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Prior to Lunch With Nguyễn Xuân Phúc of Vietnam,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-phuc-vietnam-hanoi-february-27-2019
Robert Buckland,United Kingdom,2019-08-01,"Mr Attorney, I’d like to thank the Lord Chief Justice for what I was going to say was a generous welcome, a frank one is more accurate! But I genuinely very much look forward to working with him and indeed other members of the Bench here present and other judicial colleagues. I’d also like to thank my predecessor, David Gauke, a mere solicitor, for his deep commitment to supporting the judiciary and the rule of law.
It is with the deepest sense of pride that I appear before you as Lord Chancellor. Many of us in this court will be familiar with the long and ancient history of the office, stretching back as it does to before the Norman Conquest. The names of some of the office holders echo down the generations: Becket, Wolsey, Thomas More, Francis Bacon. The names of others are, shall we say, somewhat more notorious, but we’ll draw a veil of charity over that.
I am one of as yet very few people from Wales to have had the honour of wearing these robes. The most recent of my compatriots was Lord Elwyn Jones, appointed in 1974. As the Lord Chief Justice referred to, we share several similarities. First, he was, like me, born and raised in Llanelli, and second, he practised at the Bar, sat as a Recorder and was a Law Officer too. Finally, and perhaps most strikingly, Elwyn Jones took office in a minority Government at a time of great political uncertainty. He did go on however to serve as Lord Chancellor for five years, so let us see whether the similarities end there.
When preparing for this ceremony it was reassuring to recall that I have had some practice – after all, I have borne direct witness, when I was Solicitor General, to four of my predecessors being sworn-in!
Like them, I am before you today, and I have sworn an Oath that I will defend the independence of the judiciary and respect the rule of law. It is the safeguard of fairness and freedom in our society, providing for important principles like equality under the law and access to justice. And for me, this has far more than formal relevance.
Indeed, I realise that this is the first time I have appeared in this Court from this side of the bench. It has been my privilege, first of all as junior counsel and then as a Law Officer of the Crown, to have appeared here from counsel’s row addressing a succession of appellate benches over the past 25 years or so. So for me, the law and its practice have dominated my adult life – I have lived it, which is why today is not just a political pinnacle, but a legal one for me too.
What led me here? As a criminal barrister, I learnt about the power of advocacy; of giving those whose liberty was on the line a voice and ensuring that they were treated equally under the law, addressing hundreds of juries, prosecuting and defending in thousands of cases on the circuit and here in London too. The Wales circuit, the greatest circuit in the known world.
As a Recorder in a Crown Court, I saw the benefit, but also the difficulty, in delivering justice effective and efficiently – which is why I take a particular interest in our courts and tribunals reform agenda.
And, after election to Parliament by the people of South Swindon, which I have the honour to represent, and as the Solicitor General for nearly five years, I saw the importance of the separation of the branches of the State and the role of the law officers in ensuring that the Government respects and upholds the rule of law.
The judiciary, as one of these branches, is rightly independent. Judges must be free to give their judgments without fear or favour. And as Lord Chancellor, I will endeavour to be sure-footed and steadfast in my solemn Oath to defend that hard-won independence.
You, the judiciary, bring huge knowledge, experience and expertise to the judgments you make. I know that these can often be challenging and complex cases. And I want to thank you for the dedication and careful diligence with which you approach those decisions.
This year we mark some important anniversaries. Today is exactly 70 years since the coming into force of the 1949 Legal Aid and Advice Act. Legal aid being provided for the first time in a structured way in certain cases in our higher courts, before the system further evolved to embrace a wider category of case. Having practised predominantly in cases involving criminal legal aid, I remain firmly of the belief that as far as possible the right support must be provided for those who need it, particularly where actions of the state directly affect the liberty, livelihood or welfare of the individual.
And in that spirit, I believe deeply in the benefits of public legal education, something I focused on during my time as Solicitor General and something, I know, my Lord Chief Justice, you too are keen to promote.
And as we mark the centenary of the Act of Parliament that enabled women to become lawyers for the very first time, we can be encouraged by the fact that more than half of trainee solicitors and barristers entering the professions are now women. That is great progress, but we still need to see more diversity, in all its forms, throughout the ranks of the professions and in the judiciary. And I will do all I can to promote this agenda in my time as Lord Chancellor.
The evolution and endurance of this great office of state remind us where we have come from – how our rights and opportunities have evolved alongside an endurance of the essential principles upon which our justice system and society rely. The foundations of those institutions, I believe, are fundamentally strong and the roots of the principles and values we hold dear are deep.
And I will work hard to maintain our international reputation for excellence we have when it comes to our legal services and our judiciary.
Here at home, I want people to have confidence in a justice system that is fair, open and accessible, that protects victims and makes our streets safer – a justice system of which we can all be proud and whose values will and must endure.
",2019 Speech at Swearing-In Ceremony,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/robert-buckland-2019-speech-at-swearing-in-ceremony/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-04-12,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. You must have been looking at today's stock market. Thank you all very much.
It is wonderful to be here in the beautiful Rose Garden. Special place. Special building right behind us -- the White House. And we're going to discuss our massive tax cuts that are growing paychecks all over our country. They're creating jobs and expanding the American Dream. Just like we said would happen, that's the way it's happened.
I want to thank all of the members of Congress here today who helped us pass these incredible tax cuts and reforms into law. You know, for years, they haven't been able to do it. They were unable to do it. Not since Ronald Reagan, and we topped that one.
But they called it tax reform. We discussed that. Right? We discussed it. I said, We have to call it -- not tax reform. Nobody knows what that means. That could mean a tax increase. We have to call it tax cuts. So we called it Tax Cuts and Jobs. And guess what? We got it passed.
I also want to recognize a great friend of mine, and a man who is doing a fantastic job, Vice President Pence. Mike, stand up.
And members of my Cabinet, they are working tirelessly. We have Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Acosta, Administrator McMahon. Thank you. Please, stand up. And congressmen and women, thank you very much.
Most especially, I want to thank all of the American workers in the audience -- we have a lot of them -- who have traveled here from all over the country. They wanted to be with us. This event is dedicated to you: the hardworking Americans who make our nation run. You love your country, you provide for your family, you're proud of everything you've done, you've got that great extra strength that other people don't have, and you cherish a wonderful thing called our great American flag.
And now, because of our tax cuts, you can keep more of your hard-earned money. Larry Kudlow is very happy about that, sitting in the front row. Right, Larry? Good. He says, Yes.
Married couples won't pay a dime of income tax on their first $24,000 of income. A typical family of four earning $75,000 a year will see their tax bill slashed in half. Nobody thought they'd ever see that -- have a lot more money to spend.
And we didn't get one Democratic vote. That's tough. In fact, I have to say, they want to increase your taxes. If they ever got into power, they have stated that they want to increase your taxes and spend money on things that you don't even want to know about.
So we've doubled, very importantly, the child tax credit. They want so many other things, and people have wanted other things. And, frankly, we fought very hard.
We've taken care of our military for the first time in many, many years -- $700 billion dollars. And can you think of a better time to have it? Right? This is when we need it. And next year, $716 billion. Also in that bill, $6 billion for opioids and helping us out with that horrible, horrible problem.
The fact is, we don't care about the donors and the special interests. We only care about you, and your family, and really making America great again. That's what we care about. That's why we're here.
From the day I took the oath of office, I've been fighting to drain the swamp. And sometimes it may not look like it, but, believe me, we are draining the swamp. And there are a lot of unhappy people. You can see that every day. All you have to do is turn on the news. Every time you see me hit, you know that I'm draining the swamp.
But we're also defending the American worker. We're making incredible trade deals. We're taking NAFTA -- one of the worst deals ever made in the history of trade -- and we are redoing it. And it will be a fair deal for the Americans.
We lost thousands of factories and millions of jobs because of NAFTA -- thousands. Think of it: Thousands of factories, millions of jobs. We're turning it around. Already, Chrysler is coming back with auto plants. Many companies are now in Michigan, Ohio, different places, Pennsylvania. They're building beautiful, brand new auto plants. Nobody thought they'd ever see that happen.
We've created 3 million new jobs since the election. Unemployment claims are at their lowest level in nearly 50 years. Think of that -- 50 years.
Something I'm very proud about, unemployment rates for Hispanics and African-Americans have reached the lowest levels ever recorded. Ever recorded. Think of that.
Remember I used to say at rallies, What do you have to lose? Guess what? What do you have to lose? You have the lowest levels ever recorded for African Americans, Hispanics. I'm very, very happy about that. And, by the way, for women, the lowest levels in 19 years. So we have really good numbers.
And something a lot of people didn't think was going to happen -- wages are rising at the fastest pace in over a decade. We're cutting record numbers of regulations. We've cut more regulations in a year and a quarter than any administration, whether it's 4 years, 8 years, or, in one case, 16 years. Should we go back to 16 years? Should we do that? Congressmen, can we have that extended.
You know, the last time I jokingly said that, the papers started saying, He's got despotic tendencies. No, I'm not looking to do it. That's okay.
We're also unleashing American energy and American energy independence. We're now an exporter of energy. We're doing 10 -- think of this -- 10 million barrels a day. Nobody thought they'd see this. Ten million. In fact, it's going to now be 10.6 million.
We're cracking down on unfair trade deals. We're taking strong action to secure our border, stop illegal immigration and restore the rule of law, and we've passed the biggest tax cut and reform in American history.
More than 5 million workers have already received a tax cut bonus, a pay raise, or a new job thanks to these really massive tax cuts. No one has been more energized by our tax cuts than American manufacturers.
With us today is the President of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jay Timmons. Where's Jay? Jay. Stand up, Jay.
For 20 years, their organization has surveyed American manufacturers. All over the country they survey. And it's a great organization. And they have never before seen the levels of optimism that our tax cuts have delivered. Is that a correct statement, Jay? It's dangerous to ask you that, because if you say no, I have a problem. It's true. So true.
In fact, today there is even more good news, and I wanted all of you to be the first to hear it: According to the latest survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, projected job growth for American manufacturing has just reached a new all-time high.
So you think about that -- the oil at 10 million barrels and you think about the manufacturing. All you used to hear is that we're losing our manufacturing jobs; jobs are being taken out of the country. They're coming back and they're coming back fast. Projections for capital investment and wage growth have also set new all-time records, and we're just getting started.
There is enthusiasm like we've never seen before. Companies from all over the world are coming back to the United States. Apple is investing $350 billion -- with a B -- $350 billion in an incredible campus and plants. So many other companies -- far too many to name -- and what they're really doing is giving their workers thousands and thousands of dollars of bonuses -- something that we never really expected.
Nobody thought of it. We did the tax cuts. We thought you'd have to wait until February. But you started seeing them very early because hundreds and even, actually, thousands of companies were giving massive numbers of whatever you want to call it.
What would you call it, Mike? The thousands of dollars; what would you call that? We can't say it's a gift because they're workers. We can't say it's a tax because it's not a tax. But they were getting a lot of money and every -- I mean so many -- and a lot of companies didn't want to do it and the people working for the companies said, What about us? And they did it. They had no choice.
. And I will say, this is about tax cuts today, but the cutting of regulations could have had the same or even a bigger impact on our economy. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.
People were stuck. They'd have a factory; it would be under review for 10 years, 12 years, and then get rejected. You've seen what we've done with the pipelines and so many business all over our country that are being approved rapidly.
We're getting highway approvals down from 20, 17, 15, 12, 10 years. We're getting them down to one year and two years. We're going to get the highways approved quickly. We're going to get our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools.
No more waiting 18 to 20 years to get an approval and then, by the way, they don't get the approval. And you may not get the approval, but it's going to be quick. It will be a quick rejection.
And we will take care of our environment. Remember that. We'll take just as good, if not better, care of our environment. And we'll have better roads, and better bridges, and better schools.
We're bringing back our factories, we're bringing back our jobs, and we're bringing back those four really beautiful words that you don't hear very much. We used to hear that, 30 years ago. Do you remember. We're bringing it back. We used to hear that all the time. Now you're starting to hear it again. We know that.
Today, we have workers here from almost 50 American companies. I'd like to invite a few of you up here -- and you're already up for the most part -- to share with the American people and with all of the folks that are here how the tax cuts have improved your lives.
And we've had some incredible -- we've had some incredible stories, actually. Joining us today are Derek Leathers and Quinton Ward with Werner Trucking in Omaha, Nebraska. Great place, great state. Where are you, Derek? Derek. Derek. Oh, he's a big guy. Come here, Derek. Please.
Thank you very much. That's beautiful.
That's beautiful. And, you know, very importantly, the roads are getting a lot better. Did you notice? Those roads are getting better. The truckers were not too happy with the roads. They're getting a lot better.
Also with us is Brittany Saxton, the owner of Six Hundred Downtown, a pizzeria in Bellefontaine, Ohio. I hear it's great pizza, too. I heard from a friend of mine -- they say it's great. Where is the pizza. Brittany, how good is the pizza? I've heard great things. You have to bring it with you next time. Right?
So, Brittany, tell us about what the tax cuts have done for your business, and what they've done for your family and you. Please. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Brittany. Appreciate it. And, I don't know, did you do any work in any of my buildings out in Las Vegas? Where are they? Where are they? Huh?
Any time I'll take you. Richard, John -- say something, please. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
It's beautiful. Finally, will you please welcome Nicole Bergstrom and Brandon McMillen with Smithcraft Signs in Phoenix, Arizona. They have a great story to tell. Thank you.
Thank you very much. That's so beautiful. Thank you very much.
Thank you. After you. Please.
Thank you very much. That's beautiful. Thank you. Well, thank you all for sharing your stories. They're great stories and great success too. And I know we'll see you in the years to come -- bigger, and better, and stronger than ever. I really -- I believe that. All of you, great stories. Thank you.
I'm proud to announce that we're getting along very well with respect to the whole very big negotiation that we're having with China. For many years, our country has been very much taken advantage of. I don't blame China; I blame our representatives, frankly. Too bad we couldn't have done it the other way around. But it didn't work that way.
So China is negotiating with us very hard, very long, and we've made a lot of progress for opening it up and for getting rid of those tariffs. And I think you're going to see some tremendous business openings.
President Xi, who is a friend of mine, and a man I like very much -- I think he actually likes me very much also, believe it or not -- but he is for China; I'm for us. That's the way it works.
But he announced yesterday that he'll be opening it up. A lot of barriers coming down. Tremendous market. And let's see if we're going to do it in a very friendly way. I think we will. I think it'll end up -- the tariffs off and the barriers down.
You know, as an example, if they sell a car into the United States under the old system -- but it's currently going, but I think we'll make a lot of progress -- they sell it -- they pay almost no tax, 2.5 percent. We sell a car into China -- number one, they have a barrier; they don't want them. They want you to build the plant there. That's bad. But if you do get it through, it's 25 percent.
So we get 2.5 percent, they get 25 percent. Somehow that formula doesn't work too well. Larry taught me that a long time ago. And it's going to be great for China; it's going to be great for us. I think it's going to work out really well.
NAFTA, the same thing. We're negotiating with Canada, with Mexico, and we've made a lot of progress. We'll see how it all works out.
The European Union, same thing. They have tremendous barriers. We can't do business. It's very hard to do business. We lost $151 billion in trade deficits last year. European Union -- sounds innocent, but it's been not good for us. So we're renegotiating that whole deal. All of this is going to mean a lot of business, a lot of tremendous business for our country.
So America's greatest treasure, by far, is our people. And my administration hears your voice and we have your back. We have your back.
We're fighting to give every American -- all over the country, every single American -- a future of dignity and purpose and of pride. Because the jobs that just weren't doing it, they weren't there, they were being stolen. They were leaving our country. Companies were leaving and they were firing. Now they're coming back and they're hiring. And that's the way we want it.
We're going to have tremendous growth in this country. You're going to be so proud of it. We were proud of our country anyway, but now you're going to really be proud of it. Because that American spirit is back. It really is back.
It's the same spirit that linked our nation with railroads and highways, that dug out the great Panama Canal, and that put a man on the face of the moon.
America was built by men and women like you who never give in, never give up, and never, ever stop believing in that great American Dream.
We are the ones who are shaping our own destiny. You are the ones who are, truly, bringing and making America first again. And you are the ones that are taking us to levels that we have never seen before. That's what's happening right now. You're bringing our country to levels that we have never, ever seen before.
So I want to thank everybody for being with us today. And God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

James Monroe,United States of America,1820-11-14 00:00:00,"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
In communicating to you a just view of public affairs at the commencement of your present labors, I do it with great satisfaction, because, taking all circumstances into consideration which claim attention, I see much cause to rejoice in the felicity of our situation. In making this remark I do not wish to be understood to imply that an unvaried prosperity is to be seen in every interest of this great community. In the progress of a nation inhabiting a territory of such vast extent and great variety of climate, every portion of which is engaged in foreign commerce and liable to be affected in some degree by the changes which occur in the condition and regulations of foreign countries, it would be strange if the produce of our soil and the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizens received at all times and in every quarter an uniform and equal encouragement. This would be more than we would have a right to expect under circumstances the most favorable. 
Pressures on certain interests, it is admitted, have been felt; but allowing to these their greatest extent, they detract but little from the force of the remarks already made. In forming a just estimate of our present situation it is proper to look at the whole in the outline as well as in the detail. A free, virtuous, and enlightened people know well the great principles and causes on which their happiness depends, and even those who suffer most occasionally in their transitory concerns find great relief under their sufferings from the blessings which they otherwise enjoy and in the consoling and animating hope which they administer. 
From whence do these pressures come? Not from a Government which is founded by, administered for, and supported by the people. We trace them to the peculiar character of the epoch in which we live, and to the extraordinary occurrences which have signalized it. The convulsions with which several of the powers of Europe have been shaken and the long and destructive wars in which all were engaged, with their sudden transition to a state of peace, presenting in the 1st instance unusual encouragement to our commerce and withdrawing it in the second even within its wonted limit, could not fail to be sensibly felt here. The station, too, which we had to support through this long conflict, compelled as we were finally to become a party to it with a principal power, and to make great exertions, suffer heavy losses, and to contract considerable debts, disturbing the ordinary course of affairs by augmenting to a vast amount the circulating medium, and thereby elevating at one time the price of every article above a just standard and depressing it at another below it, had likewise its due effect.
It is manifest that the pressures of which we complain have proceeded in a great measure from these causes. When, then, we take into view the prosperous and happy condition of our country in all the great circumstances which constitute the felicity of a nation - every individual in the full enjoyment of all his rights, the Union blessed with plenty and rapidly rising to greatness under a National Government which operates with complete effect in every part without being felt in any except by the ample protection which it affords, and under State governments which perform their equal share, according to a wise distribution of power between them, in promoting the public happiness - it is impossible to behold so gratifying, so glorious a spectacle without being penetrated with the most profound and grateful acknowledgments to the Supreme Author of All Good for such manifold and inestimable blessings. 
Deeply impressed with these sentiments, I can not regard the pressures to which I have adverted otherwise than in the light of mild and instructive admonitions, warning us of dangers to be shunned in future, teaching us lessons of economy corresponding with the simplicity and purity of our institutions and best adapted to their support, evincing the connection and dependence which the various parts of our happy Union have on each other, thereby augmenting daily our social incorporation and adding by its strong ties new strength and vigor to the political; opening a wider range, and with new encouragement, to the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizens at home and abroad, and more especially by the multiplied proofs which it has accumulated of the great perfection of our most excellent system of Government, the powerful instrument in the hands of our All-merciful Creator in securing to us these blessings. 
Happy as our situation is, it does not exempt us from solicitude and care for the future. On the contrary, as the blessings which we enjoy are great, proportionably great should be our vigilance, zeal, and activity to preserve them. Foreign wars may again expose us to new wrongs, which would impose on us new duties for which we ought to be prepared. The state of Europe is unsettled, and how long peace may be preserved is altogether uncertain; in addition to which we have interests of our own to adjust which will require particular attention. A correct view of our relations with each power will enable you to form a just idea of existing difficulties, and of the measures of precaution best adapted to them.
Respecting our relations with Spain nothing explicit can now be communicated. On the adjournment of Congress in May last the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid was instructed to inform the Government of Spain that if His Catholic Majesty should then ratify the treaty this Government would accept the ratification so far as to submit to the decision of the Senate the question whether such ratification should be received in exchange for that of the United States heretofore given.
By letters from the minister of the United States to the Secretary of State it appears that a communication in conformity with his instructions had been made to the Government of Spain, and that the Cortes had the subject under consideration. The result of the deliberations of that body, which is daily expected, will be made known to Congress as soon as it is received. The friendly sentiment which was expressed on the part of the United States in the message of the 9th of May last is still entertained for Spain. 
Among the causes of regret, however, which are inseparable from the delay attending this transaction it is proper to state that satisfactory information has been received that measures have been recently adopted by designing persons to convert certain parts of the Province of East Florida into depots for the reception of foreign goods, from whence to smuggle them into the United States. By opening a port within the limits of Florida, immediately on our boundary where there was no settlement, the object could not be misunderstood. An early accommodation of differences will, it is hoped, prevent all such fraudulent and pernicious practices, and place the relations of the two countries on a very amicable and permanent basis. 
The commercial relations between the United States and the British colonies in the West Indies and on this continent have undergone no change, the British Government still preferring to leave that commerce under the restriction heretofore imposed on it on each side. It is satisfactory to recollect that the restraints resorted to by the United States were defensive only, intended to prevent a monopoly under British regulations in favor of Great Britain, as it likewise is to know that the experiment is advancing in a spirit of amity between the parties. 
The question depending between the United States and Great Britain respecting the construction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent has been referred by both Governments to the decision of the Emperor of Russia, who has accepted the umpirage. 
An attempt has been made with the Government of France to regulate by treaty the commerce between the two countries on the principle of reciprocity and equality. By the last communication from the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, to whom full power had been given, we learn that the negotiation has been commenced there; but serious difficulties having occurred, the French Government had resolved to transfer it to the United States, for which purpose the minister plenipotentiary of France had been ordered to repair to this city, and whose arrival might soon be expected. It is hoped that this important interest may be arranged on just conditions and in a manner equally satisfactory to both parties. It is submitted to Congress to decide, until such arrangement is made, how far it may be proper, on the principle of the act of the last session which augmented the tonnage duty on French vessels, to adopt other measures for carrying more completely into effect the policy of that act.
The act referred to, which imposed new tonnage on French vessels, having been in force from and after the first day of July, it has happened that several vessels of that nation which had been dispatched from France before its existence was known have entered the ports of the United States, and been subject to its operation, without that previous notice which the general spirit of our laws gives to individuals in similar cases. The object of that law having been merely to countervail the inequalities which existed to the disadvantage of the United States in their commercial intercourse with France, it is submitted also to the consideration of Congress whether, in the spirit of amity and conciliation which it is no less the inclination than the policy of the United States to preserve in their intercourse with other powers, it may not be proper to extend relief to the individuals interested in those cases by exempting from the operation of the law all those vessels which have entered our ports without having had the means of previously knowing the existence of the additional duty. 
The contest between Spain and the colonies, according to the most authentic information, is maintained by the latter with improved success. The unfortunate divisions which were known to exist some time since at Buenos Ayres it is understood still prevail. In no part of South America has Spain made any impression on the colonies, while in many parts, and particularly in Venezuela and New Grenada, the colonies have gained strength and acquired reputation, both for the management of the war in which they have been successful and for the order of the internal administration. 
The late change in the Government of Spain, by the reestablishment of the constitution of 1812, is an event which promises to be favorable to the revolution. Under the authority of the Cortes the Congress of Angostura was invited to open a negotiation for the settlement of differences between the parties, to which it was replied that they would willingly open the negotiation provided the acknowledgment of their independence was made its basis, but not otherwise. 
No facts are known to this Government to warrant the belief that any of the powers of Europe will take part in the contest, whence it may be inferred, considering all circumstances which must have weight in producing the result, that an adjustment will finally take place on the basis proposed by the colonies. To promote that result by friendly counsels with other powers, including Spain herself, has been the uniform policy of this Government. 
In looking to the internal concerns of our country you will, I am persuaded, derive much satisfaction from a view of the several objects to which, in the discharge of your official duties, your attention will be drawn. Among these none holds a more important place than the public revenue, from the direct operation of the power by which it is raised on the people, and by its influence in giving effect to every other power of the Government. The revenue depends on the resources of the country, and the facility by which the amount required is raised is a strong proof of the extent of the resources and of the efficiency of the Government. 
On [1820-09-30], it amounted to $91,993,883, having been reduced in that interval by payments $66,879,165. During this term the expenses of the Government of the United States were likewise defrayed in every branch of the civil, military, and naval establishments; the public edifices in this city have been rebuilt with considerable additions; extensive fortifications have been commenced, and are in a train of execution; permanent arsenals and magazines have been erected in various parts of the Union; our Navy has been considerably augmented, and the ordnance, munitions of war, and stores of the Army and Navy, which were much exhausted during the war, have been replenished. 
By the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the execution of such extensive and important operations in so short a time a just estimate may be formed of the great extent of our national resources. The demonstration is the more complete and gratifying when it is recollected that the direct tax and excise were repealed soon after the termination of the late war, and that the revenue applied to these purposes has been derived almost wholly from other sources. 
The receipts into the Treasury from every source to the 30th of September last have amounted to $16,794,107.66, whilst the public expenditures to the same period amounted to $16,871,534.72, leaving in the Treasury on that day a sum estimated at $1.95M. for the probable receipts of the following year I refer you to the statement which will be transmitted from the Treasury. 
The sum of $3M authorized to be raised by loan by an act of the last session of Congress has been obtained upon terms advantageous to the Government, indicating not only an increased confidence in the faith of the nation, but the existence of a large amount of capital seeking that mode of investment at a rate of interest not exceeding 5% per annum. 
It is proper to add that there is now due to the Treasury for the sale of public lands $22,996,545. In bringing this subject to view I consider it my duty to submit to Congress whether it may not be advisable to extend to the purchasers of these lands, in consideration of the unfavorable change which has occurred since the sales, a reasonable indulgence. It is known that the purchases were made when the price of every article had risen to its greatest height, and the installments are becoming due at a period of great depression. It is presumed that some plan may be devised by the wisdom of Congress, compatible with the public interest, which would afford great relief to these purchasers.
Considerable progress has been made during the present season in examining the coast and its various bays and other inlets, in the collection of materials, and in the construction of fortifications for the defense of the Union at several of the positions at which it has been decided to erect such works. At Mobile Point and Dauphin Island, and at the Rigolets, leading to Lake Pontchartrain, materials to a considerable amount have been collected, and all the necessary preparations made for the commencement of the works. At Old Point Comfort, at the mouth of the James River, and at the Rip-Rap, on the opposite shore in the Chesapeake Bay, materials to a vast amount have been collected; and at the Old Point some progress has been made in the construction of the fortification, which is on a very extensive scale. The work at Fort Washington, on this river, will be completed early in the next spring, and that on the Pea Patch, in the Delaware, in the course of the next season. Fort Diamond, at the Narrows, in the harbor of NY, will be finished this year. The works at Boston, NY, Baltimore, Norfolk, Charleston, and Niagara have been in part repaired, and the coast of NC, extending south to Cape Fear, has been examined, as have likewise other parts of the coast eastward of Boston. 
Great exertions have been made to push forward these works with the utmost dispatch possible; but when their extent is considered, with the important purposes for which they are intended - the defense of the whole coast, and, in consequence, of the whole interior - and that they are to last for ages, it will be manifest that a well- digested plan, founded on military principles, connecting the whole together, combining security with economy, could not be prepared without repeated examinations of the most exposed and difficult parts, and that it would also take considerable time to collect the materials at the several points where they would be required. 
From all the light that has been shed on this subject I am satisfied that every favorable anticipation which has been formed of this great undertaking will be verified, and that when completed it will afford very great if not complete protection to our Atlantic frontier in the event of another war - protection sufficient to counterbalance in a single campaign with an enemy powerful at sea the expense of all these works, without taking into the estimate the saving of the lives of so many of our citizens, the protection of our towns and other property, or the tendency of such works to prevent war.
Our military positions have been maintained at Belle Point, on the Arkansas, at Council Bluffs, on the Missouri, at St. Peters, on the Mississippi, and at Green Bay, on the upper Lakes. Commodious barracks have already been erected at most of these posts, with such works as were necessary for their defense. Progress has also been made in opening communications between them and in raising supplies at each for the support of the troops by their own labor, particularly those most remote. 
With the Indians peace has been preserved and a progress made in carrying into effect the act of Congress making an appropriation for their civilization, with the prospect of favorable results. As connected equally with both these objects, our trade with those tribes is thought to merit the attention of Congress. 
In their original state game is their sustenance and war their occupation, and if they find no employment from civilized powers they destroy each other. Left to themselves their extirpation is inevitable. 
By a judicious regulation of our trade with them we supply their wants, administer to their comforts, and gradually, as the game retires, draw them to us. By maintaining posts far in the interior we acquire a more thorough and direct control over them, without which it is confidently believed that a complete change in their manners can never be accomplished. By such posts, aided by a proper regulation of our trade with them and a judicious civil administration over them, to be provided for by law, we shall, it is presumed, be enabled not only to protect our own settlements from their savage incursions and preserve peace among the several tribes, but accomplish also the great purpose of their civilization. 
Considerable progress has also been made in the construction of ships of war, some of which have been launched in the course of the present year. 
Our peace with the powers on the coast of Barbary has been preserved, but we owe it altogether to the presence of our squadron in the Mediterranean. It has been found equally necessary to employ some of our vessels for the protection of our commerce in the Indian Sea, the Pacific, and along the Atlantic coast. The interests which we have depending in those quarters, which have been much improved of late, are of great extent and of high importance to the nation as well as to the parties concerned, and would undoubtedly suffer if such protection was not extended to them. In execution of the law of the last session for the suppression of the slave trade some of our public ships have also been employed on the coast of Africa, where several captures have already been made of vessels engaged in that disgraceful traffic. 
",Fourth Annual Message,http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?nor-portfolio=corpus-of-presidential-speeches-cops-and-a-clintontrump-corpus
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-09-26,"Well, thank you very much. It's great to be with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, and his representatives. Obviously, we have much to discuss. The Prime Minister was just thanking me again for what we did in Jerusalem, with respect to the embassy. That's been something that, I guess, was controversial, but it's turned out to be very positive in many ways. And a lot of progress is being made in many other areas. We're talking trade. We're talking military. We're talking defense. And we are very much in favor of what Israel is doing as far as their defense is concerned. They're aggressive, and they have no choice but to be aggressive. It's a very difficult part of the world. So I just want to let Benjamin, let all of the people know -- let Bibi know -- that we are with you. We are with Israel 100 percent. Thank you, Bibi. Thank you.
Excuse me.
That's right.
We're working along on that. It's, I think, moving very well. There's nothing I would rather do than see peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I think lots of good things are happening. It will take a little time, as you know. It's taken plenty of time -- many, many decades, and nothing's happened. But a lot of good things are happening. Actually, by taking off the table the embassy moving to Jerusalem, that was always the primary ingredient as to why deals couldn't get done. I spoke to many of the negotiating teams, and they said they could never get past the embassy moving into Jerusalem and all of what that meant, which you know what that meant. That meant everything. And now, that's off the table. Now, that will also mean that Israel will have to do something that will be good for the other side. We’re working --
We’re working on -- we're working on deals. I think that -- I really believe something will happen. They say it's the toughest of all deals. When they talk about tough deals, they always say Israel and the Palestinians. That's the toughest of all deals. It is a dream of mine to be able to get that done prior to the end of my first term. I don't want to do it in my second term; we'll do other things in my second term. But during this period of time. And I can I say that I think a lot of progress has been made. I think that Israel wants to do something and I think that the Palestinians actually want to do something. A lot of progress has been made. So, the time is moving and that will move. And I think it will start moving pretty soon, pretty rapidly. Thank you.
Say it? Say it?
I will talk if it’s appropriate, when it’s appropriate. Yes, I will do that.
Well, that's a big chip that they got. I took probably the biggest chip off the table, and so obviously we have to start -- you know, we have to make a fair deal. We have to do something. Deals have to be good for both parties. Otherwise, you don't have a deal and you don’t have a lasting deal. So something will have to be done. But that’s a very big chip. Israel got the first chip and it’s a big one. There’s no question about it.
Well, I haven’t heard this. We were just discussing it two minutes ago, and we’ll make a determination. We’ll find out about that.
Absolutely. One-hundred percent. As you know, we were paying them $550 million a year. Now, we’re paying them nothing a year. Because we were -- for years and years, we were being abused by the leadership of the Palestinians and giving them all of this money. So, now we’re not. But that will start up again and it’ll start up -- I look forward to it because they use it for some purposes that are good -- and some purposes that are not good, and not acceptable. So, yeah, they’re absolutely coming back to the table. And they want to come back to the table.
I like two-state solution. I like two-state solution.
You just heard me, right? Okay, so that’s enough questions from you. Is that all right.
Say it?
I like two-state solution. Yeah. That’s -- that what I think -- that’s what I think works best. I don’t even have to speak to anybody, that’s my feeling. Now, you may have a different feeling -- I don’t think so -- but I think two-state solution works best. Yes, go ahead.
I think the Europeans will behave very nicely. Very nicely. Just watch.
No, I’m not upset by anything. I don’t get upset.
Okay, yes please, Steve?
We’ll have something -- we have something very much in mind. It’s moving along really well. I want to have -- I want to have a plan, Steve, that is solid, understood by both sides -- really, semi-agreed to by both sides before we start a negotiation. I would say over the next two to three to four months, something like that.
That would be the time that I’d like to at least release the plan. It is a very complex situation, but I think we have some brilliant ideas. Ideas that have never been thought of before. Ideas that are good for both parties. And again, it has to be good for both parties. Okay? Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Bilat Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-bilat-netanyahu-israel-september-26-2018
Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2016-09-15,"Hello! Hello, CHCI! It is so great to be back here with so many friends and to see so many young people here because that fits the theme this year: educate, engage, vote. And I can't think of better marching orders for the next 54 days. This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.
I want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders. Last year, I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows. It really was like seeing the future of America in one room. I can't wait to see everything that they achieve. And I can't wait, if I'm fortunate enough to be president, to put some of them to work!
And I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community – when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off, at home in your districts and here in Washington. And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment we're at right now – not just for Latinos but for our country.
My friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state, registered voters. You've stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters. By the way, I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious.
I, for one, don't think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression. Think of what we've achieved these last eight years. American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession. Twenty million Americans have health coverage – and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans. We got more good news this week. A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all.
Now, that doesn't mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch. Our work is far from finished. But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it's big enough for everyone to share its promise. That doesn't mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are. And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it's easy to get discouraged. But we're here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America's future.
Either we're going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top.
Either we're going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity.
Either we're going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we're going to be stronger together.
Today, as you know, we're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month. In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Julián and Joaquín Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others – names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations.
. You're not intruders. You're our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative. And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again – time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits.
As I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election. And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. It will be the passion of my presidency. So tonight I want to mention two things I'll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America.
First, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth. We've got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids. So we're going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy.
And we're going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere. And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners. Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America. And we're going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today. Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. When families are strong, America is strong.
And that brings me to another important family issue. In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress. My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship. Now, I know this isn't the first time you've heard it. In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade. But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on. I've been called a lot of things; I've never been called a quitter.
And in this election – in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just the smart thing to do, it's what the American people demand. And you know how we'll show that? Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January.
And while we're fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we're going to keep families together. When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families. But the court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. And as I've said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President's authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them.
But in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there's more we can do. We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too. Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses. And we won't stop there. We're going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups. No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.
So here's the bottom line. Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it's always been – a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.
Now, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn't be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn't be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others. They helped change the conversation. And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives.
Right now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future. They're DREAMers in much more than name. I've met so many. I've listened to their stories. They've done everything we've asked of them and made our country stronger in return.
So when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.
I picture Astrid Silva – who I met in Las Vegas. Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere.
I picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story. His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic. He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army. Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.
He was, his teacher wrote, 'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.' He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child. He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship. But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was just 19. The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he'd always wanted.
All these years later – his teacher still treasures his memory. And this teacher wanted me to know – he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals. The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.
We teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all. Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they've heard from my opponent – from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge.
And every time we think he's hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower. His latest target? A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks. He called her a nervous mess.
How insulting, how dead wrong. Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess – she's a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America. And again today, he did it again. He was asked one more time, 'Where was President Obama born?' And he still wouldn't still say 'Hawaii.' He still wouldn't say 'America.' This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?
Now, he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is. And so we need to decide who we are. If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear. We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren
Parents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the 'Trump Effect.' Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.
At a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of 'Build the wall' and 'Speak English.'
Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes. His message is you should be afraid – afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country. There's no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It's all right out there in the open now. So we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.
Just this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco. He's proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican. As he calls it, a 'potluck' of Hispanic heritage. And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me. He wears his 'Love Trumps Hate' pin every day and refuses to take it off. When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: 'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in. And I believe Trump is wrong.' And good for you, Francisco.
That's what we have to do in this election, and that's what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from.
Together, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.
We've set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can't do it without you. Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election.
So we're going to keep asking for your help. Keep hitting the campaign trail. Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community – everyone you see between now and November 8th. Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved. This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez.
So let's stand up for a future where we put families first. Where we build bridges, not walls.
And yes, together we can prove love trumps hate. Thank you all very much.""
","Remarks to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington, D.C.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-congressional-hispanic-caucus-institute-washington-dc
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-04-19,"Thank you very much. I’d like to begin by saying that we’re continuing to negotiate with the Democrats to get our great workers and small businesses all over the country taken care of. I think we’re getting close to a deal. Could happen, could happen. A lot of good work has been going on and we could have an answer tomorrow and we’re going to see what exactly does take place. We’re also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals who have been hurt very badly. The rural hospitals for a long time have not been treated properly. We’re looking to help them and beyond, so we’re looking at hospitals also as part of the package and we’ll see how that all comes out. But a lot of good things are happening. Some very good negotiations. Just got off the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury and we have some very good negotiations going on right now, and I think you could have a nice answer tomorrow, but we’ll see.
America continues to make steady progress in our war against the virus. As of today, we’ve tested 4.18 million Americans. That’s a record anywhere in the world. The United States has now conducted more total tests than all of the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada. And our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people. So we’ve done more testing than all of these countries combined. France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria and Australia, Sweden and Canada. That’s something, right? We’re doing a great job. We are, this team is an incredible team and that includes Army Corps of Engineers a lot of our military people, our admirals, our generals, got one of our great admirals here, has done an incredible job. You haven’t slept too much in the last two months either. Look at him. Somebody said to me, “President, you look tired.” I said, “I should be tired.”
We should all be tired, but we have to win, right?
Tomorrow the president, the vice president, will lead a call with our nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters, Mike?
To review what more they could do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies, working very hard with governors now on testing and want to help them out. Before the call, we’ll send them a full list of all of the large laboratory machines in the states. They have a lot of machinery in the states, that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there and they’re really high quality machines, by the way. And the potential capacity of those machines, if they’re fully utilized, a couple of them didn’t know that they could be utilized in a different manner. They were only up to 10% and they can go 90% more. Many governors are still relying on their state laboratories rather than the full and much larger capacity that is available to them.
As an example, commercial laboratories such as Quest and LabCorp, these are massive laboratories that can handle a lot more than they’re being sent. A few days ago, it was at 30%. They were only at 30% capacity. Now, I don’t know, they’re probably the same, but they have a lot of capacity. In addition, academic laboratories, big research labs. There’s tremendous capacity out there and some of them want the fast, the instant Abbott machine, which just came about due to the research during this little short period of time and it’s very quick. But these labs can do it very quickly also, and they’re massive. They can handle much more than the machine, the small machine can handle. We continue to procure millions of swabs, test collectors. I have something here, just happen to have, it’s a swab. It looks innocent. Not very complicated. Anybody like to see what it looks like. Should I open it? Does everybody?
Open it up. I will. This is what it’s about, right? Does it remind you of something? it Reminds you of this, right? One’s a swab, one’s a Q-tip. It’s actually different. It’s very sophisticated actually, but it’s a little bit like, so this is the swab, and we’ve ordered a lot of them. They have a lot of them, some of them, some of the states, they were shipped to states and the states don’t know where they are, but that’s it. Why don’t we give this to Karen? Perhaps she’ll take an extra test. Right? But this is a big deal and we’re working on it and we’re working with the companies and I think in the end we’re going to have a tremendous success. Nobody is close to us. No country is close to us.
In fact, and I appreciate it very much, the Wall Street Journal wrote a fantastic piece, a highly respected gentleman, Christopher DeMuth, and this piece was just in the Wall Street Journal, weekend edition. “Trump rewrites the book on emergencies.” That’s what’s happened, too. And we, just read one paragraph. “He’s given pride of place to federalism and private enterprise, lauding the patriotism and proficiency of our fantastic governors and mayors,” meaning I do call them fantastic when it’s appropriate, “and our incredible business leaders and genius companies,” I guess I probably use those terms too, when they’re doing a good job. When they’re not doing a good job, I don’t use those terms. “Our heroic doctors and nurses and orderlies and our tremendous truckers.” They have all done good jobs. “By shouting out many of them by name and documenting their deeds on a fully daily basis, he has vivified the American way in action. Once it was reluctantly aroused,” it was hard to get it aroused, and it is hard to get it aroused, but we got it aroused. “When asked why he has not issued orders for nationwide home and business lockdowns, he has emphasized that the intensity of the epidemic varies widely and is best met by calibrated state and local judgments.” That’s the judgments of governors and local people. “And added pointedly that such steps would conflict with the Constitution.”
But very importantly, he’s just a very respected gentleman. To see this was a very nice feeling. Not for me necessarily, but for all of the people that have worked with us. I mean, they’ve worked so hard and we’ve developed tests that are so fantastic. We’ve come up with things that nobody had ever heard of and we did it during this pandemic. We did it under pressure. It’s called reaction under pressure. It’s pretty amazing what our people have done and that includes all of our military people and our CDC, just about everybody you can imagine, including Tony and Deborah, and they’ve worked long hours.
There’s nobody that’s getting a lot of sleep. We’re close to finalizing, I want to thank the writer Christopher, for this article, and it’s a great article. That was frankly, at least of it what I read, it was a great article. We appreciate it. We’re close to finalizing a second partnership through which a U.S. manufacturer would convert its existing plant to produce over 10 million additional swabs for a month and we should be ready to announce this in a very short period of time. We also are going to be using, and we’re preparing to use the Defense Production Act to increase swab production in one U.S. facility by over 20 million additional swabs per month. We’ve had a little difficulty with one, so we’re going to call in, as we have in the past, as you know, we’re calling in the Defense Production Act and we’ll be getting swabs very easily. Swabs are easy. Ventilators are hard. Ventilators are a big deal and we are now the king of ventilators. We have so many ventilators. I said nobody that needed a ventilator has been turned down. It’s pretty amazing. Nobody.
We’re working with the world-class team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to use its injection molding capacity to potentially produce over 10 million collection tubes per week. That’s tremendous numbers. In the meantime, the supply chain and logistics task force continues to surge testing and needed supplies all throughout America. Mike’s team and the task force, they just met. They’ve been meeting virtually every day and it’s a great team, right? It’s a great team. They’ve been doing a great job, mike. You’ve been doing a great job. Many governors are doing this incredible work and they’re working with us very closely on testing and working in their states. And again, it should be a local thing because it’s point, it’s all these points within a state, but we’re helping them a lot and we want to help them a lot. We’re going to help them more than a lot, actually, if you think about it, with what we’ve done.
Think of it. We’ve done more than all those countries combined. We’re encouraging them to share their successful strategies with other governors. Some of the governors are doing a better job than others. The robust capacity that we’ve brought online will empower governors to deploy sophisticated strategies so they can safely reopen their states. Some people believe in testing very strongly and other people believe in it less strongly, but still it’s a very good thing to have. I think we can say that. Some people believe in it like they can’t exist without testing and other people don’t believe in it nearly as much. They can see how they’re doing and they feel how they’re doing and they’ve been pretty vocal about that. I think you know pretty much who I’m talking about, but I believe if they want it, we should give it to them and get it for them and work with them.
You must remember that the governors wanted to have total control over the opening of their states, but now they want to have us, the federal government, do the testing. And again, testing is local. You can’t have it both ways. Testing is a local thing and it’s very important. It’s great, but it’s a local thing and we’re going to get it done to a level in a very short period of time because all of these, all of the swabs are coming in. All of the necessarily materials. A lot of them, as I said, are already there, but a lot of people don’t know that yet. But we’ll be doing testing at a level, already we’re doing testing at a level nobody’s ever done before, but we’ll be doing testing at a level that the biggest tester in the world would be very happy, very soon.
And it is, it’s very much like ventilators. You don’t hear the word mentioned and that’s much tougher, much tougher when you have to build these machines. We built thousands of machines. We’ll more than help the governors and we’ll make sure that everything goes well just like it did with ventilators, just frankly like it did with face masks on a much easier subject as face masks. Again, everything’s easier than a ventilator. Ventilators are tough. But now I spoke yesterday with the president of Mexico and with various other countries. We’re going to be helping them with ventilators. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators. In fact, I hear, I understand that Governor Cuomo is going to be sending up to Massachusetts some of the excess ventilators that we were able to get and that’s great. I think that’s a great thing.
The number of new hospital admissions is also significantly down. When you look at these numbers, it’s a good thing to see other than the fact that we also know how people have been just ravaged by this curse, by this horrible scourge, plague, call it. It’s got many different names. In many of the hotspots, including a 50% decline over a nine day period in New York city. That’s a fantastic decline. It’s a beautiful thing to see after going through the opposite. We continue to see improvement with declining trajectory of cases in Seattle, Detroit, New Orleans, Indianapolis, and Houston metro areas, more evidence that our aggressive strategy is working. And I think the American people for their selfless devotion, the American people have done a hell of a job. We’re saving countless lives though, and again, I’ll say it, because I always wanted to say, “well, can you leave it open?” Nobody ever heard of anything like this.
Not since 1917, more than a hundred years ago, has anything like this happened. And in those days they had no real communication. So you couldn’t say, “go inside, don’t,” people just died. Almost a hundred million people, it’s reported. It’s tough, so the American people, what they’ve done is incredible. And they’ve learned a lot. You see people picketing a little bit and they want to get out. They want to get out and get back with their lives and that’s good. But they have learned a lot. They’ve learned about distancing even now, at least until this thing totally goes away. They’ve learned about their washing their hands and all of the different things that we’ve been talking about ad nauseum for so long. And they get it. They get it. In some places the governors are ready to go and other places they can’t go yet and they won’t go. They want to, they have to have it safe.
I want it to be safe too. It has to be safe. And again, I have to say this, I can’t emphasize it strongly enough. I’m probably going to show you charts of some of the countries that are really having trouble. And one in particular is having a massive problem where they said, “let’s go. We’re just going to keep going.” Well, they’re the lines that we’re famous for now. Some are flat and some are up. This is like a rocket ship, this country is. And they didn’t, they decided let’s go and let’s wing it. That’s, they thought it was okay, but it’s a problem. It’s a big problem. And there’s another couple. There’s one in particular that everybody thinks did it, but the people are staying in. Okay? The head of a country doesn’t have to say stay in. These people are smart people. They know what’s going on. They see what’s going on. So they don’t have to say, they can say they’re not doing that, but the people who are staying inside, there are not a lot of people outside sitting at cafes despite what the mode of a country is.
But if you look at Europe, most countries have done this. A couple tried not to. Italy tried not to, and they held it and Spain tried not to. They went that way. France tried not to. I mean, nobody wants to do this. It’s a brutal step. We’re going to close down your country, whoever heard of a thing like this? But we would have had millions of people die if we didn’t do this. Millions of people. And I believe that Mike. I think in looking at things that we’ve been looking at over the last couple of days, I think, and really over the last couple of weeks, from the time we did it, shortly thereafter, I said we made the right decision in closing down, made the right decision on borders, banning people coming in from China, banning ultimately people coming in from Europe.
But we would have had millions of deaths instead of, it looks like we’ll be at about a 60,000 mark, which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of. So this isn’t a case where people would say, “oh, we would’ve had that number. It’s similar to a flu.” It’s not the same thing as a flu at all. Because if we wouldn’t have done anything, you would’ve had, so a flu would have 35 and it goes from 27 to 35, 40, 50 sometimes. It’s over a long period of time, much different. It’s even a much different death, to be honest. It’s a much different death. This is violent.
CMS is finalizing new guidelines for doctors and patients to resume elective surgeries. It’s a big thing. A lot of hospitals were closed. They couldn’t do any elective surgeries. They’ll be able to start doing that. Procedures and medical care that needs to be done in person. As long as the rate of infections remains low in a community, we want patients to be able to go to their doctors, get clinically tested, have work done, surgeries, receive treatment for chronic conditions and resume preventative care. So we’ll be allowing that to happen very soon. We had no capacity in the hospitals with what happened with the plague. We had no capacity to do it. If your doctor believes you need a treatment in person, you can get a treatment now. You can and should get a treatment now. We are asking that healthcare facilities have plans in place to keep patients safe during their visit. Some places like New York, New Jersey, where they really got hit hard, it’s going to be a little bit tougher. They’ve done a great job, but they really were a center. I mean they were a center. I was watching that. It was incredible.
But now they’re leveling off and I think they’ll be coming down very soon. Administrator Seema Verma will be telling you a little bit more about it. Mike’s going to say a few words. Seema will then speak, tell you a little bit more about that. My administration continues to execute our massive military operation to supply our hospitals with equipment they need and beds if necessary, but it looks like we’re totally covered on beds. We have plenty of beds. It’s highly unlikely. That would be bad news if we needed more beds, but it looks like it’s going just the opposite direction. I want to thank Governor Cuomo, the relationship there for this whole thing, where building hospitals was very good. We built a little bit more than we needed, and that’s good as opposed to building a little bit less. That’s not good, but he’s worked very well with us.
The governor of Louisiana has been great on the bed, on that whole situation with the beds. Frankly, the governor of Michigan was very good with us on beds. It’s a very complex subject. You need buildings or you have to do tents or you have to do a lot of different things, a lot of different ways, but the Army Corps of Engineers was fantastic. They were fantastic. Florida, likewise. Governor DeSantis, and I could name probably six other locations. I’ll tell you one, California was fantastic. He was really good. He was really good and I appreciate the fact that he said what he wanted to say and he wasn’t letting the press force him into saying something that he didn’t want to say, so I appreciate it very much. Governor of California, he really worked very hard. We work together. We worked very hard.
The federal government is currently procuring more than 100,000 ventilators through new production or purchases with thousands already delivered. We’ve delivered thousands of brand new ventilators, all throughout the country. New York would be, I guess, the biggest user, and they are now taking some of their excess ventilators, which is great, and they’re sending them up to Massachusetts. I think it’s 400. And that’s a great thing. Our total supply of ventilators continues to exceed, by a lot, total expected demand. Governor Cuomo said today that no one who needed a ventilator was denied a ventilator. That’s a beautiful statement and I appreciate it and all governors are in that same position. We do have a clip that I thought would be appropriate to put up today. It’ll take two minutes and I think you’ll find it interesting, but we appreciate it and let’s see if we can do that. You’ll turn out the lights and we’ll see if we can do that. Thank you.
He’s a good looking guy.
We actually had something else. Are they finished with it? They left out the good part. Great, great job, fellas. They did a better job with ventilators. No, Andrew had something else to say that was really nice, but we won’t go through that. I mean, it was really a good statement. You want to put the rest of it up or do you not have it? I just think it’s so good because it’s bipartisan. This is not about Democrats, Republicans, this is about a thing that hit our country, the likes of which has never happened to us before. Wars, those wars, Civil War, sure. The First World War, the Second World War, they’re not fought on this country. This is being fought in this country, but it’s being fought in 184 countries all over the world. It’s terrible. But I want to thank Andrew, Governor Cuomo for the statement. He actually, if you go a little bit further, it was even a far beyond even that. Huh?
Well that’s okay, whatever. He said some really good things and it makes people feel good. Actually, the Wall Street Journal, Christopher was saying, I want to make people feel good too. When they’re doing a good job, I want to make people feel good. I want the Admiral to feel good, he’s worked so hard. Mike has worked so hard. And it was very nice. It was on this morning, it was Andrew this morning. So it’s a little longer clip than that, but you’ll see, it was really a very nice thing that he said and people really appreciate that because they’ve done a great job. The federal government’s done a great job. I mean, with all of it, and this is easy. The swabs are, that’s easy. We have them coming by the tens of millions. We have them coming at a level that you’ll have so many swabs, you won’t know what to do with them. That’s easy.
So they’ll all be there, a lot of them are there already. They’re learning about their testing capacity that they didn’t know about that we have in the various labs. Including academic, they have to remember, you have a lot of these big colleges that have labs that are totally ready to help. But I want to thank The Dynamic Ventilator Reserve because what they’ve done is incredible. That’s a capital DVR by the way, an innovative public private partnership, that’s what we created. We’re gaining access to up to 65,000 additional ventilators in hospitals across the nation that can be redeployed very quickly to areas with the greatest need when they’re not in use and we right now have almost 10,000 in our reserve.
We’ve been able to give away thousands, like we helped Andrew or we helped Phil in New Jersey, he’s doing a great job. Andrew would tell you that too. They have a very good relationship working together and working with us. Now we’re back up to almost 10,000 and this is after giving away tens of thousands of ventilators. And we’re going to fill up the reserves of states, we’re going to work with them so in case this happens again. But we’re also going to help other countries. I was telling you, the president of Mexico, we’re going to be sending a pretty large quantity to Mexico. They very much need them and to other countries where they need them. I’ve had about six calls with leaders of other countries and they need them. They’re hard to get done, we did. Our companies stepped up and they did an incredible job.
Some of them were automobile companies and they’d take an assembly line and they said, “Guess what? We’re making ventilators now for awhile.” But because of this historic steps that we’ve taken, I remain confident that every American who needs any of this equipment, any of the things we’re talking about, we’ll either have it now, already has it or will shortly have it. Through the Project Air Bridge, we’ve completed 64 flights carrying over 600 million pieces of personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, and other medical gear with 50 more flights scheduled in the very near future. The team doing that is an incredible team of military people and young geniuses. Some are older geniuses, but mostly younger geniuses, I think I can say. Some are people that made vast amounts of money in Silicon Valley, these are very smart people. The job they’ve done is incredible.
And I said, “Where do you come from? Well, I sold my company, sir. Oh really, how much did you get?” I think he said $700 million. I said, “That’s good. You want to work for the government? No, I want to help our country, sir.” And it’s tremendous brain power, it’s a beautiful thing to see. Young, incredible people that love this country, and they worked with a military. Admiral, you would say they were pretty smart, right?
They’re in the upper scales of IQ. They were the upper, they were the top scale, I’ll tell you, and they’re great people. But FEMA’s working to commit another $384 million to produce another 64 million gowns for healthcare. These are the highest quality where they’re very safe. When you put them on, they’re safe. Very important, the quality of the gown is very important. It’s people in different places, different countries that wearing gowns with cuts in them and these are very safe. We want to thank America’s textile manufacturers for their partnership in this remarkable undertaking. Two U.S. companies, Hanes and Standard Textile are on track to produce five million gowns by the end of the month and that’s really moving. That’s really moving. Two great companies, you know the companies. Another great American company, Honeywell, recently began manufacturing N95 masks in Rhode Island, where they converted a factory in less than five weeks instead of the nine months it was normally expected to take. So they’ve already done it and they did it so rapidly. Five weeks instead of nine months.
It’s amazing the spirit of this country, it’s really about the spirit of the country. We said do it, do it fast, but they did it in a… and this was a major conversion too, this is a different world. Honeywell is hiring more than 1,000 American workers to produce 20 million masks per month. 20 million masks a month. Thanks to the Defense Production Act we’ll be receiving another 40 million masks over the next few weeks. And I also want to thank 3M because they really stepped up. We had a little dispute at the beginning but that got worked out quickly and they’ve been doing a great job. 3M, they really have been, I want to thank their great CEO. We had a little skirmish but it worked out well. And they’re doing a lot of work right now on masks and other things. This production is in addition to the 55 million N95 masks my administration has already distributed. Plus we ordered, and it’s coming in soon, 500 million masks.
You would think, what are you going to do with them? They get used rapidly. In addition to that, as you know, we sterilize masks now, great company in Ohio, recommended by the governor of Ohio strongly. And it’s doing very well and they’re sterilizing, a lot of the mass can be sterilized up to 20 times. So that’s like buying 20 masks. And I always wondered why aren’t they sterilizing these masks? Some of them are pretty sophisticated masks. And some you can’t, because of the material, others you can, but we have actually two companies that do this, but one company I know very well in Ohio and they’re doing a great job. So they’re sterilizing masks up to 20 times, you can sterilize a certain type of mask. To these numbers in perspective and to put them into perspective, American healthcare providers use an estimated 25 million N95 masks nationwide in a typical year, so a typical year, 25 million.
That means we’ve secured nearly four times as many N95 masks in recent weeks as we would an entire healthcare industry during a typical year. Over a matter of couple of weeks we had more masks than we would do in a year. Think of that, over a couple of weeks. Moreover, we’re bringing supply chains back home and we’ve learned a lot about supply chains. We’ve learned that it’s nice to make things in the U.S. I’ve been saying that for a long time. One of the reasons I ran for office, because we started making things everywhere but here. And if one thing comes out of this more than anything else, is that we should make product in the United States. And these supply chains, they sound wonderful, but if one country has a problem, the whole chain is ruined and I’ve been saying it for a long time. I ran partially on that. I ran partially on that. I ran on that and I ran very strongly against China. And then we made a great trade deal, where they buy $250 billion, they’re supposed to.
And they’re paying tariffs, they paid us tens of billions of dollars. I’ve given 12 billion one year, 16 billion another year, 19 billion to our farmers and ranchers who were targeted. But I ran on China and other countries, the way they were ripping us off, they were ripping off our country. And China understood that, I mean, China fully understood that and they’re big, strong, smart people and I wasn’t friendly and it wasn’t a friendly situation. And we ended up making an incredible deal with China for tens of billions of dollars of product, 40 to $50 billion to the farmers. The most they ever spent was 15 to 16, now they’re supposed to spend 40 to 50. Now of course the virus came along and I’m not happy, I’m not happy. I let them know I’m not happy. So we had a great relationship with… we had a very bad relationship with China. Then we had a good relationship because we made a great deal, but we’re not happy.
This is not a good thing that happened, came out of China, so we’re not in a position where we’re going to say much yet, but the deal itself is great. The deal is, it’s going to put many, many people to work in our country. But all of that has to be taken into account when you look at all of the people that are dying in our country, but all over the world, all over the world people are dying. I had a G-7 call and their economies are in tatters. They’re shattered, the G-7 countries. You have Japan and Germany and France, the different countries, Italy, look at what happened to Italy. Look at what happened to these countries. Look at what happened to Spain. Look what happened to Spain, how incredible, it’s just been shattered and so many other countries are shattered. So nobody ever thought this could have happened, a thing like this, it’s very, very sad.
But if we’ve learned something, it’s about supply chains. I just saw yesterday, where when the auto industry gets back, they have a problem because there’s a supply chain going through a different country. And this has been going on for years, for decades. I always said it was no good. Why do you need a supply chain? Very simple, make your parts here. They get one part from this country, one part from that country. It’s all over the place. The problem is if one country has a problem, you have no car or whatever it is you’re making. So we’ve learned a good lesson. I think a lot of smart people knew that before, but we’ve distributed many hundreds of millions of masks. This pandemic has underscored the vital importance of reshoring our supply chains and bringing them back into the United States where they belong, where they should have never left. What happens if you’re in a war and you have a supply chain where half of your supplies are given to you by other countries? Who are the people that thought of this? These are globalists. It doesn’t work.
It certainly doesn’t work during rough times, bad times or dangerous times. So we’re going to continue to fight the virus. We’re talking to China, we spoke to them a long time ago about going in, we want to go in, we want to see what’s going on and we weren’t exactly invited, I can tell you that. If you look at some of the investigations that are going on, in terms of World Health Organization and I’ll take it a step further, World Trade Organization too, World Trade. We did years ago, years ago, many years ago, the World Trade Organization, from the day China came in, that’s when China bloomed. They were mainlining it and then boom, they were up like a rocket ship because they took advantage of every little ridiculous clause in the World Trade Organization documents. They were developing nation, China was a developing nation.
They make the cars, they make the plant, they make everything, they make everything and they’re a developing nation. I might’ve gotten elected to a certain extent because of China and other countries. One of my big things was trade, the United States is getting ripped off in trade. Now Japan is paying $40 billion and buying a lot. That’s before we even do the deal. U.S., Mexico was a great deal. The NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made in trade history. And I would also put the World Trade Organization in that same group. So I was very tough on these countries. With China, we made the deal and we became friendly. But then this happened and this is tantamount, this is something that’s really incredible. I do want to read something that I just saw today on television. I was looking and I just said, that’s an interesting statement. We talk about the Democrats and it was a statement made by Brett Baier, good guy, smart. On February 19th, there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas. That was February 19th, that’s way after I closed entrance from China into our country.
So Brett goes, “On February 19th there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas. Three words weren’t said during the debate, virus, coronavirus or COVID-19, those three words never came up.” I just thought it was a very interesting, because you hear these people, some of the people, the Democrats said, oh, this that. It never even was a part of their dialogue. Now they bring it up because you see what happens now, but they didn’t bring it out. But I brought it up. I brought it up a long time before I made the trade deal and I was not easy to deal with. I was not easy to deal with. They understand that. We still have 25% of $250 billion that they have to pay us and it’s a lot of money. We’re taking in a lot of money and we’ve had a lot of beneficiaries, including our farmers and ranches.
So in addition, we’ve launched an unprecedented effort to develop new treatments and therapies to battle the plague. Therapies to me are the most exciting, the vaccines are obviously so important, but the therapies are immediate. And we have some things that are really looking good, really looking good. We call COVID Treatment Acceleration Program. We’re accelerating all of these great companies that are looking, and we have government agencies looking too, N.I.H. This extraordinary program is slashing red tape to speed and development and to rival and if you look at what we’re doing in terms of the speed, it’s unrivaled, it’s totally unrivaled. There’s never been anything like it. The FDA and Dr. Stephen Hahn, a highly respected man from a great institution, left that job to come here.
The job he’s doing is incredible and we’re working with Scott, his predecessor, is terrific. We’re working with a lot of people. But the speed of development for antiviral, antibody and immune therapies is at a level that nobody thought even possible. And I will say this, we’re getting very good results. It’s a little soon yet. But if we could find the therapies that would solve the problem, if somebody has a problem, we can get it taken care of so it’s not so devastating as it has been. With that, I’m going to ask Vice President Pence to come up and I have to say it’s a Sunday, Sunday evening and this man has not stopped. He’s working, we all are in all fairness, but he’s been working with this task force and everyone else round the clock for months and I just want to thank Mike. Thank you, Mike.
Thank you, Mike. Very good. Seema, you’ve done such a great job. Please come up and say a couple of words. Thank you.
Thank you very much. And Dr. Hahn is here. If you need to, he’ll tell you maybe a little bit later if you want this, but I can tell you that very simply, the level at which they’re approving things, tests, and being on top of the people that are doing the testing for therapies and for vaccines, they’ve never seen anything like this. So I want to thank you very much. And stick around. Maybe they’ll have some questions, okay? Please go ahead, in the back.
Against the shutdown?
People feel that way. You’re allowed to protest. I mean, they feel that way. I watched the protest, and they were all six feet apart. I bet it was a very orderly group of people, but some have gone too far. Some governors have gone too far. Some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate, and I think in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re starting to open up our states. And I think they’re going to open up very well. We’re going to be watching it. We’re going to be watching it very closely. We’re working with them on testing. We’re working with them on whatever they need. I don’t think they need ventilators anymore. I believe the term the governor used was phenomenal. We’ve done a phenomenal job. That was the only sentence they left out, which is okay, but I appreciate that that’s what Governor Cuomo said. These people have done a phenomenal job. As far as protesters, I see protestors for all sorts of things, and I’m with everybody. I’m with everybody. Please in the back, go ahead. In the back, go ahead. You ready? Yeah.
If Iran needed aid on this, I would be willing to do something if they want it. If they ask for it, I would be certainly willing. They were hit very hard. Obviously, those numbers weren’t correct numbers that they reported, but if they needed help, if they needed aid, if they needed ventilators, we have thousands of ventilators currently on hand and ventilators that are under construction. That’s a mosquito. I don’t like mosquitoes. I don’t like mosquitoes at all, but yeah, we would certainly be willing to help. What they should do is be smart and make a deal. It’s only because of you look at what happened, John Kerry I guess just doesn’t want them to make a deal. And they’re probably figuring they could wait, and maybe it will be Biden, and they’ll own America if Biden gets… And they know with me doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t work that way. If Joe Biden got in, they’d own America. Between them, China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, they’d own America. You wouldn’t have a country left if he got in. Go ahead, please.
I don’t want to mention names specifically, but obviously, one we can mention that’s this, but really much beyond this is Virginia with what they’ve done on guns. He is playing with your second amendment. We can’t allow that to happen. And that is indirectly related to this because you know what’s happened with guns. People are buying guns at a level that you haven’t seen before because of this surge of plague. So what he did was totally inappropriate. Other than that, I’m not going to mention governors, but I have a list, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Well, I hope so.
I don’t know. Whatever it is, yeah.
Every time you say it’s ready to go, then they say, “Oh, we have a good negotiating position now because he just said it’s ready to go.” So now let’s see what happens, but we want to take care of our workers. We want to take care of our small businesses. They’re really the engine of this country. When we open, we want to have those small businesses ready to go. We don’t want those businesses abandoned because they couldn’t afford their employees, they couldn’t take care, and I want to take care of those employees.
I can’t tell you that. I can just tell you that we’re negotiating with the democrats, and they negotiate for things that we can’t do, that we don’t think are in the best interest of the people of this country. We are very close to a deal. I can’t tell you whether or not we’re going to get the deal or not. Who would say that? You want me to say we’re going to have a deal before we have a deal. We have a good chance of getting a deal. A lot of good discussions were had today. We have a good chance of getting the deal. We want the deal. We want to take care of our workers. We want to take care of our small companies. Go ahead, please.
Sure.
I do. No, I want it to be safe.
I want it to be safe, absolutely.
Well, if you take Michigan, there were things in Michigan that I don’t think they were necessary or appropriate. Everyone knows that. I think the governor of Michigan… We’re getting along very well, but I think the governor of Michigan probably knows that. I think she probably wished she didn’t put some of them in. You can’t buy paint. You can’t buy seeds. I mean, where did this stuff come from? No, no. We’re going to be safe. We have to be safe. We don’t want to close anything. We’re not going to be closing, but we’re going to be doing it beautifully, systematically. We’re working very well with the governors, I mean, I would say pretty much almost all of them. A couple of them, no matter what you do, you’ll never satisfy them. You could find a cure tomorrow, and they wouldn’t be satisfied. They’d find a reason to complain. Wise guys. But for the most part, we’re working very well with the governors. We have a great relationship with the governors.
I can tell you I’ve been on numerous calls with governors, and during those calls, I mean, without exception they were friendly, and that’s going back even a month from today. So I think that we’re going to do a terrific job. I think the governors are going to do a terrific job, but we’re starting to open our country. And as you know, I just spoke with Greg Abbott today from Texas. He’s fantastic. He’s a fantastic governor, and he’s going to be opening up parts of Texas. And you’re going to be opening up parts of other states. And you know what that is. And by the way, other countries are at a point where they’re starting… I see where Germany is starting to open up little sections.
So there are a lot of great things happening, and we’re going to start to open our country, and we’re going to do it. As I say, it’s like a beautiful puzzle. The state, might even be a portion of a state. There are very big states, and you can have portions of states, Mike. You have a portion. You have a county, which is perfect, and you have another county that’s sort of still pretty far away, even if it’s within the same state, and it’s not doing so well, but they may open up part. So we’re going to do it very, very carefully, and I think it’s going to be a very successful, but when you say safe, I want it to be very safe.
Let him just do this one. Go ahead, please.
Doctor.
And I think they have the rest of that clip. I just thought it was a very good clip. I think it’s a tribute to New York. I think it’s a tribute to the federal government, and I thought it was nice. So I think they have that now. They can try it. Go ahead.
Okay.
Yes, I did.
Who are you with?
Who are you with?
Who are you with?
So if you look at what I did in terms of cutting off or banning China from coming in-
Nice and easy, nice and easy. Just relax. We cut it off. People were amazed. These gentlemen, everybody was amazed that I did it. We had 21 people in a room. Everybody was against it but me. Dr. Fauci said had I not done that, perhaps tens of thousands, or maybe much more than that, people would’ve died. I was very early, very, very early. You we just saw, you saw, Brett Baier making a statement. They had a debate well into February and not even mentioned. It wasn’t even mentioned. The democrats-
I’m the president. And you know what I just did?
And you know what I just-
Okay. And you know how many people when I issued the ban, how many cases of virus were in the United States when I issued the ban? Do you know the number?
No, no. How many cases? Remember I said one person. How many cases were here when I issued the ban? Tell me.
No, no, no. You have to do your research.
Can I tell what?
I did know it. I did know it. All I have to do is look.
Well, anybody knew it. Are you ready? How many cases were in the United States when I did my ban? How many people had died in the United States.
Keep your voice down please. Keep your voice down.
How many cases were in the United States? I did a band where I’m closing up the entire country. How many people died?
How many people died in the United States? And yet I closed up the country, and I believe there were no deaths, zero deaths at the time I closed up the country. Nobody was there. And you should say thank you very much for good judgment. Go ahead please.
Yes, they are. I just spoke to them.
Well, I hope so. We hope it works out. I spoke with Angela, and they’re going to start a process of opening very much like we are. We are too. I spoke with numerous governors. They’re doing it also, areas where number one, they’ve done a good job and where they don’t have much of a problem. Germany is starting the process also, yes, and I’m very happy about that. Some places in Europe, as you know, can’t start the process for a while. Yes ma’am. Go ahead please.
Well, they shut one of my hotels down too, okay? I’m not involved in that. I could be if I wanted to. I just chose not to be. By the way, just so you know, I could be if I wanted to, but I chose not, but they closed a very big hotel that I have in Nevada down in Las Vegas. It’s a very severe step he took. I’m okay with it. I’m okay with it. But you could call that one either way. I know the mayor is very upset with it. Some owners are very upset with it. Some of the developers out there very upset. Others they say, “Hey, we got to get rid of it.” I can see both sides of that.
They are looking into it right now because they have small casinos that don’t have too many people, and they’re going to make a ruling, I understand, next week.
I know, but they are continuing to look at that. It’s a big topic.
But they’re looking at that. They’re continuing to look at that. It’s a big topic. We’ve got a lot of people involved.
Excuse me. Excuse me. He didn’t say a lot. He said we did a phenomenal job. He didn’t say a lot. He didn’t say, “You did a good job on ventilators, but nothing else.” No. He said we did a phenomenal job, so report accurately because you are one of the most inaccurate reporters. Go ahead.
They said the same thing with ventilators and now we have so many that we’re going to be able to send them and help other countries that are in need.
We’re in great shape. It’s so easy to get. Reagents and swabs are so easy to get. When you have to build a very expensive piece of machinery controlled by computers, that’s a different thing, and no, everything’s going to be in very good shape very soon. We’re going to be in very good shape very soon. Yeah, please go ahead.
Well, I don’t want to comment on it, but we will be saving that for another time.
And by the way, so states and local governments need it. I’m the first one to admit that. We’re going to be saving that for another little bit of a later date, will probably be our next negotiation, but I’m in favor of it, I will say, and I told the Republicans today. I had, I think, a great talk with a Republican senators today, and all of them, I think, just about all of them, and a conference call, and that’ll be a very big topic over the next a couple of weeks. It’s very important.
Well that’s another one. Yeah. That’s another one. You have hotels that are a big mess of buildings that are under levered, but if you have no income at all coming out, no income at all, these hotels, they go from under levered to they have to be closed down. It’s a terrible thing. I don’t know that they’re working on that specific problem, but it’s a problem they should be talking about. I mean you have people that own a hotel where they go from having a very successful hotel with many employees, thousands of people, to all of a sudden closing it down. I read where my wonderful place in Florida, in Miami, Doral, they had let a lot of the employees go because it’s essentially closed. You can’t use it. You can’t have the restaurants. So you have to close it down.
That’s an example. Many, many hotels are closing down throughout the country and hopefully they’re going to be able to open up relatively quickly.
Well, it depends how the hotel’s considered. Is it owned by a big chain? But even if it’s owned by a big chain, that’s devastating. If they have 200 hotels in the country and they’re closed, and it’s not only in the country, remember this, this is all over the world. They could have 2000 hotels that are in other countries. They’re also closed. We’re in better shape than most when you think about it. So I think we’re going to be looking at it. I think it’s a very big problem and it’s a lot of people employed. Yeah, here we go.
I will tell you this. What I’m doing is I’m standing up for the men and women that have done such an incredible job, not for me, for the men and women, admirals, Vice President, if I might, but all of the men and women, thousands, tens of thousands of them, they built hospitals in New York and New Jersey and all over this country in record time. They’d throw up a thousand beds in four days. I’m sticking up for those people. Those people have been incredible. I’m also sticking up for doctors and nurses and military doctors and nurses.
Those people have been just absolutely excoriated by some of the fake news like you. You’re CNN. You’re fake news, and let me just tell you, they were excoriated by people like you that don’t know any better because you don’t have the brains you were born with. You should be praising the people that have done a good job, not doing what you do, even that question. So just so you understand-
I’ll tell you why now. Are you ready? Because these people are right now in hospitals. It’s dangerous. It’s not about me.
Nothing’s about me. Look, you’re never going to treat me fairly, many of you, and I understand that. I don’t even know, I got here with the worst, most unfair press treatment they say in the history of the United States for a President. They did say Abraham Lincoln had very bad treatment, too. Let me just-
Well, that’s a positive thing because that’s an exercise in how to do it and what to do and that’s good for the future. People can learn from that. But I want the men and women of this country that are in danger, the admirals and the generals that have done a job like they’ve never done before, they’re in war. We’re in war. You know, I call it the invisible enemy. That’s their war and it’s a dangerous war. We’re also at a level when you said 40,000 people, and you’re right, almost 40,000 people and-
Oh, more than, okay, good. Correct me.
Correct me. Good. Well, I’m really glad you corrected me, CNN, but here’s the story. Let me just tell you something. If we didn’t do what we did, the 40,000 right now could be a million people. It could be a million people, not 40,000. it could be a million. We’re tracking at much less than the lowest possible estimate, and that’s a great tribute to a number of people in a number of things. One of the things that it’s attributed to is what’s taken place in this country with the American people because they’ve gone inside. They’ve done it. They’ve done a job that nobody thought was possible, and in fact, when they did the models, as they call them, nobody thought it was possible. They did models not based on this kind of success.
I’ve seen New York streets and I see it in the morning. I’ve watched all my life, New York streets, and you can’t even see the pavement, there’s so many people. And you take a look this morning, you take a look even on Friday morning, I looked at it. I saw it through a camera. There wasn’t a person on Fifth Avenue. There wasn’t a person on Madison Avenue. I’ve never seen anything like it because people have really listened to instructions, and they’ve listened to what we’ve had to say, and the professionals, they’ve listened, and people should really give them a lot of credit, including people like you, because you just don’t have the sense to understand what’s going on. All right. Yeah, please, go ahead.
Well, it would depend. It would depend. I don’t know much about any of those companies, but a lot of times they’re owned by franchisees where they own one or two places, and you know they are small businesses, so that would depend on what the formula is. But again, many of those companies are out to franchisees. A franchisee could open up one of the places that you mentioned and so yeah, I would say that’s important, actually. That’s like a restaurant. Go ahead, please.
You are in the media?
I’ve seen the people. I’ve seen the interviews of the people. These are great people. Look, they want to get, they call cabin fever, you’ve heard the term. They’ve got cabin fever. They want to get back. They want their life back. Their life was taken away from them, and you know, they learned a lot during this period. They learned to do things differently than they have in the past and they’ll do it hopefully until the virus has passed. And when the virus passes, I hope we’re going to be sitting next to each other and baseball games, football games, basketball games, ice hockey games. I hope we’re going to be sitting next to each other. I hope you have golf. The Masters is going to have 100,000 people, not 25 people watching at the course.
No, I’m not. I’ve never seen so many American flags. I mean I, I’m seeing the same thing that you’re seeing. I don’t see it any differently.
They’re who?
Well that I totally would say no way, but I didn’t see that. I see all, of course, I’m sure the news plays that up. I’ve seen American flags all over the place. I have never seen so many American flags at a rally as I have in these rallies. These people love our country. They want to get back to work.
Well, I just tell you this. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly. Paul Manafort, the black book turned out to be a fraud. We learned that out during the various last number of weeks or months. They had a black book that came out of Ukraine, turned out to be a fraud. Turned out to be a fraud. They convicted a man, turned out to be a fraud. General Flynn was a highly respected person and it turned out to be a scam on him. The FBI said he didn’t lie and Mueller’s people wanted him to go to jail. Okay? So what am I going to do? You’ll find out what I’m going to do. I’m not going to say what I’m going to do, but I will tell you the whole thing turned out to be a scam, and it turned out to be a disgrace to our country, and it was a take down of a duly elected President.
And these people suffered greatly. General Flynn, I mean what they did to him, and even the FBI said, and they had some, and nobody bigger fan of the FBI than me at the level of the people that really matter. But the top of the FBI was scum, and what they did to General Flynn, and you know it and everybody knows it, was a disgrace. He was in the service for over 30 years. He ends up being a general and respected, respected, and almost his first day in office, they come in with papers. They want to investigate him. Never happened before and now the tables are turned. Investigate the investigators, I guess. These were crooked people. These are bad people. These are very dangerous people. You know what they are though? They’re scum. They’re human scum. You want to have one in the back? Please.
Well, it’s not from me. I mean, they came in and they had some problems early on, but we’ve straightened it out. But yeah, look, I told you we inherited a lot of garbage. They had tests that were no good. They had all this stuff was no good. Came from somewhere, so whoever came up with it, but I’m proud to tell you that now we went from having a lot of bad things happening in CDC to having great things happening. They’re doing a very good job now. But no, initially, look, our stockpiles were empty. We had horrible stockpiles. We had horrible ventilators. We had very few of them, too, and so did the states have very few of them. But all of these things are now we’re at a level that we’ve never been. Same with our military. Our military is the strongest it’s ever been.
We spent one and a half trillion dollars on our military. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. It’s never been at a position, and we even have Space Force. Mike and I were talking about what an achievement that is. First time in 72 years we have a new force. So yeah, CDC had obsolete tests, old tests, broken tests and a mess. But they’ve done a very good job, and they’ve done it under pressure. They had to do this under pressure, so we’re very proud of the job they’ve done. Please go ahead.
Well, we already have millions coming in. We have one company that we’re forced to use it with, and probably by tomorrow we won’t be. You know it’s a tremendous hammer. Probably by tomorrow it won’t be, but we have millions of them coming in. They’re very easy. And in all fairness, governors could get them themselves. They really could. All of this, but we’re going to do it. We’re going to work with the governors, and if they can’t do it, we’re going to do it. If they do it, we can do it maybe cheaper, better. We’re getting very high quality. With us, it’s all quality, too. Even if it takes a little bit longer, we want the highest quality in all of it, including the ventilators. So yeah, we have millions of them coming in very soon and many of them already have been ordered, and the governors don’t know quite where they are, but they’ll be finding them fairly soon.
Go ahead.
Well, based on an investigation we’re going to find out. Yeah.
No, no, no, no. I made a deal that’s phenomenal for the United States. No, you know who was duped? You, and the Obama administration were duped for years because China was ripping off this country. Like in the history of any country, nobody’s been ripped off like the United States by China and many other countries. And we stop it, and we’ve done a deal where they’re paying us 250, they are buying 250, they didn’t do anything for us. You know, we didn’t even have a deal. It was so bad. It is about a deal because the deal started a long time ago before anybody heard about this. The deal was finished a number of months ago. Very happy, I was very happy. I hope they were happy. Billions of dollars came in in tariffs, billions of dollars. They’re going to be purchasing billions.
Listen CNN. I told you I’m not happy about it. And this was after the deal. So we have this wonderful deal. And nobody’s been tougher before the deal ever on China than Trump. Then I made a deal. I was very happy with the deal. It’s a great deal, great for our farmers. The farmers had been paid a fortune already. No mistake, we made a great deal.
You people are so pathetic at CNN. Let me just tell you. I was very happy with the deal, very happy with everything. Then we find out about the plague, right, the plague, and since we found out about that, I’m not happy. You know, she was having parties in San Francisco. Let’s all go to Chinatown, and that was a long time after I closed up the country.
That’s why your ratings are so bad because you’re pathetic. Go ahead. Let’s go. Your ratings are terrible. You got to get back to real news. Go ahead.
Well, we’re looking at it, we’re talking about it. The delivery has been very good, as you know. People are getting them and they’re happy. It’s saving lives. And you’ve seen that. By the way, you’ve seen that better than anyone and you people have actually covered it with you know, within, okay, but you’ve seen what’s going on, and we got those checks out to people. It saved their lives. Nobody else could’ve done it. If we get this new check out to the workers in these small, essentially to the workers of these small businesses to PPP, we’re going to be very happy because as we open, those businesses are going to open along with us. Yeah, go ahead.
I could see that, too. We’re coordinating right now with both. I spoke with the President of Mexico yesterday. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Canada a lot, Justin, and we’re in very good coordination right now.
We’re doing the supply chain. It’s not going to affect trade. That’s part of trade and it’s not going to affect trade. And if it does, I will tell you, if a supply chain based in Mexico or Canada interrupts with our making a big product and an important product, or even a military product, we’re not going to be happy. Let me tell you that. Go ahead. One or two more. You didn’t go.
Who are you with?
Okay.
Yeah, it does. You know, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney. I had 52 Republican senators.
Well, I just don’t think, you know, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney. I don’t really want his advice. Go ahead, please.
Well, because she used to Senator from a great state, a state that I love, Georgia.
Well, that I don’t know. I really don’t know about that, but she’s a senator from Georgia and she was included in the list. Absolutely. Go ahead, please.
Many of the leaders, yeah.
You mean some of the ones that didn’t do well? I don’t say that, but you just have to look. And some of them just got hit hard. When I closed up our border, when I did the ban on China, they say a lot of the people that didn’t come in here went to Italy. You’ve heard that. That’s why Italy was hit so hard. I don’t think it was because of government. I will say Italy is locked down probably more than any other country right now. It’s just absolutely locked solid down. But they got hit very hard because people that were coming to the United States couldn’t come, because I closed the country in January, and they went to Italy. They say it had to do with trade. It had to do with the purchase of certain materials, and Italy was another alternative.
And so many, many people went to Italy instead of coming here. And Italy has suffered greatly. Now, I spoke with the Prime Minister a lot. He’s a great friend of mine, and what’s happened to Italy is very, very tough. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. We’ll see you tomorrow. Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,1997-02-05,"Hi Howard.
You can call me Donald and I tell you it's been a lot of fun.
Miss Universe.
Right.
More or less, yes.
Well, that was an amazing one.
She was from one 118 to almost 170.
Well, she's going to be there. She is probably 145 or something.
Well, you know we had a lot of pressure.
Your wife is beautiful.
Your wife -- your wife is a winner and your wife is beautiful.
She looks great. She never looked better, Howard.
Well, you know it's an amazing phenomenon. She weighed 118 --
She won -- She's the beautiful a woman as I've ever seen.
Right. She gained about 55 lbs in a period of nine months.
She was like an eating machine.
I think she ate a lot of everything.
Terminate her crown. You know her -- her Miss Universe rights.
It has become a major event.
Right.
No. Actually, she's going to be on tonight. I'm in Louisiana today because they have the Miss USA pageant, which is turned into a big deal.
She's hosting it tonight with George Hamilton, it's on CBS.
You know what, Howard? He's amazing, I just saw --
The tan looks great and he's great at what he does.
She actually does, I would say.
No work. Zero work.
Well, you watch tonight, you'll see.
It's 6:20 in the morning in Louisiana, I'm just thinking about this.
How many what?
I think she probably has three or four. I knew it was very funny cause last night, late, you know they were rehearsing, 51 girls represent each state, and the District of Columbia and I was absolutely there and I've never seen so many unbelievably beautiful girls.
It's a tough business. You know it's a tough world.
I said to a friend of mine as I walk into this room and you're mobbed by all these incredible girls, I said, you know somebody has to do this, it might as well be me cause it is really amazing, so beautiful these girls.
A little bit, a little bit.
Well, I hope. You know, speaking of your wife, I was at the opening of Chicago, which was terrific, about a few months ago and I was with a group of people and one of the people pointed your wife, I had no idea who she was, said, there is a beautiful woman, okay.
Now I looked over and it was your wife.
But I thought it was interesting. You're very lucky, Howard. You are very lucky.
This is wild. I've never seen anything like it.
You know we have Miss Universe coming up in May and that's all over the world. And in fact, if you'd like to be a judge --
It's probably in Miami Beach.
Because she had various venues right now. But it's in the middle of May. And if you'd like to be a judge you would see something that would be unbelievable.
Bring your wife.
The offer's open to you to be a judge, Howard.
Yeah. And you'll see something like you've -- You know what, Robin, he will see something like even he has never seen before.
They have to watch closely.
I tell you what, he does look terrific.
Now, Dominick got in trouble when I went over to your birthday, I heard Dominick said I had a problem regarding trouble -- everyone was telling me.
What happened?
I don't know, he's the one, he kept calling me. You gotta come, you gotta come. It's Howard's birthday, you gotta come, and you know, I went over but I heard Dominique's sort of got in trouble with your producer.
I don't really hang out. I never met him until last night, actually. I tell you what, I was really --
That's true. That worked very much to his advantage.
From what I understand.
I would say the Filipinos who are really too hot on that idea.
We'll, you know, it's unbelievable that that took so long.
It was -- it was -- you know, You could make the case of double jeopardy, isn't this double jeopardy, but the attitude is, who cares?
Well, you know, and I got myself into a little bit of a problem, they said, how are you gonna change the pageant because I bought it from ITT, you know the term is ITT, that's now under siege.
I bought it a few months ago from ITT and so somebody called up from Reader's Digest and they said, what change is he gonna make to bring it up. I said, well, you know cause it gives huge ratings, they've always gotten great ratings. And I said, well, the primary change is, I'm gonna get the bathing suits to be smaller and the heels to be higher.
And we're gonna bring it in. And a lot of people wanted to see it sort of, updated, so we're gonna update it.
Very tiny.
And by the time I get it, you know, by the time I have it for a year, forget it.
It's a little gradual.
It will be a lot of fun, Howard.
You take care.
And Robin, take care of yourself.
So long.
Okay, you have a deal.
So long.
",Interview: Donald Trump on The Howard Stern Show,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-howard-stern-show-february-5-1997
Theresa May,United Kingdom,2018-03-13,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on the incident in Salisbury – and the steps we are taking to investigate what happened and to respond to this reckless and despicable act.
Last week my Rt Hon Friends, the Foreign and Home Secretaries, set out the details of events as they unfolded on Sunday the 4th of March.
I am sure the whole House will want to once again pay tribute to the bravery and professionalism of our emergency services and armed forces in responding to this incident, as well as the doctors and nurses who are now treating those affected.
Our thoughts, in particular, are with Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey who remains in a serious but stable condition. In responding to this incident, he exemplified the duty and courage that define our emergency services; and in which our whole nation takes the greatest pride.
Mr Speaker, I want to pay tribute to the fortitude and calmness with which people in Salisbury have responded to these events and to thank all those who have come forward to assist the police with their investigation.
This incident has, of course, caused considerable concern across the community. Following the discovery of traces of nerve agent in Zizzi’s restaurant and The Mill pub, the Chief Medical Officer issued further precautionary advice. But as Public Health England have made clear, the risk to public health is low.
Mr Speaker, I share the impatience of this House and the country at large to bring those responsible to justice – and to take the full range of appropriate responses against those who would act against our country in this way.
But as a nation that believes in justice and the rule of law, it is essential that we proceed in the right way – led not by speculation but by the evidence.
That is why we have given the police the space and time to carry out their investigation properly.
Hundreds of officers have been working around the clock – together with experts from our armed forces – to sift and assess all the available evidence; to identify crime scenes and decontamination sites and to follow every possible lead to find those responsible.
That investigation continues and we must allow the police to continue with their work.
Mr Speaker, this morning I chaired a meeting of the National Security Council in which we considered the information so far available. As is normal, the Council was updated on the assessment and intelligence picture, as well as the state of the investigation.
It is now clear that Mr Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia.
This is part of a group of nerve agents known as ‘Novichok’.
Based on the positive identification of this chemical agent by world-leading experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down; our knowledge that Russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so; Russia’s record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations; and our assessment that Russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations; the Government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei and Yulia Skripal.
Mr Speaker, there are therefore only two plausible explanations for what happened in Salisbury on the 4th of March.
Either this was a direct act by the Russian State against our country.
Or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others.
This afternoon my Rt Hon Friend the Foreign Secretary has summoned the Russian Ambassador to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and asked him to explain which of these two possibilities it is – and therefore to account for how this Russian-produced nerve agent could have been deployed in Salisbury against Mr Skripal and his daughter.
My Rt Hon Friend has stated to the Ambassador that the Russian Federation must immediately provide full and complete disclosure of the Novichok programme to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
And he has requested the Russian Government’s response by the end of tomorrow.
Mr Speaker, this action has happened against a backdrop of a well-established pattern of Russian State aggression.
Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea was the first time since the Second World War that one sovereign nation has forcibly taken territory from another in Europe.
Russia has fomented conflict in the Donbas, repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries, and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption. This has included meddling in elections, and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag, among many others.
During his recent State of the Union address, President Putin showed video graphics of missile launches, flight trajectories and explosions, including the modelling of attacks on the United States with a series of warheads impacting in Florida.
While the extra-judicial killing of terrorists and dissidents outside Russia were given legal sanction by the Russian Parliament in 2006.
And of course Russia used radiological substances in its barbaric assault on Mr Litvinenko. We saw promises to assist the investigation then, but they resulted in denial and obfuscation – and the stifling of due process and the rule of law.
Mr Speaker, following Mr Litvinenko’s death we expelled Russian diplomats, suspended security co-operation, broke off bilateral plans on visas, froze the assets of the suspects and put them on international extradition lists. And these measures remain in place.
Furthermore our commitment to collective defence and security through NATO remains as strong as ever in the face of Russian behaviour.
Indeed our armed forces have a leading role in NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence with British troops leading a multinational battlegroup in Estonia.
We have led the way in securing tough sanctions against the Russian economy.
And we have at all stages worked closely with our allies and we will continue to do so.
We must now stand ready to take much more extensive measures.
Mr Speaker, on Wednesday we will consider in detail the response from the Russian State.
Should there be no credible response, we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom.
And I will come back to this House and set out the full range of measures that we will take in response.
Mr Speaker, this attempted murder using a weapons-grade nerve agent in a British town was not just a crime against the Skripals.
It was an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk.
And we will not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.
I commend this Statement to the House.
",2018 Statement on Salisbury Attack,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-may-2018-statement-on-salisbury-attack/
Dwight D. Eisenhower,United States of America,1953-04-16 00:00:00,"In this spring of 1953 the free world weighs one question above all others: the chance for a just peace for all peoples.
To weigh this chance is to summon instantly to mind another recent moment of great decision. It came with that yet more hopeful spring of 1945, bright with the promise of victory and of freedom. The hope of all just men in that moment too was a just and lasting peace.
The 8 years that have passed have seen that hope waver, grow dim, and almost die. And the shadow of fear again has darkly lengthened across the world.
In that spring of victory the soldiers of the Western Allies met the soldiers of Russia in the center of Europe. They were triumphant comrades in arms. Their peoples shared the joyous prospect of building, in honor of their dead, the only fitting monument -- an age of just peace. All these war-weary peoples shared too this concrete, decent purpose: to guard vigilantly against the domination ever again of any part of the world by a single, unbridled aggressive power.
This common purpose lasted an instant and perished. The nations of the world divided to follow two distinct roads.
The United States and our valued friends, the other free nations, chose one road.
The leaders of the Soviet Union chose another.
The way chosen by the United States was plainly marked by a few clear precepts, which govern its conduct in world affairs.
First: No people on earth can be held, as a people, to be an enemy, for all humanity shares the common hunger for peace and fellowship and justice.
Second: No nation's security and well-being can be lastingly achieved in isolation but only in effective cooperation with fellow nations.
Third: Any nation's right to a form of government and an economic system of its own choosing is inalienable.
Fourth: Any nation's attempt to dictate to other nations their form of government is indefensible.
And fifth: A nation's hope of lasting peace cannot be firmly based upon any race in armaments but rather upon just relations and honest understanding with all other nations.
In the light of these principles the citizens of the United States defined the way they proposed to follow, through the aftermath of war, toward true peace.
This way was faithful to the spirit that inspired the United Nations: to prohibit strife, to relieve tensions, to banish fears. This way was to control and to reduce armaments. This way was to allow all nations to devote their energies and resources to the great and good tasks of healing the war's wounds, of clothing and feeding and housing the needy, of perfecting a just political life, of enjoying the fruits of their own free toil.
The Soviet government held a vastly different vision of the future.
In the world of its design, security was to be found, not in mutual trust and mutual aid but in force: huge armies, subversion, rule of neighbor nations. The goal was power superiority at all cost. Security was to be sought by denying it to all others.
The result has been tragic for the world and, for the Soviet Union, it has also been ironic.
The amassing of Soviet power alerted free nations to a new danger of aggression. It compelled them in self-defense to spend unprecedented money and energy for armaments. It forced them to develop weapons of war now capable of inflicting instant and terrible punishment upon any aggressor.
It instilled in the free nations -- and let none doubt this -- the unshakable conviction that, as long as there persists a threat to freedom, they must, at any cost, remain armed, strong, and ready for the risk of war.
It inspired them -- and let none doubt this -- to attain a unity of purpose and will beyond the power of propaganda or pressure to break, now or ever.
There remained, however, one thing essentially unchanged and unaffected by Soviet conduct: the readiness of the free nations to welcome sincerely any genuine evidence of peaceful purpose enabling all peoples again to resume their common quest of just peace.
The free nations, most solemnly and repeatedly, have assured the Soviet Union that their firm association has never had any aggressive purpose whatsoever. Soviet leaders, however, have seemed to persuade themselves, or tried to persuade their people, otherwise.
And so it has come to pass that the Soviet Union itself has shared and suffered the very fears it has fostered in the rest of the world.
This has been the way of life forged by 8 years of fear and force.
What can the world, or any nation in it, hope for if no turning is found on this dread road?
The worst to be feared and the best to be expected can be simply stated.
The worst is atomic war.
The best would be this: a life of perpetual fear and tension; a burden of arms draining the wealth and the labor of all peoples; a wasting of strength that defies the American system or the Soviet system or any system to achieve true abundance and happiness for the peoples of this earth.
Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone.
It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.
The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.
It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.
It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway.
We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat.
We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.
This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking.
This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.
This is one of those times in the affairs of nations when the gravest choices must be made, if there is to be a turning toward a just and lasting peace.
It is a moment that calls upon the governments of the world to speak their intentions with simplicity and with honesty.
It calls upon them to answer the question that stirs the hearts of all sane men: is there no other way the world may live?
The world knows that an era ended with the death of Joseph Stalin. The extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the Soviet Empire expand to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls.
The Soviet system shaped by Stalin and his predecessors was born of one World War. It survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second World War. It has lived to threaten a third.
Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make.
This new leadership confronts a free world aroused, as rarely in its history, by the will to stay free.
This free world knows, out of the bitter wisdom of experience, that vigilance and sacrifice are the price of liberty.
It knows that the defense of Western Europe imperatively demands the unity of purpose and action made possible by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, embracing a European Defense Community.
It knows that Western Germany deserves to be a free and equal partner in this community and that this, for Germany, is the only safe way to full, final unity.
It knows that aggression in Korea and in southeast Asia are threats to the whole free community to be met by united action.
This is the kind of free world which the new Soviet leadership confronts. It is a world that demands and expects the fullest respect of its rights and interests. It is a world that will always accord the same respect to all others.
So the new Soviet leadership now has a precious opportunity to awaken, with the rest of the world, to the point of peril reached and to help turn the tide of history.
Will it do this?
We do not yet know. Recent statements and gestures of Soviet leaders give some evidence that they may recognize this critical moment.
We welcome every honest act of peace.
We care nothing for mere rhetoric.
We are only for sincerity of peaceful purpose attested by deeds. The opportunities for such deeds are many. The performance of a great number of them waits upon no complex protocol but upon the simple will to do them. Even a few such clear and specific acts, such as the Soviet Union's signature upon an Austrian treaty or its release of thousands of prisoners still held from World War II, would be impressive signs of sincere intent. They would carry a power of persuasion not to be matched by any amount of oratory.
This we do know: a world that begins to witness the rebirth of trust among nations can find its 'way to a peace that is neither partial nor punitive.
With all who will work in good faith toward such a peace, we are ready, with renewed resolve, to strive to redeem the near-lost hopes of our day.
The first great step along this way must be the conclusion of an honorable armistice in Korea.
This means the immediate cessation of hostilities and the prompt initiation of political discussions leading to the holding of free elections in a united Korea.
It should mean, no less importantly, an end to the direct and indirect attacks upon the security of Indochina and Malaya. For any armistice in Korea that merely released aggressive armies to attack elsewhere would be a fraud.
We seek, throughout Asia as throughout the world, a peace that is true and total.
Out of this can grow a still wider task -- the achieving of just political settlements for the other serious and specific issues between the free world and the Soviet Union.
None of these issues, great or small, is insoluble -- given only the will to respect the rights of all nations.
Again we say: the United States is ready to assume its just part.
We have already done all within our power to speed conclusion of a treaty with Austria, which will free that country from economic exploitation and from occupation by foreign troops.
We are ready not only to press forward with the present plans for closer unity of the nations of Western Europe but also, upon that foundation, to strive to foster a broader European community, conducive to the free movement of persons, of trade, and of ideas.
This community would include a free and united Germany, with a government based upon free and secret elections.
This free community and the full independence of the East European nations could mean the end of the present unnatural division of Europe.
As progress in all these areas strengthens world trust, we could proceed concurrently with the next great work -- the reduction of the burden of armaments now weighing upon the world. To this end we would welcome and enter into the most solemn agreements. These could properly include:
1. The limitation, by absolute numbers or by an agreed international ratio, of the sizes of the military and security forces of all nations.
2. A commitment by all nations to set an agreed limit upon that proportion of total production of certain strategic materials to be devoted to military purposes.
3. International control of atomic energy to promote its use for peaceful purposes only and to insure the prohibition of atomic weapons.
4. A limitation or prohibition of other categories of weapons of great destructiveness.
5. The enforcement of all these agreed limitations and prohibitions by adequate safeguards, including a practical system of inspection under the United Nations.
The details of such disarmament programs are manifestly critical and complex. Neither the United States nor any other nation can properly claim to possess a perfect, immutable formula. But the formula matters less than the faith -- the good faith without which no formula can work justly and effectively.
The fruit of success in all these tasks would present the world with the greatest task, and the greatest opportunity, of all. It is this: the dedication of the energies, the resources, and the imaginations of all peaceful nations to a new kind of war. This would be a declared total war, not upon any human enemy but upon the brute forces of poverty and need.
The peace we seek, rounded upon decent trust and cooperative effort among nations, can be fortified, not by weapons of war but by wheat and by cotton, by milk and by wool, by meat and by timber and by rice. These are words that translate into every language on earth. These are needs that challenge this world in arms.
This idea of a just and peaceful world is not new or strange to us. It inspired the people of the United States to initiate the European Recovery Program in 1947. That program was prepared to treat, with like and equal concern, the needs of Eastern and Western Europe.
We are prepared to reaffirm, with the most concrete evidence, our readiness to help build a world in which all peoples can be productive and prosperous.
This Government is ready to ask its people to join with all nations in devoting a substantial percentage of the savings achieved by disarmament to a fund for world aid and reconstruction. The purposes of this great work would be to help other peoples to develop the undeveloped areas of the world, to stimulate profitable and fair world trade, to assist all peoples to know the blessings of productive freedom.
The monuments to this new kind of war would be these: roads and schools, hospitals and homes, food and health.
We are ready, in short, to dedicate our strength to serving the needs, rather than the fears, of the world.
We are ready, by these and all such actions, to make of the United Nations an institution that can effectively guard the peace and security of all peoples.
I know of nothing I can add to make plainer the sincere purpose of the United States.
I know of no course, other than that marked by these and similar actions, that can be called the highway of peace.
I know of only one question upon which progress waits. It is this:
What is the Soviet Union ready to do?
Whatever the answer be, let it be plainly spoken.
Again we say: the hunger for peace is too great, the hour in history too late, for any government to mock men's hopes with mere words and promises and gestures.
The test of truth is simple. There can be no persuasion but by deeds.
Is the new leadership of the Soviet Union prepared to use its decisive influence in the Communist world, including control of the flow of arms, to bring not merely an expedient truce in Korea but genuine peace in Asia?
Is it prepared to allow other nations, including those of Eastern Europe, the free choice of their own forms of government?
Is it prepared to act in concert with others upon serious disarmament proposals to be made firmly effective by stringent U. N. control and inspection?
If not, where then is the concrete evidence of the Soviet Union's concern for peace?
The test is clear.
There is, before all peoples, a precious chance to turn the black tide of events. If we failed to strive to seize this chance, the judgment of future ages would be harsh and just.
If we strive but fail and the world remains armed against itself, it at least need be divided no longer in its clear knowledge of who has condemned humankind to this fate.
The purpose of the United States, in stating these proposals, is simple and clear.
These proposals spring, without ulterior purpose or political passion, from our calm conviction that the hunger for peace is in the hearts of all peoples -- those of Russia and of China no less than of our own country.
They conform to our firm faith that God created men to enjoy, not destroy, the fruits of the earth and of their own toil.
They aspire to this: the lifting, from the backs and from the hearts of men, of their burden of arms and of fears, so that they may find before them a golden age of freedom and of peace.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-06-04,"Thank you very much, Theresa.
Well, thank you, Prime Minister May. Melania and I are honored to return to London as our nations commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day in World War Two. We want to thank Her Majesty the Queen, who I had a lovely dinner with last night -- a fantastic person, fantastic woman -- for so graciously inviting us to this State Visit.
It was very, very special. Our thanks as well to Prime Minister and Mr. May for the warm welcome they've given the First Lady and me, as we remember the heroes who laid down their lives to rescue civilization itself. On June 6th, 1944, tens of thousands of young warriors left these shores by the sea and air to begin the invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Europe and the brutal Nazi occupation.
It was a liberation like few people have seen before. Among them were more than 130,000 American and British brothers-in-arms. Through their valor and sacrifice, they secured our homelands and saved freedom for the world. Tomorrow, Prime Minister May and I will attend a commemoration ceremony in Portsmouth -- one of the key embarkation points for the invasion.
More than one and a half million American service members were stationed right here in England in advance of the landings that summer. The bonds of friendship forged here and sealed in blood on those hallowed beaches will endure forever. Our special relationship is grounded in common history, values, customs, culture, language, and laws.
Our people believe in freedom and independence as a sacred birthright and cherished inheritance worth defending at any cost. As the Prime Minister and I discussed in our meetings today and yesterday, the United States and the United Kingdom share many goals and priorities around the world. I want to thank the people of the United Kingdom for their service and partnership in our campaign to defeat ISIS. As we announced a few months ago, ISIS's territorial caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been completely obliterated -- defeated.
The United Kingdom is also a key partner in NATO. The Prime Minister and I agree that our NATO Allies must increase their defense spending. We've both been working very hard toward that end. And we are very current, and some of them are not. We can't allow that to happen. But I appreciate everything you've done in that regard.
We expect a growing number of nations to meet the minimum 2 percent of GDP requirement. To address today's challenges, all members of the Alliance must fulfill their obligations. They have no choice. They must fulfill their obligation. Among the pressing threats facing our nations is the development and spread of nuclear weapons.
Perhaps that's our greatest threat. The United States and the United Kingdom are determined to ensure that Iran never develops nuclear weapons, and stops supporting and engaging in terrorism. And I believe that will happen. In protecting our nations, we also know that the border security is national security.
Today, the Prime Minister and I discussed our thriving economic relationship -- both countries are doing very well -- and participated in a roundtable with industry and business leaders -- I can say, probably, the biggest business leaders anywhere in the world. Our nations have more than $1 trillion invested in each other's economics.
The United Kingdom is America's largest foreign investor and our largest European export market. That's a lot of importance. As the UK makes preparations to exit the European Union, the United States is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between the U.S. and the UK. There is tremendous potential in that trade deal -- I say, probably, two and even three times of what we're doing right now.
Tremendous potential. Seventy-five years ago this Thursday, courageous Americans and British patriots set out from this island toward history's most important battle. They stormed forward out of ships and airplanes, risking everything to defend our people and to ensure that the United States and Britain would forever remain sovereign and forever remain free.
Following this press conference, Prime Minister May, Mr. May, the First Lady, my family, and I will visit the legendary Churchill War Rooms beneath the streets of London. I look forward to that. In his famous speech on this day in June 1940, Prime Minister Churchill urged his countrymen to ""defend our island, whatever the cost may be."" As we mark this solemn anniversary of D-Day, we remember that the defense of our nations does not begin on the battlefield but within the heart of every patriot.
Today, let us renew our pledge, engraved at the American Cemetery in Normandy and inscribed by President Dwight Eisenhower in St. Paul's Cathedral right here in London, that ""the cause for which they died shall live."" Prime Minister May, it's been a true honor. I have greatly enjoyed working with you.
You are a tremendous professional and a person that loves your country dearly. Thank you very much. Really an honor. Thank you for the invitation to memorialize our fallen heroes and for your partnership in protecting and advancing the extraordinary alliance between the American and the British people. It's the greatest alliance the world has ever known.
Thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're talking about the Mayor of London. Is that who you said? Yes? Well, I think he's been a -- a not very good mayor, from what I understand. He's done a poor job. Crime is up. A lot of problems. And I don't think he should be criticizing a representative of the United States that can do so much good for the United Kingdom.
We talked about it before: He should be positive, not negative. He's a negative force, not a positive force. And if you look at what he said, he hurts the people of this great country. And I think he should actually focus on his job. It'd be a lot better if he did that. He could straighten out some of the problems that he has and probably some of the problems that he's caused.
Thank you.
Jeremy -- yes. Yes, he wanted to meet with me and I told him no.
Yes.
Well, I don't know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him. Never spoke to him. He wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that. I think that he is -- from where I come from -- somewhat of a negative force. I think that the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize.
I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done. So I've decided not to meet. As far as the protests, I have to tell you, because I commented on it yesterday: We left the Prime Minister, the Queen, the Royal Family -- there were thousands of people on the streets cheering.
And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering. And then I heard that there were protests. I said, ""Where are the protests? I don't see any protests."" I did see a small protest today when I came -- very small. So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. But you saw the people waving the American flag, waving your flag; it was tremendous spirit and love.
There was great love. It was an alliance. And I didn't see the protestors until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So it was fake news. Thank you.
It's very big, and this really is a very big and important alliance. And I think people should act positively toward it because it means so much for both countries. It means so much and it's been so good. Steve Holland, yes. Go ahead, Steve.
Well, I don't like to take positions in things that I'm not, you know, really -- I understand the issue very well. I really predicted what was going to happen. Some of you remember that prediction. It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location, on a development we were opening the day before it happened.
And I thought it was going to happen because of immigration more than anything else, but probably it happens for a lot of reasons. But I would say, yeah, I would think that it will happen and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country and it wants its own identity. It wants to have its own borders.
It wants to run its own affairs. This is a very, very special place. And I think it deserves a special place. And I thought maybe for that reason -- and for others -- but that reason, it was going to happen. Yeah, I think it will happen, and I believe the Prime Minister has brought it to a very good point where something will take place in the not-too-distant future.
I think she's done a very good job. I believe it would be good for the country. Yes.
No, because we're going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. I think we're not going to have it. We did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We've never had limitations.
This is a truly great ally and partner, and we'll have no problem with that. Okay?
I think we're going to have a great trade deal, yes. I think we're going to have a great and very comprehensive trade deal --
I can't hear him. What?
Look, I think everything with a trade deal is on the table. When you -- when you're dealing in trade, everything is on the table -- so, NHS or anything else. There are a lot -- a lot more than that. But everything will be on the table, absolutely. Okay.
John, please.
That's good.
Not ""possibly be.""
No, we haven't started yet.
Yeah, the threat is out there, but we haven't really started yet. No, this will take effect next week -- the 5 percent.
Oh, I don't think they will do that. I think if they do, it's foolish. There's nothing more important than borders. I've had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90 percent -- 94 percent approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That's an all-time record. Can you believe that?
Isn't that something? I love records. But we have a 94 percent approval rating in the Republican Party. I want to see security at our border. I'm going to see great trade. I'm going to see a lot of things happening. And that is happening. And as you know, Mexico called. They want to meet. They're going to meet on Wednesday.
Secretary Pompeo is going to be at the meeting, along with a few others that are very good at this. And we are going to see if we can do something. But I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on. And we'll probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on and they're going to be paid. And if they don't step up and give us security for our nation -- look, millions of people are flowing through Mexico.
That's unacceptable. Millions and millions of people are coming right through Mexico. It's a 2,000-mile journey. And they're coming up to our border. And our Border Patrol, which is incredible -- they're apprehending them, but our laws are bad because the Democrats don't want to pass laws that could be passed in 15 minutes, that could be passed quickly.
In one day, it could change. But even beyond the laws, Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try and enter our country. And they could stop it very quickly, and I think they will. And if they won't, we're going to put tariffs on. And every month, those tariffs go from 5 percent, to 10 percent, to 15 percent, to 20, and then to 25 percent.
And what will happen then is all of those companies that have left our country and gone to Mexico are going to be coming back to us. And that's okay. That's okay. But I think Mexico will step up and do what they should have been done. And I don't want to hear that Mexico is run by the cartels and the drug lords and the coyotes.
I don't want to hear about that. A lot of people are saying that. Mexico has something to prove. But I don't want to hear that they're run by the cartels. You understand. You report on it all the time. A lot of people do. That would be a terrible thing. Mexico should step up and stop this onslaught, this invasion into our country, John.
Yeah. That's not such a -- I would have sued, but that's okay. But you never know. But you know what? She has got it, in a sense, John. That deal is teed up. I think that deal is really teed up. I think they have to do something.
And perhaps you won't be given the credit that you deserve if they do something, but I think you deserve a lot of credit. I really do. I think you deserve a lot of credit. Okay? Yes, John?
So, I know Boris. I like him. I've liked him for a long time. He's -- I think he'd do a very good job. I know Jeremy. I think he'd do a very good job. I don't know Michael. But would he do a good job -- Jeremy? Tell me.
Good. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.

I just congratulated him. I said, ""Congratulations, that was well fought."" I mean who would have thought a thing like that could have happened what he's been through. Everything was uncorroborated.
I want to thank the FBI. I thought the FBI was incredible. They worked hard, and they worked really fast, and I hear the report was -- was really, detailed, thorough, professional report. So I wanted to thank them.
I want to thank the Justice Department, because they also -- they were working along with the FBI really hard, really fast, and I think this actually -- the extra week delay was a was a terrific thing for the process.
So we have a great new Supreme Court justice, and he's going to be there for many years. We are very, very proud of him, and what he and his family had to endure. And it's a -- it's a great testament, and it's a testament also to our country.

Andrew Jackson,United States of America,1830-05-06 00:00:00,"To the Senate of the United States.
It is certainly desirous, on various and very pressing accounts, as will appear from the accompanying documents, that some agreement should be concluded with the Indians by which an object so important as their removal beyond the territorial limits of the States may be effected. In settling the terms of such an agreement I am disposed to exercise the utmost liberality, and to concur in any which are consistent with the Constitution and not incompatible with the interests of the United States and their duties to the Indians. I can not, however, regard the terms proposed by the Choctaws to be in all respects of this character; but desirous of concluding an arrangement upon such as are, I have drawn up the accompanying amendments, which I propose to offer to the Choctaws if they meet the approbation of the Senate. The conditions which they offer are such as, in my judgment, will be most likely to be acceptable to both parties and are liable to the fewest objections. Not being tenacious, though, on the subject, I will most cheerfully adopt any modifications which on a frank interchange of opinions my constitutional advisers may suggest and which I shall be satisfied are reconcilable with my official duties.
With these views, I ask the opinion of the Senate upon the following questions:
Will the Senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with the Choctaw Nation according to the terms which they propose? Or will the Senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with that tribe as modified by the alterations suggested by me? If not, what further alteration or modification will the Senate propose?
I am fully aware that in thus resorting to the early practice of the Government, by asking the previous advice of the Senate in the discharge of this portion of my duties, I am departing from a long and for many years an unbroken usage in similar cases. But being satisfied that this resort is consistent with the provisions of the Constitution, that it is strongly recommended in this instance by considerations of expediency, and that the reasons which have led to the observance of a different practice, though very cogent in negotiations with foreign nations, do not apply with equal force to those made with Indian tribes, I flatter myself that it will not meet the disapprobation of the Senate. Among the reasons for a previous expression of the views of the Senate the following are stated as most prominent:
1. The Indians have requested that their propositions should be submitted to the Senate.
2. The opinion of the Senate in relation to the terms to be proposed will have a salutary effect in a future negotiation, if one should be deemed proper.
3. The Choctaw is one of the most numerous and powerful tribes within our borders, and as the conclusion of a treaty with them may have a controlling effect upon other tribes it is important that its terms should be well considered. Those now proposed by the Choctaws, though objectionable, it is believed are susceptible of modifications which will leave them conformable to the humane and liberal policy which the Government desires to observe toward the Indian tribes, and be at the same time acceptable to them. To be possessed of the views of the Senate on this important and delicate branch of our future negotiations would enable the President to act much more effectively in the exercise of his particular functions. There is also the best reason to believe that measures in this respect emanating from the united counsel of the treaty-making power would be more satisfactory to the American people and to the Indians.
It will be seen that the pecuniary stipulations are large; and in bringing this subject to the consideration of the Senate I may be allowed to remark that the amount of money which may be secured to be paid should, in my judgment, be viewed as of minor importance. If a fund adequate to the object in view can be obtained from the lands which they cede, all the purposes of the Government should be regarded as answered. The great desideratum is the removal of the Indians and the settlement of the perplexing question involved in their present location--a question in which several of the States of this Union have the deepest interest, and which, if left undecided much longer, may eventuate in serious injury to the Indians.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-24,"Hello everyone.
This has been a heartbreaking week for Nova Scotians and for all Canadians.
At 2:00 p.m. Atlantic time, we will observe a minute of silence in honour of Constable Heidi Stevenson and all the victims of the Nova Scotia shooting.
I also want to remind everyone that at 7:00 p.m. Atlantic time or 6:00 p.m. Eastern time, a virtual vigil will be held to remember those who were taken from us too soon and support their friends and family during this particularly difficult time.
I hope that many of you will join us and wear red today in a show of solidarity.
Let’s come together to support these communities who suffered immeasurable loss.
Let’s celebrate the lives of those who left us too soon. Let us remember the families, friends, loved ones whose absence will linger for years and lives.
You can find more information at novascotiaremembers.com
Since the beginning of the outbreak, our government has been working with its provincial and territorial partners not only to get through this crisis, but to position our economy to rebound once it’s over.
And a big part of this work means listening to the concerns of Canadians and making adjustments as we go along.
One thing we’ve heard is that small businesses are having trouble making rent because of COVID-19.
If you’ve had to close up shop because of public health recommendations, if you don’t have a lot of money coming in because people aren’t spending as much these days – you may be worried about losing your office space or not having a coffee shop to reopen after this crisis.
So last week, we said that we’re planning on introducing the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance.
And today I can announce that we’ve reached agreements with all provinces and territories to lower rent by 75 per cent for small businesses that have been strongly affected by COVID-19 for April, May, and June.
The government will cover 50 per cent of that reduction, with the property owner covering the rest.
If you are a small business that has been strongly affected by COVID-19 and you’re paying less than $50,000 per month on rent, you’ll be eligible to receive this support.
It will also be there for non-profits and charitable organizations that are struggling right now.
We’ll also have more to say in the coming days about rent support for larger businesses.
As I said yesterday, what we’re witnessing in long-term care facilities across the country is extremely troubling.
It’s unacceptable and our government will be there to help the provinces.
Members of the Canadian Armed Forces will be deployed after the Minister of Public Safety received and approved two formal requests from Ontario and Quebec.
Reconnaissance work is underway in both provinces. We’re identifying what needs to be done and mapping out next steps.
As I said many times before, we will be there for Quebecers, Ontarians, and all Canadians during this crisis.
We’re deploying the military to provide emergency support to help provinces regain control of the situation.
But we all know that this is only a short-term solution.
We’re also offering billions of dollars to provinces to top up the pay of essential workers and make sure that elderly Canadians get the support they deserve.
Later today, I’ll be meeting with the First Ministers to continue our work on supporting Canadians during this time.
We’re also going to talk about reopening parts of the economy.
Canada is a vast country and some regions have been hit harder than others during this pandemic.
We’re a federation, so we have to adapt our response to the realities and challenges of each province and territory.
But I want to be clear that getting back to normal will not happen overnight.
It’s going to take time. It won’t be as simple or as easy as flipping a switch.
It’ll require a lot of coordination at the national level and our government will be there to do that work.
We will be working with the provinces and territories to establish principles and guidelines to start reopening the economy safely.
Over the coming weeks, you’ll hear more talk about reopening, but you need to know we’re not out of the woods.
Since the beginning of this crisis, we have been learning about what’s being done in countries like South Korea, Japan, and Singapore.
But we see the challenges associated with reopening in certain places. So we have to be very careful.
Every location could take a different approach, so even if you hear on the news that another province is considering relaxing the rules, you must continue following the guidelines that apply in your location.
Otherwise, there’s a real risk that all the progress we have made to date will be lost.
It’s absolutely critical that everyone continues to follow local public health instructions as we move forward.
For now, these instructions are the same for all Canadians.
No matter where you live, you should be staying home as much as you possibly can.
You should be washing your hands regularly and you should always keep a safe distance of two metres from others.
That is the only way for us to make it through together.
Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-08-29,"Thank you very much. It's a great honor. What a beautiful day in the Rose Garden. Please sit. Thank you. To ensure that all resources of the federal government are focused on the arriving storm, I have decided to send our Vice President, Mike Pence, to Poland this weekend, in my place. It's something very important for me to be here.
The storm looks like it could be a very, very big one indeed. And Mike will be going. I've just spoken to President Duda of Poland, and expressed to him my warmest wishes and the wishes of the American people. Our highest priority is the safety and security of the people in the path of the hurricane. And I will be rescheduling my trip to Poland in the near future.
We're gathered here in the Rose Garden to establish the United States Space Command. It's a big deal. As the newest combatant command, SPACECOM will defend America’s vital interests in space -- the next warfighting domain. And I think that's pretty obvious to everybody. It's all about space. We're joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark Esper, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joe Maguire, Acting Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, Acting Secretary of the Air Force Matt Donovan, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford, and Congressman Mike Turner.
We're especially grateful to welcome the new leader of SPACECOM, General Jay Raymond, a highly respected man within the military, joined this afternoon by his wife Mollie -- thank you. Thank you, Mollie. Congratulations, Mollie. It's great. Their wonderful family and several of their friends. General Raymond, congratulations.
So important. I know he's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you very much. Each of the United States military’s combatant commands has an area of responsibility, from CENTCOM, which oversees our mission in the Middle East, to our most recent, CYBERCOM, which we established just last year to protect Americans from the most advanced cyber threats and also to create very, very severe and powerful offensive threats, should we need them.
The dangers to our country constantly evolve, and so must we. Now, those who wish to harm the United States to -- seek to challenge us in the ultimate high ground of space. It's going to be a whole different ballgame. Our adversaries are weaponizing Earth’s orbits with new technology targeting American satellites that are critical to both battlefield operations and our way of life at home.
Our freedom to operate in space is also essential to detecting and destroying any missile launched against the United States. So, just as we have recognized land, air, sea, and cyber as vital warfighting domains, we will now treat space as an independent region overseen by a new unified geographic combatant command.
The establishment of the 11th Combatant Command is a landmark moment. This is a landmark day -- one that recognizes the centrality of space to America’s national security and defense. Under General Raymond’s leadership, SPACECOM will boldly deter aggression and outpace America’s rivals, by far. For 35 years, General Raymond has led and commanded space operations at every level in the U.S. Air Force.
Mollie, I hope you're very proud of him. I'll bet you are. I am, too. He's a warrior who has integrated space capabilities to make our military even stronger and to pave the way for a new era of national defense. He's respected by everybody sitting in front of us -- everybody in the military and everybody that knows him.
SPACECOM will soon be followed, very importantly, by the establishment of the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces. And that's really something, when you think about it. The Space Force will organize, train, and equip warriors to support SPACECOM’s mission. With today’s action, we open another great chapter in the extraordinary history of the United States military.
SPACECOM will ensure that America’s dominance in space is never questioned and never threatened, because we know the best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for victory. From our nation’s first days, America’s military blazed the trails and crossed the frontiers that secured our nation’s future.
No adversary on Earth will ever match the awesome courage, skill, and might of American Armed Forces. Today, we salute the heroic men and women who will serve in SPACECOM and keep America’s horizons forever bright and forever free. We have budgets, since we came into the administration, since the election of 2016 -- since January 20th, of 2017, we have done things with the military that few people would have thought possible.
Budgets of $700 billion, $716 billion, and now $738 billion. Nobody would have thought that that was possible, but we had them approved by Republicans and Democrats. And that money is now building the most advanced equipment anywhere one Earth -- equipment that nobody even could have conceived of, even two years ago.
It's very necessary. And hopefully we'll never have to use it. I would now like to ask Secretary Esper to sign documents formally establishing the United States Space Command. Thank you. Mr. Secretary.
That's a big one. Thank you very much. I'd now like to like to now invite Chief Master Sergeant Roger Towberman to the stage to unfurl the flag of the United States Space Command. Thank you very much.

Theodore Roosevelt,United States of America,1905-03-04 00:00:00,"My fellow-citizens, no people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours, and this is said reverently, in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength, but with gratitude to the Giver of Good who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of well-being and of happiness. To us as a people it has been granted to lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent. We are the heirs of the ages, and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are exacted by the dead hand of a bygone civilization. We have not been obliged to fight for our existence against any alien race; and yet our life has called for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away. Under such conditions it would be our own fault if we failed; and the success which we have had in the past, the success which we confidently believe the future will bring, should cause in us no feeling of vainglory, but rather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us; a full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours; and a fixed determination to show that under a free government a mighty people can thrive best, alike as regards the things of the body and the things of the soul.
Much has been given us, and much will rightfully be expected from us. We have duties to others and duties to ourselves; and we can shirk neither. We have become a great nation, forced by the fact of its greatness into relations with the other nations of the earth, and we must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities. Toward all other nations, large and small, our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friendship. We must show not only in our words, but in our deeds, that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their rights. But justice and generosity in a nation, as in an individual, count most when shown not by the weak but by the strong. While ever careful to refrain from wrongdoing others, we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged ourselves. We wish peace, but we wish the peace of justice, the peace of righteousness. We wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid. No weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us, and no strong power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression.
Our relations with the other powers of the world are important; but still more important are our relations among ourselves. Such growth in wealth, in population, and in power as this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that rises to greatness. Power invariably means both responsibility and danger. Our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown. We now face other perils, the very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee. Modern life is both complex and intense, and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being. Never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a Democratic republic. The conditions which have told for our marvelous material well-being, which have developed to a very high degree our energy, self-reliance, and individual initiative, have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial centers. Upon the success of our experiment much depends, not only as regards our own welfare, but as regards the welfare of mankind. If we fail, the cause of free self-government throughout the world will rock to its foundations, and therefore our responsibility is heavy, to ourselves, to the world as it is to-day, and to the generations yet unborn. There is no good reason why we should fear the future, but there is every reason why we should face it seriously, neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending, unflinching purpose to solve them aright.
Yet, after all, though the problems are new, though the tasks set before us differ from the tasks set before our fathers who founded and preserved this Republic, the spirit in which these tasks must be undertaken and these problems faced, if our duty is to be well done, remains essentially unchanged. We know that self-government is difficult. We know that no people needs such high traits of character as that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely expressed will of the freemen who compose it. But we have faith that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men of the mighty past. They did their work, they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy. We in our turn have an assured confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and our children's children. To do so we must show, not merely in great crises, but in the everyday affairs of life, the qualities of practical intelligence, of courage, of hardihood, and endurance, and above all the power of devotion to a lofty ideal, which made great the men who founded this Republic in the days of Washington, which made great the men who preserved this Republic in the days of Abraham Lincoln.

Peter Wilson,United Kingdom,2015-11-25,"I am not going to thank you for applauding for me because I haven’t spoken yet, but I would join in your applause for the statements that we have heard today because I do particularly want to thank the President for holding this debate, but also to all of you, the Secretary-General, the UN Women’s Executive Director Ms Mlambo-ngcuka, High Commissioner Pillay, and Ms Balipou, for their valuable briefings. I think its right that you have given them applause. I would also like to thank everybody who’s come to participate in and to bear witness to this debate today. For those of you who can’t see, because this will also be recorded on the cameras, this chamber is full and your presence adds weight to what we’ve decided and to what we will discuss in this chamber throughout the day.
So Mr President, I do want to welcome the adoption today of the resolution on Women and Peace and Security. This resolution reiterates the central role for women in resolving conflict and helping to build sustainable peace. I want in particular to highlight three aspects of the resolution.
First of all, it places Women, Peace and Security front and centre in the Council’s work. The Secretary-General has outlined what that means for the Council and his own personal commitment to this, but it also means, in a very practical sense, that the Council will now receive more regular briefings and more updates from UN bodies and officials on this subject. That means that it is central to our work. Secondly, the Resolution highlights the need for women’s participation in areas affected by conflict. We’ve asked that Special-Representatives and Special-Envoys in all UN Missions regularly to consult Women’s organisations from early on in their deployment. Their voices must be heard and needs taken into account in all conflict resolution and peace-building processes. Third, the Resolution makes clear the Council’s commitment to a meaningful review of the implementation of this agenda in 2015 as the Secretary-General emphasised in his remarks earlier. This review must be based on clear data and we have therefore requested the Secretary-General to commission a global study on the remaining gaps and challenges.
I welcome the constructive work of all Council members on this resolution and hope that we will continue to work in a productive manner as we move towards the 2015 review.
Mr President, I now turn to the theme of this debate – transitional justice and the rule of law.
Throughout the world security and justice systems fail women time and time again. In conflict and post-conflict settings when institutions break down and violence is rampant, existing injustices are often exacerbated.
However, transitions out of conflict provide opportunities to strengthen women’s leadership, empowerment and rights whilst restoring the rule of law and governance systems.
Rebuilding justice and the rule of law is fundamental to protecting women’s equal rights and creating a more stable, secure and just society.
As the Secretary-General has highlighted, women’s representation in the justice sector is crucial and helps increase the reporting of crimes. Barriers must be removed so that women can access justice in formal and traditional settings. For example, we have seen success through the use of mobile courts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and paralegal support groups in Nepal. In addition, the most basic needs must be provided for, from access to safe public transportation to the effective delivery of services like water and electricity, as Ms Balipou so eloquently highlighted in her statement earlier.
The United Kingdom has established a Team of Experts on the Rule of Law. This Team which includes lawyers, gender advisors and experts in the protection of victims and witnesses provides training and mentoring to national authorities to help them develop appropriate laws and build their capabilities. The teams also worked on the frontline with grassroots organisations, local peace builders and human rights defenders. They have already been deployed to the Syrian borders, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Libya, Mali and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Mr President, the United Kingdom welcomes the report of the Secretary General and the important recommendations that it makes. We welcome the ongoing work of UN Women. And we recognise the continuing challenges in implementing this agenda lie beyond the topic of today’s debate. In conflict settings worldwide women continue to be seen merely victims of violence rather than leaders of change, as those to be protected rather than respected and included as equal participants in all decision making processes. As Ms Mlambo-ngcuka said, women are central to leadership. Since the end of the Cold War, women have represented only 4 percent of signatories to peace agreements, less than 3 percent of mediators of peace talks, and less than 10 percent of anyone sitting at the table to negotiate on behalf of a party to conflict. Excluding 50% of society will never lead to stable and lasting peace. Peace can only be achieved with women’s active participation and leadership.
The United Kingdom welcomes the Council’s consultation with women’s organisations during its trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo this month. We also commend the recent work of Mary Robinson, I agree with the Secretary-General that was an excellent appointment, on engaging with women’s civil society in the Great Lakes region, and hope others will follow by example.
Mr President, we have two years before the Council’s high level review in 2015 to demonstrate our collective commitment to this agenda. Ahead of this, let us all – Member States, the Council, and UN entities – invigorate our efforts and give this agenda the attention it deserves and take the action that we have committed to here today.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-09-02,". Thank you very much, everybody. It's great to be with you. I'm going to a battleship. Did you ever hear of a battleship... The North Carolina, right? So we're going to say hello to some of our incredible veterans, and it's really... Boy, this is a lot of people.
I thought there might be a few people. So we won a big race in 2016 and they say the enthusiasm right now is far greater than even 2016. I have to say this: this is the most important election in the history of our country. I really believe that. Because we're running against people that have got some big issues.
They've got some big, big problems. They're stone-cold crazy, and we have to keep our country. As you know, Joe Biden, he doesn't have a clue. We can't let it happen to our country. We're making strides. You know, the stock market's hitting another high. We have to do what we're doing.
The country's coming back really strongly. I'm going to say hello to this group, then I'm going to say hello to that group, and then I'll say a few words in the middle, okay? Thank you. I'll be right there. Yeah, if you could just hold that for -- just hold it.

Baroness Kramer,United Kingdom,2015-11-30,"Thank you Charlie, and good morning ladies and gentlemen.
It’s a great pleasure to be here in my new capacity as Minister of State for Transport.
I might be new to the department, but my interest in transport goes back a long way.
I ran a business advising on infrastructure finance in central and eastern Europe.
I was on the board of Transport for London.
And I was Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary – under the leadership of Sir Menzies Campbell.
I must say I was hugely impressed.
So impressed, in fact, that I’m trying to persuade E-Car to let me drive one.
The environmental case for going electric is widely understood, but I wasn’t expecting the vehicles to be as sophisticated and refined as they are – both in their design and in the quality of their ride.
Clearly the products are right.
And sales are growing.
But over the next few years, we have to make them even more commercially attractive to potential customers.
So it’s inspiring to see a business like E-Car Club, which was only set up a couple of years ago, doing so much to promote ultra low emission vehicles.
While government is providing significant funding to develop the technology, expand the infrastructure, and reduce the cost of electric vehicles to buyers, ultimately building the market requires initiative and entrepreneurial flair at a local level.
And that’s precisely what E-Car Club and HARCA are doing here.
This type of collaboration, between the car club, local authority and community association will be instrumental in growing the market and changing the way we travel.
Pay-as-you-go car clubs don’t just help us improve air quality, reduce traffic noise and cut carbon.
They also give Londoners more choice about the journeys they take.
Reduce the cost of transport to individuals and businesses.
And promote more efficient use of cars.
We are absolutely committed as a government to speeding up the development of electric and other ultra low carbon vehicles – and supporting the growing market.
As some of you may be aware, last month we published our ultra low emission vehicle strategy – called ‘Driving the future today’.
Taking on board the views of stakeholders, it sets out a structured plan to transform sales of ultra low emission vehicles. Our long-term vision is for all cars and vans on our roads to be ultra low emission vehicles by 2050.
We will continue to support the early market, through:
– plug in grants which currently reduce the upfront cost by up to £5000 per car or £8000 per van
– tax concessions
– and grants for installing charging infrastructure
We are also working to install more publicly accessible chargers in key locations like car parks at train stations and rapid chargers at motorway services.
We have an unwavering, long term commitment to decarbonising road transport.
Not just to tackle climate change.
But also to make the UK a global leader in green vehicle technologies and engineering.
The government’s focus will remain consistent and technologically neutral.
And we welcome any innovative thinking that helps us achieve that goal.
We will work to resolve any market failures or barriers to growth.
In Europe we will continue to negotiate on the basis that regulations on reducing CO₂ from cars are ambitious but realistic.
And we will keep on listening to industry and ensure that its concerns are taken on board when formulating policy.
The industry’s role is crucial – and will be even more crucial in the future as our investment in green vehicles grows.
In the 2013 Spending Round, the Chancellor announced that £500 million would be made available to develop the ULEV market between 2015 and 2020.
This is a world leading commitment that gives certainty to the market.
But we need the industry to help us deploy it in the most beneficial way.
So we will shortly be launching a call for evidence to draw in a wide range of ideas to help us design the next phase of our ULEV programme.
This is your opportunity to tell us how we can best support sustainable market growth in this sector.
How best we can help UK technology businesses.
And how best these changes can boost economic growth.
We will retain incentives to help motorists with the upfront cost of buying ULEVs.
And of course we will continue to invest to get the necessary infrastructure in place.
I think we all appreciate that the decarbonisation of road transport presents us with a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Like you, I am determined that we seize that opportunity.
And I look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead to do just that.
Thank you.
",2013 Speech on Low Carbon Vehicles,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/baroness-kramer-2013-speech-on-low-carbon-vehicles/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-11-10,"What an honor it is to be here in Vietnam -- in the very heart of the Indo-Pacific -- to address the people and business leaders of this region.
This has already been a remarkable week for the United States in this wonderful part of the world. Starting from Hawaii, Melania and I traveled to Japan, South Korea, and China, and now to Vietnam, to be here with all of you today.
Before we begin, I want to address all those affected by Typhoon Damrey. Americans are praying for you and for your recovery in the months ahead. Our hearts are united with the Vietnamese people suffering in the aftermath of this terrible storm.
This trip comes at an exciting time for America. A new optimism has swept all across our country. Economic growth has reached 3.2 percent, and going higher. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 17 years. The stock market is at an all-time high. And the whole world is lifted by America's renewal.
Everywhere I've traveled on this journey, I've had the pleasure of sharing the good news from America. But even more, I've had the honor of sharing our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific -- a place where sovereign and independent nations, with diverse cultures and many different dreams, can all prosper side-by-side, and thrive in freedom and in peace.
I am so thrilled to be here today at APEC, because this organization was founded to help achieve that very purpose. America stands as a proud member of the community of nations who make a home on the Pacific. We have been an active partner in this region since we first won independence ourselves.
In 1784, the first American ship sailed to China from the newly independent United States. It went loaded with goods to sell in Asia, and it came back full of porcelain and tea. Our first president, George Washington himself, owned a set of tableware from that ship.
In 1804, Thomas Jefferson sent the explorers, Lewis and Clark, on an expedition to our Pacific Coast. They were the first of the millions of Americans who ventured west to live out America's manifest destiny across our vast continent.
. That initial naval presence soon grew into a squadron, and then a fleet, to guarantee freedom of navigation for the growing number of ships, braving the high seas to reach markets in the Philippines, Singapore, and in India.
In 1818, we began our relationship with the Kingdom of Thailand, and 15 years later our two countries signed a treaty of friendship and commerce -- our first with an Asian nation.
In the next century, when imperialist powers threatened this region, the United States pushed back at great cost to ourselves. We understood that security and prosperity depended on it.
We have been friends, partners, and allies in the Indo-Pacific for a long, long time, and we will be friends, partners, and allies for a long time to come.
As old friends in the region, no one has been more delighted than America to witness, to help, and to share in the extraordinary progress you have made over the last half-century.
What the countries and economies represented here today have built in this part of the world is nothing short of miraculous. The story of this region in recent decades is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.
Few would have imagined just a generation ago that leaders of these nations would come together here in Da Nang to deepen our friendships, expand our partnerships, and celebrate the amazing achievements of our people.
This city was once home to an American military base, in a country where many Americans and Vietnamese lost their lives in a very bloody war.
Today, we are no longer enemies; we are friends. And this port city is bustling with ships from around the world. Engineering marvels, like the Dragon Bridge, welcome the millions who come to visit Da Nang's stunning beaches, shining lights, and ancient charms.
In the early 1990s, nearly half of Vietnam survived on just a few dollars a day, and one in four did not have any electricity. Today, an opening Vietnamese economy is one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth. It has already increased more than 30 times over, and the Vietnamese students rank among the best students in the world.
This is the same story of incredible transformation that we have seen across the region. Indonesians for decades have been building domestic and democratic institutions to govern their vast chain of more than 13,000 islands. Since the 1990s, Indonesia's people have lifted themselves from poverty to become one of the fastest-growing nations of the G20. Today, it is the third-largest democracy on Earth.
The Philippines has emerged as a proud nation of strong and devout families. For 11 consecutive years, the World Economic Forum has ranked the Philippines first among Asian countries in closing the gender gap and embracing women leaders in business and in politics.
The Kingdom of Thailand has become an upper middle-income country in less than a generation. Its majestic capital of Bangkok is now the most visited city on Earth. And that is very impressive. Not too many people here are from Thailand.
Malaysia has rapidly developed through recent decades, and it is now ranked as one of the best places in the world to do business.
As I recently observed in South Korea, the people of that Republic took a poor country ravaged by war, and in just a few decades turned it into one of the wealthiest democracies on Earth. Today, South Koreans enjoy higher incomes than the citizens of many European Union countries. It was great spending time with President Moon.
Everyone knows of China's impressive achievements over the past several decades. During this period -- and it was a period of great market reforms -- large parts of China experienced rapid economic growth, jobs boomed, and more than 800 million citizens rose out of poverty. I just left China this morning and had a really productive meeting and a wonderful time with our gracious host, President Xi.
And, as I saw on my first stop of this trip, in Japan we see a dynamic democracy in a land of industrial, technological, and cultural wonders. In fewer than 60 years, that island nation has produced 24 Nobel Prize winners for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and the promotion of peace.
In the broader region, countries outside of APEC are also making great strides in this new chapter for the Indo-Pacific.
India is celebrating the 70th anniversary of its independence. It is a sovereign democracy, as well as -- think of this -- over 1 billion people. It's the largest democracy in the world.
Since India opened its economy, it has achieved astounding growth and a new world of opportunity for its expanding middle class. And Prime Minister Modi has been working to bring that vast country, and all of its people, together as one. And he is working at it very, very successfully, indeed.
As we can see, in more and more places throughout this region, citizens of sovereign and independent nations have taken greater control of their destinies and unlocked the potential of their people.
They've pursued visions of justice and accountability, promoted private property and the rule of law, and embraced systems that value hard work and individual enterprise.
They built businesses, they built cities, they built entire countries from the ground up. Many of you in this room have taken part in these great, uplifting national projects of building. They have been your projects from inception to completion, from dreams to reality.
With your help, this entire region has emerged -- and it is still emerging -- as a beautiful constellation of nations, each its own bright star, satellites to none -- and each one, a people, a culture, a way of life, and a home.
Those of you who have lived through these transformations understand better than anyone the value of what you have achieved. You also understand that your home is your legacy, and you must always protect it.
In the process of your economic development, you've sought commerce and trade with other nations, and forged partnerships based on mutual respect and directed toward mutual gain.
Today, I am here to offer a renewed partnership with America to work together to strengthen the bonds of friendship and commerce between all of the nations of the Indo-Pacific, and together, to promote our prosperity and security.
At the core of this partnership, we seek robust trade relationships rooted in the principles of fairness and reciprocity. When the United States enters into a trading relationship with other countries or other peoples, we will, from now on, expect that our partners will faithfully follow the rules just like we do. We expect that markets will be open to an equal degree on both sides, and that private industry, not government planners, will direct investment.
Unfortunately, for too long and in too many places, the opposite has happened. For many years, the United States systematically opened our economy with few conditions. We lowered or ended tariffs, reduced trade barriers, and allowed foreign goods to flow freely into our country.
But while we lowered market barriers, other countries didn't open their markets to us.
. They must have been one of the beneficiaries.
Countries were embraced by the World Trade Organization, even if they did not abide by its stated principles. Simply put, we have not been treated fairly by the World Trade Organization. Organizations like the WTO can only function properly when all members follow the rules and respect the sovereign rights of every member. We cannot achieve open markets if we do not ensure fair market access. In the end, unfair trade undermines us all.
The United States promoted private enterprise, innovation, and industry. Other countries used government-run industrial planning and state-owned enterprises.
We adhered to WTO principles on protecting intellectual property and ensuring fair and equal market access. They engaged in product dumping, subsidized goods, currency manipulation, and predatory industrial policies.
They ignored the rules to gain advantage over those who followed the rules, causing enormous distortions in commerce and threatening the foundations of international trade itself.
Such practices, along with our collective failure to respond to them, hurt many people in our country and also in other countries. Jobs, factories, and industries were stripped out of the United States and out of many countries in addition. And many opportunities for mutually beneficial investments were lost because people could not trust the system.
We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses, and we will not tolerate them. Despite years of broken promises, we were told that someday soon everyone would behave fairly and responsibly. People in America and throughout the Indo-Pacific region have waited for that day to come. But it never has, and that is why I am here today -- to speak frankly about our challenges and work toward a brighter future for all of us.
I recently had an excellent trip to China, where I spoke openly and directly with President Xi about China's unfair trade practices and the enormous trade deficits they have produced with the United States. I expressed our strong desire to work with China to achieve a trading relationship that is conducted on a truly fair and equal basis.
The current trade imbalance is not acceptable. I do not blame China or any other country, of which there are many, for taking advantage of the United States on trade. If their representatives are able to get away with it, they are just doing their jobs. I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it. They did not, but I will.
From this day forward, we will compete on a fair and equal basis. We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore. I am always going to put America first the same way that I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first.
The United States is prepared to work with each of the leaders in this room today to achieve mutually beneficial commerce that is in the interest of both your countries and mine. That is the message I am here to deliver.
I will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade. What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty, and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible.
Instead, we will deal on a basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit. We will respect your independence and your sovereignty. We want you to be strong, prosperous, and self-reliant, rooted in your history, and branching out toward the future. That is how we will thrive and grow together, in partnerships of real and lasting value.
But for this -- and I call it the Indo-Pacific dream -- if it's going to be realized, we must ensure that all play by the rules, which they do not right now. Those who do will be our closest economic partners. Those who do not can be certain that the United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating, or economic aggression. Those days are over.
We will no longer tolerate the audacious theft of intellectual property. We will confront the destructive practices of forcing businesses to surrender their technology to the state, and forcing them into joint ventures in exchange for market access.
We will address the massive subsidizing of industries through colossal state-owned enterprises that put private competitors out of business -- happening all the time.
We will not remain silent as American companies are targeted by state-affiliated actors for economic gain, whether through cyberattacks, corporate espionage, or other anti-competitive practices. We will encourage all nations to speak out loudly when the principles of fairness and reciprocity are violated.
We know it is in America's interests to have partners throughout this region that are thriving, prosperous, and dependent on no one. We will not make decisions for the purpose of power or patronage. We will never ask our partners to surrender their sovereignty, privacy, and intellectual property, or to limit contracts to state-owned suppliers.
We will find opportunities for our private sector to work with yours and to create jobs and wealth for us all. We seek strong partners, not weak partners. We seek strong neighbors, not weak neighbors. Above all, we seek friendship, and we don't dream of domination.
For this reason, we are also refocusing our existing development efforts. We are calling on the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to direct their efforts toward high-quality infrastructure investment that promotes economic growth.
The United States will also do its part. We are also committed to reforming our development finance institutions so that they better incentivize private sector investment in your economies, and provide strong alternatives to state-directed initiatives that come with many strings attached.
The United States has been reminded time and time again in recent years that economic security is not merely related to national security. Economic security is national security.
We also know that we will not have lasting prosperity if we do not confront grave threats to security, sovereignty, and stability facing our world today.
Earlier this week, I addressed the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea and urged every responsible nation to stand united in declaring that every single step the North Korean regime takes toward more weapons is a step it takes into greater and greater danger. The future of this region and its beautiful people must not be held hostage to a dictator's twisted fantasies of violent conquest and nuclear blackmail.
We must also deal decisively with other threats to our security and the future of our children, such as criminal cartels, human smuggling, drugs, corruption, cybercrime, and territorial expansion. As I have said many times before: All civilized people must come together to drive out terrorists and extremists from our societies, stripping them of funding, territory, and ideological support. We must stop radical Islamic terrorism.
So let us work together for a peaceful, prosperous, and free Indo-Pacific. I am confident that, together, every problem we have spoken about today can be solved and every challenge we face can be overcome.
If we succeed in this effort, if we seize the opportunities before us and ground our partnerships firmly in the interests of our own people, then together we will achieve everything we dream for our nations and for our children.
We will be blessed with a world of strong, sovereign, and independent nations, thriving in peace and commerce with others. They will be places where we can build our homes and where families, businesses, and people can flourish and grow.
If we do this, will we look at the globe half a century from now, and we will marvel at the beautiful constellation of nations -- each different, each unique, and each shining brightly and proudly throughout this region of the world. And just as when we look at the stars in the night sky, the distance of time will make most of the challenges we have and that we spoke of today seem very, very small.
What will not seem small -- what is not small -- will be the big choices that all of our nations will have to make to keep their stars glowing very, very brightly.
In America, like every nation that has won and defended its sovereignty, we understand that we have nothing so precious as our birthright, our treasured independence, and our freedom.
That knowledge has guided us throughout American history. It has inspired us to sacrifice and innovate. And it is why today, hundreds of years after our victory in the American Revolution, we still remember the words of an American founder and our second President of the United States, John Adams.
As an old man, just before his death, this great patriot was asked to offer his thoughts on the 50th anniversary of glorious American freedom. He replied with the words: independence forever.
It's a sentiment that burns in the heart of every patriot and every nation. Our hosts here in Vietnam have known this sentiment not just for 200 years, but for nearly 2,000 years. It was then that, for the first time, the people of Vietnam stood for your independence and your pride.
. They remind us of who we are and what we are called to do.
Together, we have it in our power to lift our people and our world to new heights -- heights that have never been attained,
So let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. Let us choose wealth and freedom over poverty and servitude. Let us choose a free and open Indo-Pacific.
. But in all of the world, there is no place like home.
And so, for family, for country, for freedom, for history, and for the glory of God, protect your home, defend your home, and love your home today and for all time.
Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless the Pacific region. And God Bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
",Speech: Donald Trump Addresses APEC CEO Summit,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-apec-ceo-summit-november-10-2017
Sir John Major,United Kingdom,2018-03-03,"I would like to express my thanks to the Creative Industries Federation, Somerset House Trust, and Tech London Advocates for the opportunity to speak here today.
Brexit matters to our creative industries. They express our culture and values – but give so much more.
Nearly 10% of our national workforce is in creative industries. They are often the young – and overwhelmingly in small units up and down the UK.
Job growth outpaces every other part of industry – especially in the Midlands and Yorkshire.
Their exports total over £35 billion a year, but their added value to our country – both economically and socially – is incalculable … and far beyond cash.
Our decision to leave the EU faces the creative industries with a variety of threats that could harm their future, both in financial and human terms.
So I am delighted to be their guest here this afternoon – to talk of Brexit.
********
For years, the European debate has been dominated by the fringes of opinion – by strong supporters of Europe or convinced opponents. But, as we approach Brexit, the voice of middle opinion mustn’t be overlooked.
I am neither a Europhile nor a Eurosceptic. As Prime Minister, I said “No” to federal integration, “No” to the Euro Currency, and “No” to Schengen – which introduced free movement of people within the European Union but without proper control of external borders.
But I am a realist. I believe that to risk losing our trade advantages with the colossal market on our doorstep is to inflict economic self-harm on the British people.
Of course, the “will of the people” can’t be ignored, but Parliament has a duty also to consider the “wellbeing of the people”.
No-one voted for higher prices and poorer public services, but that is what they may get. The emerging evidence suggests Brexit will hurt most those who have least. Neither Parliament nor Government wish to see that.
The “will of the people” – so often summoned up when sound argument is absent – was supported by only 37% of the electorate. 63% voted either in favour of membership – or did not vote at all.
There was a majority for Brexit, but there was no overwhelming mandate to ignore the reservations of 16 million voters, who believe it will be a harmful change of direction for our country.
Brexit has been the most divisive issue of my lifetime. It has divided not only the four nations of our UK, but regions within them. It has divided political parties; political colleagues; families; friends – and the young from the old.
We have to heal those divisions. They have been made worse by the character of the Brexit debate with its intolerance, its bullying, and its name-calling. I welcome rigorous debate – but there must be respect for differing views that are honestly held.
In this debate there are no “remoaners”, no “mutineers”, no “enemies of the people” – just voices setting out what they believe is right for our country.
In recent weeks, the idea has gained ground that Brexit won’t be too bad; that we will all get through it; that we’re doing better than expected – and all will be well.
Of course we will get through it: life as we know it won’t come to an end. We are too resourceful and talented a nation for that. But our nation is owed a frank assessment of what leaving Europe may mean – for now and the future.
I fear we will be weaker and less prosperous – as a country and as individuals. And – although it grieves me to admit it – our divorce from Europe will diminish our international stature. Indeed, it already has.
As a result, we are already becoming a lesser actor. No-one – Leaver or Remainer – can welcome that.
We are all urged to be “patriotic” and get behind Brexit. But it is precisely because I am patriotic that I oppose it.
I want my Country to be influential, not isolated; committed, not cut-off; a leading participant, not a bystander.
I want us to be richer, not poorer. Yet every serious international body, including the IMF, the OECD, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research – as well as Nobel prize-winners – forecast we will be poorer outside the EU.
Such forecasts could be wrong, but to dismiss them out of hand is reckless.
Our own Government has assessed our post-Brexit position upon three separate criteria: that we stay in the Single Market; or reach a trade deal with Europe; or fail to do so.
Each option shows us to be worse off: and disastrously so with no trade deal at all. And the poorest regions will be hurt the most.
If, as negotiations proceed, this analysis appears to be correct, that cannot be brushed aside. I know of no precedent for any Government enacting a policy that will make both our country and our people poorer. Once that is apparent, the Government must change course.
Meanwhile, we are yet again told all will be well. Certainly, the recent fall in the value of Sterling has temporarily boosted our exports. The strength of the world economy may even increase our forecast growth this year.
But this sweet spot is artificial. It won’t last. Prosperity isn’t built on devaluation of the currency. More exports on the back of other countries’ economic growth is not a secure position.
The UK has been at the very top of European growth.
We are now the laggard at the bottom. We have become the slowest of the world’s big economies, even before we surrender the familiar advantages of the Single Market.
Our negotiations, so far, have not always been sure-footed. Some agreements have been reached but, in many areas, only because the UK has given ground.
Our determination to negotiate the divorce bill and a new trade deal at the same time was going to be “the fight of the summer” – but instead became an immediate British retreat.
There was to be a “points based” immigration system. There isn’t, and there won’t be.
We were to become the “Singapore of the North”. No more: we have retreated from a policy of lower taxes and de-regulation.
No transition period was going to be needed. But we have now asked for one – during which we will accept new EU rules, ECJ jurisdiction, and free movement of people.
I don’t say this to be critical.
I do so to illustrate that unrealistic aspirations are usually followed by retreat.
That is a lesson for the negotiations to come.
They will be the most difficult any Government has faced. Our aims have to be realistic. I am not sure they yet are.
We simply cannot move forward with leaving the EU, the Single Market, the Customs Union and the ECJ, whilst at the same time expecting à la carte, beneficial-to-Britain, bespoke entrance to the European market. It is just not credible.
A willingness to compromise is essential. If either side – the UK or the EU – is too inflexible, too unbending, too wedded to what they won’t do – then the negotiations will fail.
The very essence of negotiation involves both “give” and “take”. But there are always “red lines” that neither side wishes to cross. In successful negotiations those “red lines” are traded for concessions.
If our “red lines” are held to be inviolable, the likelihood of no deal – or a poor deal – increases. Every time we close off options prematurely, this encourages the EU to do the same – and that is not in our British interest.
A good Brexit – for Britain – will protect our trade advantages, and enable us to:
– continue to sell our goods and services without disruption;
– import and export food without barriers and extra cost; staff our hospitals, universities and businesses with the skills we need – where we most need them;
– be part of the cutting edge of European research, in which British brains and skills lead the way;
– continue with the over 40 FTAs we have with countries only as a result of our membership of the EU.
A bad Brexit – for Britain – will surrender these, and other, advantages.
For the moment, our self-imposed “red lines” have boxed the Government into a corner.
They are so tilted to ultra Brexit opinion, even the Cabinet cannot agree them – and a majority in both Houses of Parliament oppose them. If maintained in full, it will be impossible to reach a favourable trade outcome.
Alarmed at the negotiations so far, the financial sector, businesses, and our academic institutions, are pleading for commonsense policy to serve the national interest and now – fearful they may not get it – are making their own preparations for the future.
Japanese car-makers warn they could close operations in Britain unless we maintain free access to the EU. That would be heart-breaking for many people in Sunderland or Swindon or South Wales.
This isn’t “Project Fear” revisited, it is “Project Know Your History”.
Any doubters should consult the former employees of factories, now closed, in Bridgend, Port Talbot and Newport, where jobs were lost and families suffered.
In 1991, employment by Japanese firms in Wales was about 17,000 people: today, it is 2,000. If free access to Europe is lost – that scale of impact, across the UK, could lose 125,000 Japanese jobs.
Over many years, the Conservative Party has understood the concerns of business. Not over Brexit, it seems.
Across the United Kingdom – businesses are expressing their wish to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union. But “No”, say the Government’s “red lines”.
Businesses wish to have the freedom to employ foreign skills. “No”, say the Government’s “red lines”.
Business and academia wish to welcome foreign students to our universities and – as they rise to influence in their own countries – we then have willing partners in politics and business for decades to come. “No”, say the Government’s “red lines”.
This is not only grand folly. It’s also bad politics.
The national interest must always be above the Party interest, but my Party should beware. It is only fear of Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell that prevents a haemorrhage of business support.
Without the comprehensive trade deal the Prime Minister seeks, we risk economic divorce from the EU, and the chill embrace of a “hard” Brexit with WTO rules.
Leading Brexit supporters believe there is nothing to fear from losing our special access to the Single Market.
But that is profoundly wrong. Swapping the Single Market for WTO rules
would mean our exports facing the EU external tariff, as well as hidden nontariff barriers that could be adjusted to our disadvantage at any time.
A Minister has speculated we might face tariffs of 3%. Not so.
Even if a successful negotiation were to halve these tariffs, our exports would still be much more expensive to sell – and this would apply far beyond agriculture and the motor industry.
And if, in retaliation, the UK were to impose tariffs on imports, this would result in higher prices for the British consumer.
If we and the EU agreed to impose nil tariffs – as some have speculated – WTO rules mean we would both have to offer nil tariffs to all countries. That isn’t going to happen.
This is all very complex. But it is crucial. And none of it has yet been properly explained to the British people.
There have been attempts to reassure business by claiming that other nations trade with the EU on purely WTO terms. That statement is simply wrong.
China, the US and Japan all have side agreements with Europe on standards, customs co-operation, mutual recognition and investment. These economic giants did so to protect their own trade even though none of them is exposed as we are – still half our entire exports go to Europe.
Ultra Brexit opinion is impatient to be free of European relationships; to become – in their words – a “global player”, “sovereign”, “in control”. I believe they are deceiving themselves and, as a result, they are misleading the British people.
Before the modern world took shape – their ambition would have been credible. But the world has changed, the global market has taken root, and – if we are to care for the people of our nation – philosophical fantasies must give way to national self-interest. We cannot prepare for tomorrow by living in the world of yesterday.
I don’t doubt the convictions of those who long for the seductive ambition of British exceptionalism. But these sentiments are out-of-date and, in today’s world, wrong.
It is not my purpose to stir controversy, but the truth must be spoken. The ultra Brexiteers have been mistaken – wrong – in nearly all they have said or promised to the British people.
The promises of more hospitals, more schools, lower taxes, more money for transport were electioneering fantasy. The £350 million a week for the NHS was a ridiculous phantom: the reality is if our economy weakens – as is forecast – there will not only be less money for the NHS, but for all our public services.
We were told that nobody was threatening our place in the Single Market. That tune has changed.
We were told that a trade deal with the EU would be easy to get. Wrong again: it was never going to be easy, and we are still not sure what outcome will be achieved.
We were told “Europe can whistle for their money” and we would not pay a penny in exit costs. Wrong again. Europe didn’t even have to purse her lips before we agreed to pay £40 billion to meet legitimate liabilities.
I could go on.”.
People should pause and reflect: if the Brexit leaders were wrong in what they said so enthusiastically before – are they not likely to be wrong in what they say now?
The Prime Minister is seeking a “frictionless” border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. She is absolutely right to do so. This is a promise that must be honoured, and I wish her well. But, so far, this has not materialised – nor, I fear, will it – unless we stay in “a” or “the” Customs Union.
Those of us who warned of the risks Brexit would bring to the still fragile Peace Process were told at the time that we “didn’t understand Irish politics”. But it seems we understood it better than our critics. We need a policy to protect the Good Friday Agreement – and we need one urgently. And it is our responsibility to find one – not the European Union.
Although the referendum was advisory only, the result gave the Government the obligation to negotiate a Brexit. But not any Brexit; not at all costs; and certainly not on any terms. The true remit can only be to agree a Brexit that honours the promises made in the referendum.
But, so far, the promises have not been met and, probably, cannot be met.
Many electors know they were misled: many more are beginning to realise it.
So, the electorate has every right to reconsider their decision.
Meanwhile, our options become ever narrower.
We have ruled out full membership. Ruled out the Single Market and Customs Union. Ruled out joining the European Economic Area. Dismissed talk of joining EFTA.
A Norway deal won’t do. Nor will a Swiss deal. Nor a Ukraine deal; a Turkey deal; or a South Korea deal. No, to them all, say the Government’s “red lines”.
So, little is left, except for “cherry picking” – which the EU rejects. Or a comprehensive deal – which will be very hard, if not impossible, to get. So compromise it must be – or no deal at all.
It is now widely accepted that “no deal” would be the worst possible outcome.
Or an enhanced “Canada deal” – and it would need to be enhanced a very great deal to be attractive. The Canada deal largely concerns goods – whereas the bulk of UK exports are services.
But what we achieve to protect our interests may depend on what we concede: it is, as I say, “give” and “take”. If our “red lines” dissolve, our options enlarge.
Our minimum objective must be that “deep, special and bespoke” trade deal the Prime Minister has talked about.
So, some unpalatable decisions lie ahead – with the cast-iron certainty that the extreme and unbending Brexit lobby will cry “betrayal” at any compromise. But it is Parliament, not a small minority, that must decide our policy.
I spoke earlier of the “divisiveness” of Brexit across our United Kingdom. But, in due time, the debate will end and – when it does – we need the highest possible level of public acceptance for the outcome. It is in no-one’s interest for the bitterness and division to linger on.
I see only one way to achieve this.
It is already agreed that Parliament must pass legislation giving effect to the deal. A “meaningful vote” has been promised. This must be a decisive vote, in which Parliament can accept or reject the final outcome; or send the negotiators back to seek improvements; or order a referendum.
That is what Parliamentary sovereignty means.
But, to minimise divisions in our country – and between and within the political parties – I believe the Government should take a brave and bold decision. They should invite Parliament to accept or reject the final outcome on a free vote.
I know the instinct of every Government is to oppose “free votes”, but the Government should weigh the advantages of having one very carefully. It may be in their interest to do so.
There are some very practical reasons in favour of it.
Brexit is a unique decision. It will affect the lives of the British people for generations to come. If it flops – there will be the most terrible backlash.
If it is whipped through Parliament, when the public are so divided, voters will know who to blame if they end up poorer and weaker. So, both democracy and prudence suggest a free vote.
The deep divisions in our nation are more likely to be healed by a Brexit freely approved by Parliament, than a Brexit forced through Parliament at the behest of a minority of convinced opponents of Europe.
A free vote would better reflect the reality that – for every 17 voters who opted for Brexit – 16 opted to remain in the EU.
But, regardless of whether a free vote is offered, Parliamentarians must decide the issue on the basis of their own conscience. Upon whether, in mature judgement, they really do believe that the outcome of the negotiations is in the best interests of the people they serve.
By 2021, after the likely two-year transition, it will be five years since the 2016 referendum. The electorate will have changed. Some voters will have left us. Many new voters will be enfranchised. Others may have changed their mind.
No-one can truly know what “the will of the people” may then be. So, let Parliament decide. Or put the issue back to the people.
And what is true for the House of Commons must apply to the House of Lords. Peers must ignore any noises off, and be guided by their intellect and their conscience.
I have been a Conservative all my life.
I don’t enjoy being out of step with many in my Party and take no pleasure in speaking out as I am today.
But it’s as necessary to speak truth to the people, as to power.
Leaving Europe is an issue so far-reaching, so permanent, so over-arching that it will have an impact on all our lives – most especially on the young and the future. With only 12 months to go, we need answers, not aspirations.
This is far more than just a Party issue. It’s about the future of our United Kingdom, and everyone who lives in it.
That is what matters. That is why I’m here today.
",2018 Speech on Brexit,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/sir-john-major-2018-speech-on-brexit/
Stephen Byers,United Kingdom,2015-11-08,"Hector, can I say that I am personally delighted, as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to be addressing Congress this afternoon. I am acutely aware that I am the third Secretary of State in as many years to address Congress. It is what the Prime Minister means by labour market flexibility, I think. But I have given your General Secretary an assurance that as this may be my first and last address to Congress, I will be on my best behaviour. John has put me on a very strict vegetarian diet so the bad news for all those journalists is I have got to decline your invitations to a fish supper this evening.
I know that Charles Kennedy has been attending Congress today. I understand that it is the first time he has ever had a non-speaking role in anything that he has done, but I am sure that he will have learnt a lot from conversations and discussions with delegates.
As Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, having held the position now for nine months or so, I have personally welcomed very much the advice, the recommendations and the views that have been put forward by the TUC. That does not mean that I have always been able to agree with the points that have been expressed. There will be times when I have to say “No”; there will be times when I can say “Yes”. But in democracy I believe that is a healthy relationship, not an overly close one that many felt existed under previous Labour Governments.
Now I appreciate that at times decisions that we take in Government will cause tension between us. There will be disagreement and occasionally a feeling of anger and frustration as far as you are concerned. When this happens we need to ensure that we maintain a dialogue between each other. Our actions in Government will always be to put the national interest first. That means that in all we do we will operate on the basis of fairness and not favours.
I hope that I do not put John Monks in a difficult position when I reveal there has been one occasion in my time as Secretary of State when he has written to me with unreserved support for a decision that I have taken and a policy that we have implemented. He did not write that letter though as General Secretary; he wrote it as a long-standing supporter of Manchester United and it was supporting my decision to reject BSkyB’s takeover of Manchester United.
This Government was elected on a policy and an agenda of modernisation and reform, not to be rooted in the past or overwhelmed by the present, but a Government with a clear vision of the future direction of British society and the British economy. That vision and sense of direction is vital as we are witnessing a fundamental shift in our economy and our society. It is driven by globalisation, by knowledge, innovation and technology. It is changing the nature of work and the very workforce itself. The successful economies of the future will excel at generating ideas and exploiting them commercially.
The first industrial revolution, in which we led the world, was based on investment in plant and machinery. We are now living through a new revolution, a new industrial revolution which is knowledge based which means investing in learning, skills and training. In all this, education will be the key.
In response to this rapidly-changing world in which we live, we, as a Government, are doing things differently, and I appreciate that for some this is not easy. But week in and week out we are delivering policies and doing so in a way which will retain and consolidate the support of that historic coalition that gave us a landslide victory in the May 1997 general election.
Let us quickly look at some of our achievements over the last 2 2 years. We restored trade union rights at GCHQ and we have cut corporation tax. We have signed the Social Chapter and we have led the case for reform in Europe. We have begun to invest , 40 billion in our schools and hospitals and we have cut the rate of income tax. We have introduced a national minimum wage and cut the rate of tax for small business to its lowest ever level. Within the month we shall see the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and we have also introduced tough measures to tackle fraud in our benefits system. We have established the New Deal for the young and long-term unemployed. We have also introduced a research and development tax credit for business. We have achieved all of those.
What has been the response of the official Opposition? The Tories still oppose the national minimum wage. They have got a new Trade and Industry Shadow Minister, Alan Duncan. He has described the minimum wage as a cretinous idea. I had a quick look in the dictionary yesterday just to reaffirm in my own mind what a ‘cretin’ was. A cretin is a fool or a stupid person. I think that is a far more accurate description of Alan Duncan than the minimum wage which has directly benefited 2 million working people.
The Tories would scrap the New Deal. They say it has been a failure, but let us look at the facts and not rely on prejudice: 300,000 young people already helped; youth unemployment cut by a half. The Tories regard that as a failure! It should come, of course, as no surprise. When they were in Government they were prepared to see a whole generation of young people the innocent victims of their economic and social policies. This Government will discharge our responsibilities to the young people and the future of our country. The New Deal does that and gives them hope for the future.
The Tories say they do not support the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and would abolish it if they could. This, perhaps, is the latest sign that they have learnt nothing from their election defeat. Support for hard-working families is now a key dividing line between the two major parties in our country. The working families tax credit will make work pay and give parents a real incentive. It will leave 1 2 million families, on average, 24 a week better off.
At the end of July we finally saw the Fairness at Work legislation reach the statute book, on the very last day of that parliamentary session – a new settlement for the workplace, a settlement based on partnership and minimum standards, for the first time, part-timers with the same employment rights as full-time workers, part-time workers at long last no longer treated in law as second-class citizens, trade union recognition if that is what the workforce wants, unfair dismissal regulations applying after 12 months and not two years, an end to blacklisting for trade union activity. We are going to make it unlawful to discriminate against an individual because they choose to belong to a trade union.
Whistleblowers, those courageous employees who expose wrongdoing in the workplace, often in a very vulnerable position: they will be entitled to unlimited compensation if they are unfairly dismissed – a clear indication of the importance of someone in that situation as events in Clapham with the rail crash and at the Bristol Royal Infirmary have all too clearly revealed.
I am also very conscious of the crucial work carried out by health and safety representatives. They are often in a very vulnerable position in the workplace when they try and secure a safe working environment. We need to find a way in Government to signal the important role that they play, and I was particularly pleased that we were able to introduce a late amendment to the legislation which ensures that if a health and safety representative is unfairly dismissed, there will be unlimited compensation to be paid to that individual.
Of course, in the Fairness at Work legislation, the union Movement has not secured everything it wanted; neither has the business community. A balance had to be struck and this was ‘fairness not favours’ in action.
In this changing world more parents are in work. One of the great challenges facing parents is how to juggle the responsibility of bringing up a family with holding down a job. We need to introduce family friendly policies into the workplace and we are beginning the process of doing that. We have extended maternity leave by four weeks. Additional maternity leave will be available after 12 months of employment, not the two years as at present. We have introduced 13 weeks parental leave for both mothers and fathers. We have introduced a right to time off work to deal with a family emergency, a right that will start from day one of employment. So no longer will a working parent have to worry about losing their job if they are called away to care for a sick son or daughter or to look after an ailing parent.
I recognise that the long hours culture that exists in our country is not supportive of family life and I know that many of you have concerns about changes we have proposed to the working time regulations. What is clear to me, both in relation to the working time regulations and our proposals for family friendly policies, is that we need to win over hearts and minds.
The adoption of these policies represents a major change in labour market policy, a change that can benefit both employers and employees, but they will only be of benefit if they are introduced in a sensitive and sympathetic way. I believe that these fundamental changes can be introduced in a way which secures our objectives without placing an undue bureaucratic burden on business.
It is not our intention to exclude white-collar workers from the protection offered by the Working Time Directive. I do not believe that our amendments to the regulations do that, but we need to make it crystal clear and I believe the best way of doing so will be to issue guidance on the regulations which will achieve that objective and which we will develop with the Health and Safety Executive. As is our usual practice, we will discuss the guidance with the TUC and with employers’ representatives.
As we implement detailed measures in the whole area of employment policy I want, wherever possible, to avoid the blunt instrument of regulation. Instead, we want to develop more flexible approaches to solving these common and shared problems. Alternative mechanisms, such as codes of conduct, need to be considered. Ensuring we achieve our goals will require more imagination and even greater constructive engagement from the unions particularly working in partnership with business.
That is why today I am pleased to announce that I am inviting applications to a Partnership Fund. The Partnership Fund will have , 5 million to help foster new attitudes and approaches to partnership in the workplace. Partnership must be seen as more than just a warm word. It should involve real changes in the workplace, new ways of working together, new approaches to training and development, new systems of performance and appraisal. There are many good examples of partnership in practice and we want the Partnership Fund to act as a catalyst, and we especially want ideas based on family friendly policies and on how the partnership approach can help small businesses.
Here in Britain we are putting in place the policies which will lay the foundation of economic success in the future, but any consideration of our future prosperity cannot ignore the question of Europe.
Now is the right time to make the case for Britain in Europe. We must do so from the standpoint of the British national interest. Nearly 60% of our trade, that is , 100 billion a year, is now within the European Union. The share of our exports going to EU countries has risen rapidly since we joined. Many markets which were closed in Europe have now been opened up and the UK has been at the forefront of that liberalisation agenda.
British jobs and investments increasingly depend on Europe. It is our key market. Our exports to France and Italy alone exceed those to the whole of North America, including the United States. Exports to Belgium and Luxembourg are double those exports from the UK to Japan. The figures speak for themselves.
Financial services, in which the City of London plays a vital role, now provide a million jobs in our country with overseas earnings in excess of , 25 billion a year. Europe is a great and growing market for these particular services.
In total, the jobs of probably millions of your members depend on Europe. As any inward investor will say, increased investment depends on two things above everything else – Britain’s modern flexible and stable economy, and its membership of the world’s largest market. There are 380 million consumers in the European Union. In the next ten years, with enlargement, there will be another 100 million more. This is the big prize that attracts the major players in our global economy.
It is against that backdrop that talk of renegotiation is so dangerous. Yet that is exactly what the Tory Party is doing. The effect of this marked shift in Tory thinking in Europe is to ensure that the issue of Britain in Europe is now at the heart of the party political debate. It means that yet again in this generation we will need to make the case for British involvement and participation in Europe, for the benefits of EU membership will once again need to be proclaimed.
This is now a battle that we must win, that we cannot afford to lose. Over the years it is a question that we have faced on a number of occasions – in or out of Europe? In the end, often after long and agonized debates, we have always chosen to be in. That conclusion has not been as a result of a triumph of political dogma over reason or by submitting to some powerful vested interest, but it has been due to sound common sense and always putting the national interest first.
Europe matters politically and economically. Influence and partnership in Europe is essential to the British national interest. The Conservatives have confused the powerful case for reform in Europe – and there is a powerful case for changing Europe – with the case for disengagement and a retreat to the margins. Those of us who believe in the importance of Europe must be the first to recognise and to argue that the Europe we have today, its institutions, its working practices and its policy priorities, are not designed for the challenges we now face. Reform in Europe is vital because it needs direction for the future. It needs to reflect the challenge of the global economy in the 21st century.
Europe must make a reality of the Single Market in all sectors. It must recognise that regulation can be a barrier to growth and job creation. To achieve this reform programme Europe needs to be more forward-looking, working to an agenda of education, enterprise and innovation so that the knowledge-based economy of the future is seen as a bringer of opportunity and not as a threat. We need to engage at all times to be building political alliances and to be shaping Europe’s development, not having it shaped by others, which has been the case far too often in the past.
As soon as we came to office we pressed the case for economic reform to make the product, labour and capital markets of Europe more flexible. Without banging the table, we have successfully promoted Britain’s interests by arguing our case and, as a result, we have been able to cap the growth in European Union spending, to win a higher share of funding from regional and structural funds for the next six years, to safeguard our nation’s border controls, to end the beef ban by agreement on the basis of solid, scientific evidence, and we have protected our rebate.
So we can see the benefits of Britain in Europe and the success that we can achieve as a result of constructive engagement. In all our dealings with Europe we must always act in the national interest. The British people would rightly expect nothing less.
That must also be our response to the single currency. There is endless speculation about the Government changing our position on the euro, that we have gone cool on the idea or that we have become more enthusiastic, that the brakes have been applied or that our foot has now been pushed down hard on the accelerator. All this press speculation has meant that a Norwegian forest has been felled for no good purpose.
Our policy remains the same. It was stated by the Chancellor in October 1997 and repeated by the Prime Minister on 23rd February this year. The Government’s view is that membership of a successful single currency would bring benefits to Britain in terms of jobs, investment and trade. The Chancellor has laid down five tests that will need to be satisfied in our national economic interest and, of course, the final decision will rest with the British people in a referendum.
Now some people argue that we should rule out joining for a period, whatever the economic conditions. Some say that we should set a date for joining, whatever the economic conditions, and I understand that we may well be hearing these arguments put forward during the course of Congress this week. Without wishing to cause offence, I want to make it clear that the Government rejects both approaches. No one will push the Government into adopting either of these two positions because we believe they are not right for Britain, they are not in our national interest. Meeting the economic conditions will be the test. It is principled, pragmatic and practical. It is our settled conviction and will remain our policy.
Congress, as we survey the world in the dying months of the 20th century, one thing is clear: we are living in a world of change. The nature of work also is changing. More of our people work part-time, and in many cases choose to do so. Many people work on a temporary basis or have fixed-term contracts. Fewer work on the shop floor and there has been an explosion of serviced-based jobs. More people work in small businesses. The composition of the workforce is also changing. More women are working. Some 52% of married women with children under 5 are now in work, more than double the situation a generation ago. More families depend on two earners.
The businesses and organisations that people work for face new challenges, more competition, a greater pressure to innovate to stay ahead and a greater pace of change. Businesses are having to become more flexible, more and more people are being asked to take on real responsibility in the workplace.
Change is the order of the day. We all need to recognise that and the union Movement is no exception. The advantage of the Government having laid down the conditions for economic stability is that it gives us all the space we need to react to these longer-term trends. We must see change as an opportunity and not as a threat.
We all have a role to play here but only if we are prepared to embrace change, because these new working patterns put new responsibilities on all of us, whether in Government, in business or in trade unions – a responsibility on Government to ensure minimum standards of fairness, to promote the benefits of electronic commerce and the Internet for business, and to create a climate for economic prosperity; a responsibility on business to work in partnership and to ensure that the task of making a reality of a flexible labour market does not fall solely on working people; a responsibility on trade unions, on yourselves, to seek consensus and not conflict, to support dialogue and avoid damaging disputes.
Flexibility does not have to, and must not, mean insecurity and poor treatment for people in the workplace. This only leads to additional stress for the many whose lives are already too stressful, leads to low morale and poor productivity. We must help people to adapt to the new world of fast changing markets and shifting patterns of work without sacrificing their quality of life. On many occasions the trade unions have been at the forefront of change over the years. You have been swift to adapt to the vast changes in collective bargaining that we have witnessed over the last 20 years.
Unions now negotiate a far wider range of packages for their members, embracing new forms of pay and new forms of working. Unions were among the first to recognise the importance of training, with support for modern apprenticeships and the need to train workers in broad based skills throughout their working lives. Unions have embraced the Investors in People approach. One reason why the UK’s health and safety record is one of the world’s best is the important role which trade unions have played on safety issues.
Union structures and services have adapted greatly to changed labour markets. The challenge for unions, as for our country, is exactly the same: it is to modernise and reform, to find new ways to work with members and their employers, to raise skills, improve productivity and play a role in making Britain a more prosperous and competitive nation.
Working in partnership with business, working with your members to strengthen their skills and to deal with a more challenging labour market is the new agenda for the trade union Movement, and it is one which we in Government support. In a world of change, to look back is to condemn yourself to opposition; this is a lesson William Hague needs to learn. We cannot a build a future for our people based on a return to all our yesterdays. Those who resist change are not learning the lessons of history but are living history.
Halfway through a Parliament is often the most challenging time for a government in office because voices call for consolidation, a reconsideration of our objectives and our priorities. But this is not the time to stand still. Now is the moment for Government to push forward on our agenda of modernisation and reform. If the world changes but we as a political party do not, then we become redundant and our principles become dogma. That is why as a party we have changed. In government we have demonstrated the nature of that change, not to betray our principles but to carry them out; not to lose our identity, but to keep our relevance.
It is because of that change that we are able to be a progressive force for fairness and justice and not an historical footnote. There can be no distractions or diversions from the task before us. Our objective must be a dynamic, knowledge‑based economy founded on individual empowerment and opportunity, where government enables but does not dictate and the power of the market is harnessed to serve the public interest.
The challenge for government is how to prepare Britain for a world in which change is continuous and knowledge is the new currency. Successful economies and societies will be those that can adapt to the demands of such rapid change, that are flexible and creative and manage change rather than become overwhelmed by it, finding new ways to include all the people. Our approach is built around a new coalition but with clear objectives to create a better standard of life for all our people to ensure British business succeeds at home and abroad, to tackle exploitation in all its forms. This is an approach which recognises that the role of Government itself has fundamentally changed, but that it still has a critical part to play in improving the performance of the British economy and improving the quality of life for all our people.
First and foremost, we must create a stable economic environment, ending the wealth‑destroying cycle of boom and bust that has dogged British business and the British economy since the war. We must never forget, and never return to, those days in the early 1990s where we saw inflation at 10%, interest rates at 15% and over a million manufacturing jobs lost.
Stability matters in our new economy because, more than ever, we need businesses to invest in knowledge and to take risks to stay ahead in fast‑moving markets. We can ill‑afford this vital investment to be put off through fears about economic stability and the long‑term future.
With stability achieved and uncertainty removed, there are great opportunities ahead. Those opportunities will only be achieved if we embrace the new and leave behind the old ways of doing things. On the eve of the new century, the challenge facing us all is how we can ensure that people become partners in change and not the victims of change. I am confident that, by working together ‑‑ trade unions, business and the Government ‑‑ we will be able to meet that challenge and, in so doing, that we will be able to discharge our joint responsibilities to your members, our people and our country.
",1999 Speech to TUC Conference,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/stephen-byers-1999-speech-to-tuc-conference/
Justin Madders,United Kingdom,2020-07-14,"Councils are getting testing data which is sometimes nearly a fortnight old and has such little information in it that it is virtually useless in being able to spot and stop local outbreaks.
We are asking that positive test results are given to councils on a daily basis, in real time if possible, and that there should be sufficient information for them to be able to identify the workplace if possible, where an outbreak has occurred.
The Government needs to be much more open and transparent with local councils so that together we can catch local outbreaks earlier and stop transmission of the virus.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-08-01,"So, Rush, I just wanted to congratulate you on 30 years. I wanted to call personally and congratulate you.
You're a very special man, Rush, and you have people that love you. I'm one of them. But you're a very, very special guy. What you do for this country, people have no idea how important your voice is. So I just wanted to personally make this one and I said, ""I'll even dial the number myself if I have to.""
But I just want to congratulate you. Thirty years in that tough business is incredible -- and you're stronger now than ever before.
Well, it's a thrill to be on.
Yes, go ahead, Rush. Go ahead.
Right.
Well, I love these people. And, you know, you probably saw last night I was in Florida and we had 9,000 seats in the auditorium.
That was packed, and we had thousands outside and in these rooms all over the place. I guess they had at least 15,000, 18,000 people that couldn't get in last night -- which I hate. So we're actually starting to put up big screens. I must tell you, it's such an honor to me to see this. This love!
I don't know if you were able to see it last night, any of them. I mean, there's such tremendous love. I'm going to Ohio on Saturday, and tomorrow I'm going to Pennsylvania, and it's the same thing.
It's like the enthusiasm -- and part of it is that they've really been mistreated for so many years by the politicians. The country's been mistreated. The trade deals were so bad. The taxes were so high. The tax cuts are so good; they've been so appreciated by so many people. The cut in regulations maybe is just as important as the tax cuts because businesses are hiring like they haven't, like they've never hired before.
And, you know, we have a more interesting stat: We have more people working in the United States today than at any time in our history. And it's been so many different things are happening. So there's a tremendous amount of love in the room, and I am aware of it; there's no question about it.
Well, that's right, Rush. You have a lot of bad people in Washington. You knew that a long time ago. Frankly, before I knew it. I had no idea how evil some of them are, but you have a lot of great people too. And outside of Washington you have the greatest people in the world.
And you're right. You know, I've been saying 4%, but it should be much higher than that. You know, if you do good trade deals -- which I will. You see what's going on with China. You look at what's going on.
I will tell you, NAFTA? They want to make a deal very badly. And, you know, we're putting 'em back in shape. They're horrible deals, the worst deals ever made by any country. You do that; you start lifting your GDP numbers way up also. Nobody ever ever talks about that. We're doing 4.1% with bad trade deals. We have horrible trade deals.
And our farmers, we're gonna open up markets for them. You know, but they're great patriots. They're... I watch them all the time where they're saying, ""We trust our president.""
And, you know, they may take a short-term hit. But you look at farm and farming, it's been going down for 15 years. Soybeans, five years before the election, was cut in half! The price was cut in half. I wasn't there. So it's going to... A lot of things are happening that are very exciting.
And, you know, you look at the job numbers. You look at African-American, best ever. Hispanic, Asian, women, best ever! And it's been a lot of fun for me, but I see the happiness and the faces.
Like last night in Florida with that, you know, really massive crowd, you see the happiness and the love -- and nobody left. It's like you. Nobody turns off your show. It's like you can't. Nobody leaves. You know, I'll speak for an hour and 10 minutes, hour and 20 minutes. There wasn't a person that left that room.
It was just... It was an absolute love fest, and it's going on all over the country, and a lot of it's the same message. Most of it, I think -- probably all of it -- is the same message that you give out so well every day, better than anybody.
Yeah.
Yeah, I actually think it would be positive.
We had Obamacare repealed and replaced, and a man -- I won't mention his name. But a man at 2 o'clock in the morning went thumbs down, and he campaigned for years on repeal and replace. We had the chance. Nobody even spoke to him about it, because it was something that was unthinkable what he did, and because of that... But still, I have just about ended Obamacare. We have great health care. We have a lot of great things happening right now. New programs are coming out.
We got rid of the individual mandate. But that was very disappointing to me that night -- and he did it because of me, probably. But that was very disappointing. That was a horrible thing he did to our country. And, frankly, it cost $1 trillion because we would have saved $1 trillion, on top of which we would have had good health care.
But we're doing it a different way. We have to go a different route. But he cost us a trillion dollars. And the other thing is the wall. We've started it. It's like pulling teeth, though, getting these guys to get it done is. You have no idea how tough I've been. I say, ""Hey, if you have a shutdown, you have a shutdown.""
Now, the shutdown could also take place after the election. I happen to think it's a great political thing, because people want border security. It's not just the wall, Rush, as you know. It's border security. It's getting rid of catch-and-release, where you catch somebody, he can be a criminal of the highest order, and you have to release him! You catch him, you take his name, and you release him.
And then you have the visa lottery. It's a lottery system where you pick people out of a lottery. Well, the countries aren't giving us their best people. They're giving us people that they don't want. So we're taking people out of a lottery that the country doesn't want. We're getting some beauties. And then you have, you know, so many other things.
We have to change the laws. We have the worst laws! How about chain migration? One person comes in and you end up with 32 people. The person that ran down 18 people on the West Side Highway, he's allowed to have -- and I think eight died. He has 22 members of his family in the United States because of chain migration.
So we have to change this stuff, Rush. And we'll get it done, but we have to change it, Rush. If we don't change it, it will just go down, down, down. And it will get done. One way or the other, it's getting done. But I'd be willing to do it. And you could do it before the election or after the election.
Right.
I know. I've heard that.
Well, I've heard them. Probably different people than you, but I've heard a lot of people saying, ""Oh, don't do it before the election, we'll upset the applecart,"" and because we are doing so well economically we should do well -- and, you know, the polls are okay. It's very interesting. My polls are great, but the question is, ""Is it transferable?""
Now, it certainly was in Florida because you saw Ron DeSantis, who's gotten a tremendous -- you know, many, many, many points. The governor of Georgia where he was down by five and he won by 40 after I endorsed him. That was almost like your endorsement.
If you take a look at Congressman Donovan from Staten Island where he was down by 10 and he wins by 24. So we've had a lot of impact. And that's why I'm going around. But I have to say that I have heard this theory. I happen to think it's a good thing politically. I'm not doing it for politics. I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do.
So I'm not looking at politics. But I happen to think that border security would be a good thing before the election, but there are many people within our party that are good people that are like you that agree with you on everything you say. But they'd rather do it after.
They don't agree on doing it before, and I accept their opinion, but I happen to think it would be a good thing to do before. I actually think we'd get more and there'd be more pressure on the other side, because we're doing it because the Democrats are not giving us the votes.
Well...
Well, if you do it before, there's a lot more pressure to get a great solution. But it's riskier. If you do it afterwards, there's less pressure; there's less risk. I'm just not sure you'd make as good a deal. I will say a lot of people -- good people -- you know, would ask me in the nicest of ways, ""Could we do it after the election?"" So --
Yeah, and they've been good to me. I've had a lot of good support within the Republican Party, and you saw the poll numbers in the Republican Party. They like me so I have to keep them a little bit happy. But whether it's before or after? But I actually think it's a great campaign issue. I think it would be great before.
But I don't want to disappoint a lot of very good people that are working with me -- and, Rush, I have to tell you, I've got some really good support within the Republican Party, too.
Well, I think it's largely instinct. I have some great people. I really do. You know, you heard me tell the story last night maybe where, you know, I've been in Washington 17 times. In my whole life, I never stayed here. Now, all of a sudden, I'm riding down Pennsylvania Avenue and I'm president. So I don't know a lot of people. Now I think I know everybody in Washington. I never stayed a night in Washington, I don't believe. And, you know, I've probably been here 17, 18 times.
I'm from New York. But very rarely. And, all of a sudden, I'm president. And like Mike Pompeo. What a change that was. Mike is doing an incredible job. What a terrific guy -- and I know you like him and he likes you. But we have some great people, and I've made some changes. But we're really close to getting a fantastic -- really just a fantastic group of people. We have some really great ones, and I think that's reflective on the success that we're having as an administration.
Well, thank you. You know, people don't realize what a great achievement 30 years is in that cutthroat business that you happen to be in. You know, you might not find that 'cause you're so good at what you do. But that is a cutthroat business, and for you to do this for 30 years is truly an amazing accomplishment, and there's no voice like it.
Even your friend Hannity agrees with that. Donald Trump
He calls you ""the dean.""
No, he's great. He's a tremendous fan of yours. They all are. Everybody is. So I just want to congratulate you. Thirty years of... Just do it for another 30 years. After that, you can take it easy, okay?
Okay. You have a deal.
And thank you very much, Rush. So important what you do. Thank you.
Take care of yourself. Good-bye.
",Interview: Rush Limbaugh Interviews Donald Trump on the Radio,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-rush-limbaugh-august-1-2018
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-05-01,"That's OK.
A little bit has happened, yeah...
Right.
OK, good.
Which one?
Well, assuming it's like we agreed. You know, we're getting a billion and a half for border security, which is very important to me. We're already down 63 percent of crossings, which is at a record. There's never been a record like that. I'm sorry, 73 percent as of this morning, 73. It was actually reported last week at 73. It's going to go up this week too, so it's going to -- you know, so we're doing very well.
Some people say, ""Oh, you're doing so well, maybe you don't need the wall."" We do need the wall, for drugs. We need the wall for human trafficking, which is a problem that you should write something about at some point. You know, unrelated to me, but the human trafficking problem is probably worse than it ever was in history, if you think about it. You know, you think about 400 years ago or something but if -- human trafficking is an unbelievable problem, a worldwide problem, so we need the wall. But no, we have a billion and a half for -- for border security. You saw that.
No, we're very happy with it. And I think it's important that we keep moving along. I think both sides are happy. Excuse me?
Well, I have to see what the final is. But yeah, if it's -- if it's as we discussed, the answer's yes.
Well, you have to remember, this is all coming due again in September, October, and we're going to have another round of discussions.
No, I think it's a deal that is -- look, the Democrats are obstructionists; that's all they can do is obstruct. They have no leadership. And we have to agree, and I think both -- both sides agree, we have to keep government going, we don't want to shut government. So -- so we're -- we'll have more of these to discuss in the future.
Yeah, we're having pre-existing conditions. That's it. Plus, we're having the pool, we're doing a lot of things. And the best thing that is happening with the health care is premiums will come down. We'll have tremendous competition; you know, we're getting rid of the border state lines, and we're going to have tremendous competition. We're going to have insurance companies fighting, like life insurance. You know, we -- life insurance, you have these companies that are like -- like going all over the place. We're going to have a tremendous -- tremendously competitive market and health care costs are going to be forced down.
The one thing people don't say is how bad Obamacare is doing. You know, I was in Tennessee, where half of the state has lost its insurance and the other half is going in two months. That means Tennessee has no carriers. That means they have no insurance. Kentucky is going to be pulled out.
They're pulling out of many states. And people don't report the fact that Obamacare is dead. It's not like -- it's not like, ""Oh, gee"" -- like for instance, when they want to compare -- first of all, we're going to have lower premiums. We're going to have lower deductibles. We're going to have much better health care. But they like to try and compare things, the ideal situation to Obamacare. But there is no Obamacare. Obamacare is -- is dead. You -- you understand what I mean by -- it can't survive.
I'm going to look -- I'll look at every provision. I tell you what. If people are going to -- first of all, this bill is much better for people than Obamacare. And it's a repeal -- it in the -- in its final form will be a full -- you know, will be a repeal and replacement of Obamacare. But -- and -- and -- and one other thing. It was a little misunderstood. I wish they didn't set a line -- you know, approve it by two weeks ago. Because all this is is a continuation of -- of a negotiation that started a month ago -- a month and a half ago. Obamacare took 17 months to get approved. We're now on our sixth week of -- you know, of health care. The end result is going to be a really good bill if we get it -- if we get it approved.
And -- and it'll be good -- knowing that you have Republicans, Democrats. But even with the Republicans, you have conservatives, you have moderates. You have many different factions. And all good people, and they all want something different. You know, it's -- it's something that's very interesting. I think the -- the -- I know that the end result will be very good, and...
What's that?
Well, I want it to be good for sick people, Jen. Well, you know it's not in its final form right now.
I'll be looking into that...
I'll be looking at it very closely. But we have -- in terms of exactly what you're talking about, it will be better than Obamacare.
Well, we are protecting pre-existing conditions. And it'll be every good -- bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare.
And Obamacare -- just so you know, Obamacare's terrible on pre-existing conditions. You know why?
Because you're not going to have it. It's folding. It's gone. If -- if I don't do anything -- you know my famous statement that I really believe in to this day. Don't do anything for a year, let Obamacare go out of business, and then come up with a new plan. So, Obamacare doesn't cover pre-existing conditions because it's not going to be here. It -- it can't...
No, but...
But -- but I -- I do...
I do. But I'm just telling you, Obamacare doesn't cover pre-existing conditions because it won't be here. I -- I would mind that quote.
It's a risque quote. But it's true.
What I want to do -- I want it to be a great deal for the people. I do. And if it's not going to be good, I'm not going to sign it.
No, if it's not going to be good, I'm not going to sign it.
But it's going to be...
No, no. I want -- I want -- I want people to be taken care of...
... properly. And they're not being taken care of now.
I'd like them to be permanent. You're -- you're talking about if they make it like a four-year deal or something?
Yeah.
I know. I -- I'd like it to be permanent. Don't forget -- OK, so here's something very important. So we're doing a very big tax cut. We need it. The economy's growing at 1 -- not growing, it's not growing at all. It's a GDP of 1 percent. That's really bad, and the first quarter, second quarter really isn't my quarter. That's really a leftover from -- in all fairness, I just got here.
So -- so you're growing at 1 percent or less in the country. So we need something -- we need a stimulus. But when you talk about putting money back in, my new trade deals are going to bring a lot of money back in, my cost savings are going to bring a lot of money back in. I'll give you an example. So, nobody wrote -- wrote this story, but maybe somebody should. The F-35 fighter jet -- I saved -- I got involved in the negotiation. It's 2,500 jets. I negotiated for 90 planes, lot 10. I got $725 million off the price. Probably, if I -- if I added up the entire time I -- I worked on it, it was like an hour, but I got $725 million off the price. There's so many things we can save on. There's so much.
Including health care. We're going to end up with better health care at a lower price. People are going to pay less and they're going to have a lower deductible. You know, the biggest -- the second biggest problem, other than premiums, with Obamacare is the deductibles. They're so high, nobody's going to get to use them.
So I'll tell you what's -- what was very interesting. The truckers came to see me. And I have very good relationships with the truckers. I have one friend who's a big trucker and he's -- he's like -- said, ""I've never seen anything like it,"" you know, with the roads -- you've heard this story -- with the roads, and his trucks are all being destroyed, and he's going to start buying cheap equipment now. Yeah, the roads are in bad shape. But I've -- I've -- had the truckers come to see me, that if we earmarked money toward the highways that they would -- that they would not mind a tax -- you know, gas tax or some form of tax.
So I haven't -- I haven't made a commitment. But they would like it, because they say the roads are in such bad condition.
We can't allow that.
The truckers have said that they want me to do something, as long as that money is earmarked to highways.
You could say that I had that meeting.
Well, it's something that I would certainly consider, that -- because they've asked me to consider it.
Well, on infrastructure...
The Democrats want infrastructure, they want a trillion-dollar bill, and I'm totally open to that. We are in agreement there. I think where I'm in most -- best agreement with the Democrats are that and trade. You know, I had -- Jennifer, you reported this once. I had a lot of Bernie Sanders voters for me.
People don't realize how many. And it was all because of trade, because the one thing that I agreed with him on -- not much -- but the one thing was trade. Because he knows the United States is being ripped off on trade. He's the only one that got it. And nobody's tougher on trade than I am.
Yeah.
Well, everything...
... honestly, Jennifer...
Everything's a starting point. Look...
Obviously, you can't just say, you know, I'm living with -- everything's a starting point. But hopefully, I don't have to change it very much, and maybe I won't have to change it at all, but everything's a starting point.
There's always something you can lose.
Yes, there are a couple of things but I can't tell you what they are.
I would like to keep it as low as possible. But we're going to bring a lot of money in on trade. We're going to bring a lot of money on reciprocal. You know, as an example, when you have countries with a big tax and we get nothing for the same product and we're paying -- our companies are paying 100 percent tax in some countries and if they send their product to us we pay nothing. Doesn't make sense. I'm a big believer in a reciprocal tax. Now, this is trade we're talking about, not...
But you know -- because I actually think the border tax -- the concept of border tax is more of a trade issue than it is a -- so when we talk about income coming in, I believe border tax in its form, if we use that, reciprocal tax is a tax that I really love because basically nobody can fight it. If a country's charging us 52 percent and we're charging them nothing for the same product going back and forth, nobody can fight. I've even said to other countries -- I've said, ""Listen, you're charging us a lot. We're going to charge you the same thing."" They shrug their shoulders.
They can't fight it. But if you say you're going to put a 10 percent tax on -- everyone says, ""Oh, you're taxing. You're taxing."" I love a reciprocal tax. Nobody can fight it, it's fair and it's something that we are working on very strongly. But a lot of the taxes in terms of income coming in are taxes that I'm viewing more in the trade tax than I am in the other. Like you've heard me say that when somebody -- when a big car company -- you saw they're moving back into Michigan.
They're moving big league back into Michigan. I mean, I don't want to say it, because I don't want to anger the Mexicans any more than they're already angered. But, you know, a couple of companies started building plants and they actually stopped and now they're expanding in Michigan and they're moving back in into Ohio and different states. They're moving back in because they think that I'm going to charge them 35 percent if they build their -- fire all their employees, go to Mexico, build a factory, build a car and put it -- or air conditioner or whatever it is -- and sell it back in. I tell them, ""You're going to have a 35 percent tax to pay,"" or a very substantial tax.
And now, they're saying, ""We're building in Michigan and we're building in Ohio."" You see what's going on with the car companies. You ought to call Ford. Call Mr. Fields, the head of Ford. Call Mary Barra, head of General Motors. You could call Fiat. You know, you could call Fiat. You could call -- we had that meeting. They're all talking about building in the United States because of me.
By the way, if my opponent won, you would have -- the companies would be fleeing right now. Now, couple of things. They love the tax cut, OK? They love my regulation cuts, which are going to be -- I think they're -- personally, it's a big thing. I think the regulation cuts are going to have an even bigger impact than the massive tax cuts. And this is the biggest tax cut in history. This is bigger than Reagan. Remember we used to say, ""The biggest since Reagan""? I used to say that. This is actually bigger than Reagan tax cuts. But what they are is the biggest regulation cuts in history by far.
Well, when the industry comes to me, when the trucking industry comes to me and says that the highways are so bad that their trucks are being destroyed, you know, badly hurt, badly -- really badly hurt, damaged from New York to California, and that truckers want to buy crummy equipment now because they -- you know, I mean, this guy used to always pride himself on buying the best.
He said, ""I get -- I go from New York to California and we got -- our tires are all beat up and"" -- because, you know, they're running over potholes, they're running over gravel, they're running over bad roads, you know, the roads are worn out so it wears out the rubber. And the -- the stuff goes and splatters all over the -- you know, the bottom of the trucks and they're all beat to hell.
Well, he said it would never -- I said, ""How has it been?"" He's -- 40 years he's been in business. I said, ""How has it been?"" He said, ""It's never been like this.""
Well, I'm just telling you, I -- I haven't even mentioned this to anybody. I mean, I'm giving you something first. I find that people are very open to the reciprocal tax. Because it's just all we're doing is saying, ""Whatever you're doing, we're doing."" It's -- it's -- I love the reciprocal tax.
Now, in theory -- if they're charging 50 percent and we're charging nothing, in theory what they should do is say, ""OK, we'll all charge nothing."" But either way, it's -- you know, it's -- it's a great tax. And it's a very free trade tax if you think about it, because, you know, depending on the amount and the volumes and everything else, in theory they should bring it down to nothing or whatever they get, we get.
So you could do the reciprocal tax is something that's very important to me. So we're going to have a lot of money coming in. But it comes in through trade and it comes in through renegotiating NAFTA. Now, just -- and by the way you've been to plenty of my speeches. I would always say, ""We will renegotiate NAFTA or terminate it, right?"" I never said, ""We'll terminate it.""
. So -- and just so we put it finally on the record, I think you saw me do the little quick interview there on the NAFTA because it's very simple. I was getting ready to terminate NAFTA, I got a call from Mexico and he said, ""I would appreciate you not doing that."" I got a call, amazingly, within 20 minutes from Justin, from Canada -- and I have a good relationship with both; I like them both a lot. And they said, ""Could we negotiate instead of you terminating?"" I said, ""Yes."" I was going to terminate on Saturday. I had the papers. Is it true? The papers were ready -- the termination papers were ready.
Well, the biggest problem I have is this -- this fast start or whatever they call...
Fast-track. It's a horrible situation. We put our papers in 60 days ago for fast-track. We still haven't been approved, because the Democrats are holding them up. So I want to start negotiating and is it a 90- or 100-day period, what is it?
Ninety-day period. So I put my papers in 60 days ago to renegotiate NAFTA and I can't -- I still don't have them approved. That means in theory, we can't negotiate until they're approved. The Democrats are holding them up. Wyden.
A lot.
Yeah, a lot. Oh, it's got to be -- it's very unfair.
We have massive deficits with Mexico. You know, we're losing -- we have a trade deficit with Mexico of almost $70 billion. We have a trade deficit with Canada of approximately $15 billion. The lumber coming in from Canada is -- is killing us -- is killing us. The dairy that's not going into Canada from Wisconsin, a state that I happen to love, is absolutely unfair.
Oh, we'll change a lot in NAFTA. But -- but you have to understand, I have a problem with Congress. They won't approve to start. So this is supposed to be fast-track, but it has to be approved. You put your papers in, and they're tying it into my trade negotiator. They're saying, ""It doesn't start until your trade negotiator's approved."" Well, they're holding him up. The law -- it says, you know, the trade -- your trade representative, which is Lighthizer.
Which -- by the way, which is very unfair. You understand that. So I'm trying to get -- because Mexico wants to start now and so does Canada. They're all set. And I've got to keep waiting for Congress? Our system is archaic.
The biggest thing -- and they don't talk about it. But the biggest beneficiaries are going to be the middle class, of the tax cut, and we're going to keep it that way. When you say, ""Is there anything you won't change?"" that's something I won't change. And also...
Because they're going down to 10 percent. They're going down to 10 percent. And don't...
I had a feeling she was getting there.
Breaking -- we have breaking news. Is this going to be breaking news, Jennifer.
OK. So, we have a potentially very bad situation that we will meet in the toughest of all manners if we have to do that. If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely -- I would be honored to do it. If it's under the -- again, under the right circumstances. But I would -- I would do that. Hey, look, I'm meeting with Abbas on Wednesday, the leader of Palestine.
You think that's slightly smaller, right? I'm meeting with Abbas on Wednesday. And people are saying that's a very good thing to do, because I'd like to see peace in the Middle East and I'd like to see the Palestinians and the Israelis come together and Israel come together and have peace. Now -- so under the right circumstances, I -- under the right circumstances, I would be.
Well, I think he is -- look, we have tremendous power over there and we cannot allow him to do what he's doing. We cannot allow him to say what he's saying. He's making very provocative statements. We cannot allow that. We have tremendous --
So, we cannot let a situation happen where -- under any circumstances where he can launch missiles into the United States. Plus we happen to have great allies in that area and I feel very strongly toward those allies. So, yes, under the right circumstances, I would absolutely meet with him.
Now, most political people would never say that. But I'm telling you, under the right circumstances, I would meet with him. We have breaking news.
Yes, no.
I think so. You know, the one thing -- and I think you see it -- we have a lot of people that really do get along... Seriously, we have a lot of people.
Jared is a very brilliant young guy. Bannon has -- has, you know, I like him a lot.
He's actually a very good guy. Sometimes, I call him alt-left, OK? I mean, he's a...
Bannon's more of a libertarian than anything else, if you want to know the truth, OK? He's really -- you know, they give him a -- a bad rap. Bannon is a very decent guy who feels very strongly about the country. Likewise, Jared. And they're getting along fine. We have a -- they're getting along well. We have -- we have a lot of people that are getting along well. Although, it's coming out better now than it was, you know, for a while. And for a while it was a little testy, I guess for some of them, but I said, 'You've got to get your acts together.' You know, they're very competitive. We have very competitive people in this administration.
No, well, they're not competitors...
He's become the biggest star on television now, you know?
He's getting more than the ""Bold and the Beautiful"" guys, those handsome guys that they pay a fortune, right?
Yes, I am. I'm happy with everybody. I am.
No, I don't expect to see it. Now, I will tell you, probably people are going to get job offers. You know, things happen. But -- but I'm very happy with our group. We're doing very well. I think we're -- and you know, it's interesting. I think I'm getting very high marks on foreign policy. I noticed that over the last couple of days. I don't think of it as much, but we're getting very, very high marks on foreign policy.

First of all, since I started running, they haven't increased their -- you know, they have not manipulated their currency. I think that was out of respect to me and the campaign. But literally, since when I -- when it looked like I was starting to win the Republican primaries, which was actually pretty early, but they -- they haven't been.
But here's -- assuming they were and they're helping me with North Korea, I'm going to say -- ""By the way, how are you doing with North Korea?"" ""Well, blah, blah, blah."" ""Well, listen. We're going to name you a currency manipulator."" Think of it. ""I'm naming you a currency manipulator. How are you doing with North Korea.
Do you understand? So -- so ridiculous, but nobody ever says that. They'll say, ""Donald Trump did not come through with his thing on currency manipulation."" You can't be having them help us on something where millions and millions of lives are at stake and then say, ""We're going to name you a currency manipulator,"" right?
I like to tie them -- they never like to tie them together.
Yes.
Philippines is very important to me.
The Philippines is very important to me strategically and militarily. And I've had numerous conversations with the leader of the Philippines and -- and he's got a big problem. He's got a massive drug problem. He's been very, very tough on that drug problem, but he has a massive drug problem.
He is very popular in the Philippines. He has a very high approval rating in the Philippines. But he's very popular in the Philippines. I -- yes, I -- I look forward to meeting him. If he comes to the White House, that's fine. I look forward to meeting him. The Philippines are a very important -- I have many, many friends from the Philippines. They're great people. The Philippines strategically is very important to us. I think we'll have a great relationship with the Philippines. I think it's strategically very important to do so.
I'm looking at that right -- I didn't know this one was going to be brought up. But we are looking at that. There are -- you know, some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we're going to look at that. We're going to -- we're looking at it right now as we speak. And Dodd-Frank is -- is going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money.
Listen to you. You'll -- you'll start seeing things happen. You'll start seeing things happen. Right now, this is the end of the Obama era.
I don't like to put -- you know, guidelines on it. I can say this. You know, everyone talks about the 3 percent, 3 percent. I think we can do far more than 3 percent. And I think we can do more than 4 percent, eventually. Take time to get there. We've been more about -- we've been a country that has had such horrible rules and regulations. And there have been -- we've been stifled. We've been artificially stifled for so long. But I really think we can go higher than 4 percent, eventually.
I think so, I think great. He's all set.
I do. Well, they come down on the weekends. She just left. She's coming back down later.
It's a cocoon.
Yeah, they're -- they're already set. In fact, we just got him into a good school.
I won't tell you.

Penny Mordaunt,United Kingdom,2019-04-08,"Given this, it is both proper and timely to update the House on the steps which the UK Government are taking to continue to support the response in DRC and to ensure robust and effective preparedness in neighbouring countries.
As of 31 March 2019, 1,089 Ebola cases have been recorded (1,023 confirmed and 66 probable) and 679 people have died. Twenty-one health zones have been affected and 12 are currently reporting active new cases.
Despite the success of the response in curbing the disease in a number of health zones, the outbreak is still not under control. The last few weeks have seen a substantial increase in the number of cases reported, and the security context remains extremely challenging. In late February, two Médecins Sans Frontières Ebola treatment centres were attacked in Butembo and Katwa. The UK condemns these attacks in the strongest of terms; health workers fighting this disease should never be the target of violence and nor should patients.
The attacks underline the difficulty of responding to this outbreak in an area of ongoing conflict, and the vital importance of strengthening community engagement to break the chain of transmission. Despite the challenges faced there has not been a rapid rise in cases as was seen during the West Africa outbreak in 2014-16.
With UK support and technical advice, the response is now shifting to become more locally-owned, including through the hiring and training of more local staff, which will have the additional benefit of building longer-term health capacity and resilience. The response communications strategy has been revised to ensure that messages come primarily from local, influential leaders and figureheads.​
The UK remains one of the major supporters of the response and DFID has recently released new funds to the third strategic response plan for this outbreak. Some of this new funding has been used to target specific areas of the response that need strengthening, particularly around infection prevention and control, and water, sanitation and hygiene. The vaccination campaign remains a key element of the response, with over 93 thousand people vaccinated in DRC so far. Once again, at the request of the Government of DRC who are leading the response I am not announcing specific funding figures to avoid putting front-line responders at further risk of attack.
We welcome WHO and OCHA strengthening their leadership in-country to support the DRC Government in delivering an effective response.
There remains a significant risk of transmission to neighbouring countries and measures are being taken to prepare accordingly. The UK is leading donor efforts to support regional preparedness. In Uganda we have supported the vaccination of 4,420 front-line health workers, with a further 1,000 planned over the next month. We have also helped establish a screening facility at the border with DRC. In Rwanda we have strengthened surveillance activities at borders, carried out infection prevention and control training, and supported the roll out of vaccinations for at-risk health workers. We have also supported similar activities including in South Sudan, and have recently deployed staff to strengthen efforts in Burundi.
The risk of Ebola to the UK population remains very low. Public Health England continues to monitor the situation daily and review the risk assessment on a two-weekly basis.
The UK is committed to supporting our partners to end this outbreak of Ebola as quickly as possible. We have continued our “no regrets” approach, providing both funding and expertise—recognising that this is an international crisis that both requires and deserves a sustained international response. Tackling the spread of deadly diseases in Africa is firmly in our national interest—saving lives, reducing suffering, and helping prevent transmission across borders.

Barack Obama,United States of America,2012-11-14,"Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat. I hear you have some questions for me. But let me just make a few remarks at the top, and then I'll open it up.
First of all, I want to reiterate what I said on Friday. Right now, our economy is still recovering from a very deep and damaging crisis, so our top priority has to be jobs and growth. We’ve got to build on the progress that we’ve made, because this nation succeeds when we’ve got a growing, thriving middle class.
Now, on this last item, we face a very clear deadline that requires us to make some big decisions on jobs, taxes and deficits by the end of the year. Both parties voted to set this deadline. And I believe that both parties can work together to make these decisions in a balanced and responsible way.
Yesterday, I had a chance to meet with labor and civic leaders for their input. Today, I’m meeting with CEOs of some of America’s largest companies. And I’ll meet with leaders of both parties of Congress before the week is out. Because there’s only one way to solve these challenges, and that is to do it together.
As I’ve said before, I’m open to compromise and I’m open to new ideas. And I’ve been encouraged over the past week to hear Republican after Republican agree on the need for more revenue from the wealthiest Americans as part of our arithmetic if we’re going to be serious about reducing the deficit.
The other option is to pass a law right now that would prevent any tax hike whatsoever on the first $250,000 of everybody’s income. And by the way, that means every American, including the wealthiest Americans, get a tax cut. It means that 98 percent of all Americans, and 97 percent of all small businesses won’t see their taxes go up a single dime. The Senate has already passed a law like this. Democrats in the House are ready to pass a law like this. And I hope Republicans in the House come on board, too.
We should not hold the middle class hostage while we debate tax cuts for the wealthy. We should at least do what we agree on, and that's to keep middle-class taxes low. And I’ll bring everyone in to sign it right away so we can give folks some certainty before the holiday season.
I won’t pretend that figuring out everything else will be easy, but I'm confident we can do it -- and I know we have to. I know that that's what the American people want us to do. That was the very clear message from the election last week. And that was the message of a letter that I received over the weekend.
It came from a man in Tennessee who began by writing that he didn’t vote for me -- which is okay. But what he said was even though he didn’t give me his vote, he’s giving me his support to move this country forward. And he said the same to his Republican representatives in Washington. He said that he’ll back each of us, regardless of party, as long as we work together to make life better for all of us. And he made it clear that if we don’t make enough progress, he’ll be back in touch.
“My hope,” he wrote, “is that we can make progress in light of personal and party principles, special interest groups, and years of business as usual. We’ve got to work together and put our differences aside.”
I couldn't say it better myself. That’s precisely what I intend to do.
And with that, let me open it up for your questions. And I'm going to start off with Ben Feller of AP.
Obviously there’s an ongoing investigation. I don't want to comment on the specifics of the investigation. The FBI has its own protocols in terms of how they proceed, and I'm going to let Director Mueller and others examine those protocols and make some statements to the public generally.
But I want to emphasize that from my perspective at least, he has provided this country an extraordinary service. We are safer because of the work that Dave Petraeus has done. And my main hope right now is, is that he and his family are able to move on and that this ends up being a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career.
Jessica Yellin. Where’s Jessica?
But what I said at the time is what I meant, which is this was a one-time proposition. And what I have told leaders privately as well as publicly is that we cannot afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. What we can do is make sure that middle-class taxes don’t go up.
And so the most important step we can take right now -- I think the foundation for a deal that helps the economy, creates jobs, gives consumers certainty, which means gives businesses confidence that they're going to have consumers during the holiday season -- is if we right away say 98 percent of Americans are not going to see their taxes go up; 97 percent of small businesses are not going to see their taxes go up.
If we get that in place, we are actually removing half of the fiscal cliff. Half of the danger to our economy is removed by that single step.
And what we can then do is shape a process whereby we look at tax reform -- which I'm very eager to do. I think we can simplify our tax system. I think we can make it more efficient. We can eliminate loopholes and deductions that have a distorting effect on our economy. I believe that we have to continue to take a serious look at how we reform our entitlements, because health care costs continue to be the biggest driver of our deficits.
So there is a package to be shaped, and I'm confident that parties -- folks of goodwill in both parties can make that happen. But what I'm not going to do is to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent that we can't afford, and according to economists, will have the least positive impact on our economy.
And it’s very difficult to see how you make up that trillion dollars -- if we’re serious about deficit reduction -- just by closing loopholes and deductions. The math tends not to work. And I think it’s important to establish a basic principle that was debated extensively during the course of this campaign. I mean, this shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody. If there was one thing that everybody understood was a big difference between myself and Mr. Romney, it was when it comes to how we reduce our deficit, I argued for a balanced, responsible approach, and part of that included making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay a little bit more.
I think every voter out there understood that that was an important debate, and the majority of voters agreed with me. By the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me. So we’ve got a clear majority of the American people who recognize if we’re going to be serious about deficit reduction, we’ve got to do it in a balanced way.
The only question now is are we going to hold the middle class hostage in order to go ahead and let that happen? Or can we all step back and say, here’s something we agree on -- we don’t want middle-class taxes to go up. Let’s go ahead and lock that in. That will be good for the economy. It will be good for consumers. It will be good for businesses. It takes the edge off the fiscal cliff. And let’s also then commit ourselves to the broader package of deficit reduction that includes entitlement changes and it includes potentially tax reform, as well as I’m willing to look at additional work that we can do on the discretionary spending side.
So I want a big deal. I want a comprehensive deal. I want to see if we can, at least for the foreseeable future, provide certainty to businesses and the American people so that we can focus on job growth, so that we’re also investing in the things that we need. But right now what I want to make sure of is that taxes on middle-class families don’t go up. And there’s a very easy way to do that. We could get that done by next week.
Lori Montenegro, Telemundo.
And it is why I’m very confident that we can get immigration reform done. Before the election I had given a couple interviews where I predicted that the Latino vote was going to be strong, and that that would cause some reflection on the part of Republicans about their position on immigration reform. I think we’re starting to see that already. I think that's a positive sign.
This has not historically been a partisan issue -- we’ve had President Bush and John McCain and others who have supported comprehensive immigration reform in the past. So we need to seize the moment. And my expectation is, is that we get a bill introduced and we begin the process in Congress very soon after my inauguration. And in fact, some conversations I think are already beginning to take place among senators and congressmen and my staff about what would this look like.
And when I say comprehensive immigration reform, it is very similar to the outlines of previous efforts at comprehensive immigration reform. I think it should include a continuation of the strong border security measures that we’ve taken because we have to secure our borders. I think it should contain serious penalties for companies that are purposely hiring undocumented workers and taking advantage of them. And I do think that there should be a pathway for legal status for those who are living in this country, are not engaged in criminal activity, are here simply to work. It’s important for them to pay back-taxes. It’s important for them to learn English. It’s important for them to potentially pay a fine. But to give them the avenue whereby they can resolve their legal status here in this country I think is very important.
Obviously, making sure that we put into law what the first step that we’ve taken administratively dealing with the DREAM Act kids is very important as well. One thing that I’m very clear about is that young people who are brought here through no fault of their own, who have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to our flag, want to serve in our military, want to go to school and contribute to our society, that they shouldn’t be under the cloud of deportation, that we should give them every opportunity to earn their citizenship.
And so there are other components to it, obviously. The business community continues to be concerned about getting enough high-skill workers, and I am a believer that if you’ve got a PhD in physics or computer science who wants to stay here and start a business here, we shouldn’t make it harder for him to stay here; we should try to encourage him to contribute to this society.
I think that the agricultural sector obviously has very specific concerns about making sure that they’ve got a workforce that helps deliver food to our tables.
So there are going to be a bunch of components to it, but I think whatever process we have needs to make sure our border security is strong, needs to deal with employers effectively, needs to provide a pathway for the undocumented here, needs to deal with the DREAM Act kids. And I think that’s something that we can get done.
Chuck Todd. Where’s Chuck?
Are you withholding judgment on whether you should have known sooner that there was a potential -- that there was an investigation into whether your CIA Director -- potentially there was a national security breach with your CIA Director -- do you believe you should have known sooner? Are you withholding judgment until the investigation is complete on that front?
And then the follow-up to Jessica’s question -- tax rates. Are you -- is there no deal at the end of the year if tax rates for the top 2 percent aren’t the Clinton tax rates, period? No ifs, ands, or buts -- any room in negotiating on that specific aspect of the fiscal cliff?
With respect to the tax rates, I just want to emphasize I am open to new ideas. If Republican counterparts or some Democrats have a great idea for us to raise revenue, maintain progressivity, make sure the middle class isn’t getting hit, reduces our deficit, encourages growth, I’m not going to just slam the door in their face. I want to hear ideas from everybody.
My budget, frankly, does it. I understand that -- I don’t expect the Republicans simply to adopt my budget. That’s not realistic. So I recognize that we're going to have to compromise. And as I said on Election Night, compromise is hard, and not everybody gets 100 percent of what they want and not everybody is going to be perfectly happy.
But what I will not do is to have a process that is vague, that says we're going to sort of, kind of, raise revenue through dynamic scoring or closing loopholes that have not been identified. And the reason I won't do that is because I don’t want to find ourselves in a position six months from now or a year from now where, lo and behold, the only way to close the deficit is to sock it to middle-class families, or to burden families that have disabled kids or have a parent in a nursing home, or suddenly we've got to cut more out of our basic research budget that is the key to growing the economy in the long term.
So that’s my concern. I'm less concerned about red lines, per se. What I'm concerned about is not finding ourselves in a situation where the wealthy aren't paying more or aren't paying as much as they should, middle-class families one way or another are making up the difference -- that’s the kind of status quo that has been going on here too long, and that’s exactly what I argued against during this campaign. And if there’s one thing that I'm pretty confident about is the American people understood what they were getting when they gave me this incredible privilege of being in office for another four years.
They want compromise. They want action. But they also want to make sure that middle-class folks aren't bearing the entire burden and sacrifice when it comes to some of these big challenges. They expect that folks at the top are doing their fair share as well. And that’s going to be my guiding principle during these negotiations, but, more importantly, during the next four years of my administration.
Nancy Cordes.
And my hope is, before the end of the year, though, that we have a chance to sit down and talk. There are certain aspects of Governor Romney’s record and his ideas that I think could be very helpful.
So I’m not either prejudging what he’s interested in doing, nor am I suggesting I’ve got some specific assignment. But what I want to do is to get ideas from him and see if there are some ways that we can potentially work together.
There are probably going to be still some very sharp differences. And as I said during the campaign, there are going to be times where there are fights, and I think those are fights that need to be had. But what I think the American people don’t want to see is a focus on the next election instead of a focus on them.
And I don’t have another election. And Michelle and I were talking last night about what an incredible honor and privilege it is to be put in this position. And there are people all across this country, millions of folks, who worked so hard to help us get elected, but there are also millions of people who may not have voted for us but are also counting on us. And we take that responsibility very seriously. I take that responsibility very seriously. And I hope and intend to be an even better President in the second term than I was in the first.
Jonathan Karl.
But let me say specifically about Susan Rice, she has done exemplary work. She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill and professionalism and toughness and grace.
As I’ve said before, she made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her. If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. And I’m happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. Ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi, and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous.
And we’re after an election now. I think it is important for us to find out exactly what happened in Benghazi, and I’m happy to cooperate in any ways that Congress wants. We have provided every bit of information that we have, and we will continue to provide information. And we’ve got a full-blown investigation, and all that information will be disgorged to Congress.
And I don't think there’s any debate in this country that when you have four Americans killed, that's a problem. And we’ve got to get to the bottom of it, and there needs to be accountability. We’ve got to bring those who carried it out to justice. They won’t get any debate from me on that.
But when they go after the U.N. Ambassador, apparently because they think she’s an easy target, then they’ve got a problem with me. And should I choose, if I think that she would be the best person to serve America in the capacity of the State Department, then I will nominate her. That's not a determination that I’ve made yet.
Ed Henry.
But I want to stay on Benghazi, based on what Jon asked because you said, if they want to come after me, come after me. I wanted to ask about the families of these four Americans who were killed. Sean Smith’s father, Ray, said he believes his son basically called 911 for help and they didn't get it. And I know you’ve said you grieve for these four Americans, that it’s being investigated, but the families have been waiting for more than two months. So I would like to -- for you to address the families, if you can. On 9/11, as Commander-in-Chief, did you issue any orders to try to protect their lives?
But as I’ve said repeatedly, if people don’t think that we did everything we can to make sure that we saved the lives of folks who I sent there and who were carrying out missions on behalf of the United States, then you don’t know how our Defense Department thinks or our State Department thinks or our CIA thinks. Their number-one priority is obviously to protect American lives. That’s what our job is. Now --
I don’t presume that because I won an election that everybody suddenly agrees with me on everything. I’m more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms. We are very cautious about that. On the other hand, I didn’t get reelected just to bask in reelection. I got elected to do work on behalf of American families and small businesses all across the country who are still recovering from a really bad recession, but are hopeful about the future.
And I am, too. The one thing that I said during the campaign that maybe sounds like a bunch of campaign rhetoric, but now that the campaign is over I am going to repeat it and hopefully you guys will really believe me -- when you travel around the country, you are inspired by the grit and resilience and hard work and decency of the American people. And it just makes you want to work harder. You meet families who are -- have overcome really tough odds and somehow are making it and sending their kids to college. And you meet young people who are doing incredible work in disadvantaged communities because they believe in the American ideal and it should available for everybody. And you meet farmers who are helping each other during times of drought, and you meet businesses that kept their doors open during the recession, even though the owner didn’t have to take a salary.
And when you talk to these folks, you say to yourself, man, they deserve a better government than they've been getting. They deserve all of us here in Washington to be thinking every single day, how can I make things a little better for them -- which isn't to say that everything we do is going to be perfect, or that there aren't just going to be some big, tough challenges that we have to grapple with. But I do know the federal government can make a difference.
We're seeing it right now on the Jersey coast and in New York. People are still going through a really tough time; the response hasn't been perfect; but it's been aggressive and strong and fast and robust, and a lot of people have been helped because of it. And that’s a pretty good metaphor for how I want the federal government to operate generally, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure it does.
Christi Parson. Hey.
And on Iran, are you preparing a final diplomatic push here to resolve the nuclear program issue, and are we headed toward one-on-one talks?
We can then set up a structure whereby we are dealing with tax reform, closing deductions, closing loopholes, simplifying, dealing with entitlements. And I’m ready and willing to make big commitments to make sure that we’re locking in the kind of deficit reductions that stabilize our deficit, start bringing it down, start bringing down our debt. I’m confident we can do it.
And, look, I’ve been living with this for a couple of years now. I know the math pretty well. And it really is arithmetic; it’s not calculus. There are some tough things that have to be done, but there is a way of doing this that does not hurt middle-class families, that does not hurt our seniors, doesn’t hurt families with disabled kids, allows us to continue to invest in those things that make us grow, like basic research and education, helping young people afford going to college. As we’ve already heard from some Republican commentators, a modest tax increase on the wealthy is not going to break their backs; they’ll still be wealthy. And it will not impinge on business investment.
So we know how to do this. This is just a matter of whether or not we come together and go ahead and say, Democrats and Republicans, we’re both going to hold hands and do what’s right for the American people. And I hope that’s what happens.
With respect to Iran, I very much want to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem. I was very clear before the campaign, I was clear during the campaign, and I’m now clear after the campaign -- we’re not going to let Iran get a nuclear weapon. But I think there is still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically. We’ve imposed the toughest sanctions in history. It is having an impact on Iran’s economy.
There should be a way in which they can enjoy peaceful nuclear power while still meeting their international obligations and providing clear assurances to the international community that they’re not pursuing a nuclear weapon.
And so, yes, I will try to make a push in the coming months to see if we can open up a dialogue between Iran and not just us, but the international community, to see if we can get this things resolved. I can’t promise that Iran will walk through the door that they need to walk through, but that would be very much the preferable option.
Just going to knock through a couple others. Mark Landler. Where’s Mark? There he is right in front of me.
And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it.
Now, in my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. That will have an impact. That will take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere. We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation. And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere. But we haven't done as much as we need to.
So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, and elected officials to find out what can -- what more can we do to make a short-term progress in reducing carbons, and then working through an education process that I think is necessary -- a discussion, a conversation across the country about what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with.
I don't know what either Democrats or Republicans are prepared to do at this point, because this is one of those issues that's not just a partisan issue; I also think there are regional differences. There’s no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices. And understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that. I won't go for that.
If, on the other hand, we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth, and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader, I think that's something that the American people would support.
So you can expect that you’ll hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward.
All right, last question. Mark Felsenthal. Where’s Mark?
Obviously, the situation in Syria has deteriorated since then. We have been extensively engaged with the international community as well as regional powers to help the opposition. We have committed to hundreds of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid to help folks both inside of Syria and outside of Syria. We are constantly consulting with the opposition on how they can get organized so that they’re not splintered and divided in the face of the onslaught from the Assad regime.
We are in very close contact with countries like Turkey and Jordan that immediately border Syria and have an impact -- and obviously Israel, which is having already grave concerns, as we do, about, for example, movements of chemical weapons that might occur in such a chaotic atmosphere and that could have an impact not just within Syria, but on the region as a whole.
I’m encouraged to see that the Syrian opposition created an umbrella group that may have more cohesion than they’ve had in the past. We’re going to be talking to them. My envoys are going to be traveling to various meetings that are going to be taking place with the international community and the opposition.
We consider them a legitimate representative of the aspirations of the Syrian people. We’re not yet prepared to recognize them as some sort of government in exile, but we do think that it is a broad-based representative group. One of the questions that we’re going to continue to press is making sure that that opposition is committed to a democratic Syria, an inclusive Syria, a moderate Syria.
We have seen extremist elements insinuate themselves into the opposition, and one of the things that we have to be on guard about -- particularly when we start talking about arming opposition figures -- is that we’re not indirectly putting arms in the hands of folks who would do Americans harm, or do Israelis harm, or otherwise engage in actions that are detrimental to our national security.
So we're constantly probing and working on that issue. The more engaged we are, the more we'll be in a position to make sure that we are encouraging the most moderate, thoughtful elements of the opposition that are committed to inclusion, observance of human rights, and working cooperatively with us over the long term.
Thank you very much.
So thank you very much, guys.
",First Press Conference Following Presidential Reelection,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamapresserpetraeus.htm
William Howard Taft,United States of America,1911-01-26 00:00:00,"To the Senate and House of Representatives: 
In my annual message of December 6, 1910, I stated that the policy of broader and closer trade relations with the Dominion of Canada, which was initiated in the adjustment of the maximum and minimum provisions of the tariff act of August 5, 1909, had proved mutually beneficial and that it justified further efforts for the readjustment of the commercial relations of the two countries. I also informed you that, by my direction, the Secretary of State had dispatched two representatives of the Department of State as special commissioners to Ottawa to confer with representatives of the Dominion Government, that they were authorized to take steps to formulate a reciprocal trade agreement, and that the Ottawa conferences thus begun, had been adjourned to be resumed in Washington.
On the 7th of the present month two cabinet ministers came to Washington as representatives of the Dominion Government, and the conferences were continued between them and the Secretary of State. The result of the negotiations was that on the 21st instant a reciprocal trade agreement was reached, the text of which is herewith transmitted with accompanying correspondence and other data.
One by one the controversies resulting from the uncertainties which attended the partition of British territory on the American Continent at the close of the Revolution, and which were inevitable under the then conditions, have been eliminated--some by arbitration and some by direct negotiation. The merits of these disputes, many of them extending through a century, need not now be reviewed. They related to the settlement of boundaries, the definition of rights of navigation, the interpretation of treaties, and many other subjects.
Through the friendly sentiments, the energetic efforts, and the broadly patriotic views of successive administrations, and especially of that of my immediate predecessor, all these questions have been settled. The most acute related to the Atlantic fisheries, and this longstanding controversy, after amicable negotiation, was referred to The Hague Tribunal. The judgment of that august international court has been accepted by the people of both countries and a satisfactory agreement in pursuance of the judgment has ended completely the controversy. An equitable arrangement has recently been reached between our Interstate Commerce Commission and the similar body in Canada in regard to through rates on the transportation lines between the two countries.
The path having been thus opened for the improvement of commercial relations, a reciprocal trade agreement is the logical sequence of all that has been accomplished in disposing of matters of a diplomatic and controversial character. The identity of interest of two peoples linked together by race, language, political institutions, and geographical proximity offers the foundation. The contribution to the industrial advancement of our own country by the migration across the boundary of the thrifty and industrious Canadians of English, Scotch, and French origin is now repaid by the movement of large numbers of our own sturdy farmers to the northwest of Canada, thus giving their labor, their means, and their experience to the development of that section; with its agricultural possibilities.
The guiding motive in seeking adjustment of trade relations between two countries so situated geographically should be to give play to productive forces as far as practicable, regardless of political boundaries. While equivalency should be sought in an arrangement of this character, an exact balance of financial gain is neither imperative nor attainable. No yardstick can measure the benefits to the two peoples of this freer commercial intercourse and no trade agreement should be judged wholly by custom house statistics.
We have reached a stage in our own development that calls for a statesmanlike and broad view of our future economic status and its requirements. We have drawn upon our natural resources in such a way as to invite attention to their necessary limit. This has properly aroused effort to conserve them, to avoid their waste, and to restrict their use to our necessities. We have so increased in population and in our consumption of food products and the other necessities of life, hitherto supplied largely from our own country, that unless we materially increase our production we can see before us a change in our economic position, from that of a country selling to the world food and natural products of the farm and forest, to one consuming and importing them. Excluding cotton, which is exceptional, a radical change is already shown in our exports in the falling off in the amount of our agricultural products sold abroad and a corresponding marked increase in our manufactures exported. A farsighted policy requires that if we can enlarge our supply of natural resources, and especially of food products and the necessities of life, without substantial injury to any of our producing and manufacturing classes, we should take steps to do so now. We have on the north of us a country contiguous to ours for three thousand miles, with natural resources of the same character as ours which have not been drawn upon as ours have been, and in the development of which the conditions as to wages and character of the wage earner and transportation to market differ but little from those prevailing with us. The difference is not greater than it is between different States of our own country or between different Provinces of the Dominion of Canada. Ought we not, then, to arrange a commercial agreement with Canada, if we can, by which we shall have direct access to her great supply of natural products without an obstructing or prohibitory tariff? This is not a violation of the protective principle, as that has been authoritatively announced by those who uphold it, because that principle does not call for a tariff between this country and one whose conditions as to production, population, and wages are so like ours, and when our common boundary line of three thousand miles in itself must make a radical distinction between our commercial treatment of Canada and of any other country.
The Dominion has greatly prospered. It has an active, aggressive, and intelligent people. They are coming to the parting of the ways. They must soon decide, whether they are to regard themselves as isolated permanently from our markets by a perpetual wall or whether we are to be commercial friends. If we give them reason to take the former view, can we complain if they adopt methods denying access to certain of their natural resources except upon conditions quite unfavorable to us? A notable instance of such a possibility may be seen in the conditions surrounding the supply of pulp wood and the manufacture of print paper, for which we have made a conditional provision in the agreement, believed to be equitable. Should we not now, therefore, before their policy has become too crystallized and fixed for change, meet them in a spirit of real concession, facilitate commerce between the two countries, and thus greatly increase the natural resources available to our people?
I do not wish to hold out the prospect that the unrestricted interchange of food products will greatly and at once reduce their cost to the people of this country. Moreover, the present small amount of Canadian surplus for export as compared with that of our own production and consumption would make the reduction gradual. Excluding the element of transportation, the price of staple food products, especially of cereals, is much the same the world over, and the recent increase in price has been the result of a world-wide cause. But a source of supply as near as Canada would certainly help to prevent speculative fluctuations, would steady local price movements, and would postpone the effect of a further world increase in the price of leading commodities entering into the cost of living, if that be inevitable.
In the reciprocal trade agreement numerous additions are made to the free list. These include not only food commodities, such as cattle, fish, wheat and other grains, fresh vegetables, fruits, and dairy products, but also rough lumber and raw materials useful to our own industries. Free lumber we ought to have. By giving our people access to Canadian forests we shall reduce the consumption of our own, which, in the hands of comparatively few owners, now have a value that requires the enlargement of our available timber resources.
Natural, and especially food, products being placed on the free list, the logical development of a policy of reciprocity in rates on secondary food products, or foodstuffs partly manufactured, is, where they cannot also be entirely exempted from duty, to lower the duties in accord with the exemption of the raw material from duty. This has been followed in the trade agreement which has been negotiated. As an example, wheat is made free and the rate on flour is equalized on a lower basis. In the same way, live animals being made free, the duties on fresh meats and on secondary meat products and on canned meats are substantially lowered. Fresh fruits and vegetables being placed on the free list, the duties on canned goods of these classes are reduced.
Both countries in their industrial development have to meet the competition of lower priced labor in other parts of the world. Both follow the policy of encouraging the development of home industries by protective duties within reasonable limits. This has made it difficult to extend the principle of reciprocal rates to many manufactured commodities, but after much negotiation and effort we have succeeded in doing so in various and important instances.
The benefit to our widespread agricultural implement industry from the reduction of Canadian duties in the agreement is clear. Similarly the new, widely distributed and expanding motor vehicle industry of the United States is given access to the Dominion market on advantageous terms.
My purpose in making a reciprocal trade agreement with Canada has been not only to obtain one which would be mutually advantageous to both countries, but one which also would be truly national in its scope as applied to our own country and would be of benefit to all sections. The currents of business and the transportation facilities that will be established forward and back across the border cannot but inure to the benefit of the boundary States. Some readjustments may be needed, but in a very short period the advantage of the free commercial exchange between communities separated only by short distances will strikingly manifest itself. That the broadening of the sources of food supplies, that the opening of the timber resources of the Dominion to our needs, that the addition to the supply of raw materials, will be limited to no particular section does not require demonstration. The same observation applies to the markets which the Dominion offers us in exchange. As an illustration, it has been found possible to obtain free entry into Canada for fresh fruits and vegetables--a matter of special value to the South and to the Pacific coast in disposing of their products in their season. It also has been practicable to obtain free entry for the cottonseed oil of the South-- a most important product with a rapidly expanding consumption in the Dominion.
The entire foreign trade of Canada in the last fiscal year, 1910, was $655,000,000. The imports were $376,000,000, and of this amount the United States contributed more than $223,000,000. The reduction in the duties imposed by Canada will largely increase this amount and give us even a larger share of her market than we now enjoy, great as that is.
The data accompanying the text of the trade agreement exhibit in detail the facts which are here set forth briefly and in outline only. They furnish full information on which the legislation recommended may be based. Action on the agreement submitted will not interfere with such revision of our own tariff on imports from all countries as Congress may decide to adopt.
Reciprocity with Canada must necessarily be chiefly confined in its effect on the cost of living to food and forest products. The question of the cost of clothing as affected by duty on textiles and their raw materials, so much mooted, is not within the scope of an agreement with Canada, because she raises comparatively few wool sheep, and her textile manufactures are unimportant.
This trade agreement, if entered into, will cement the friendly relations with the Dominion which have resulted from the satisfactory settlement of the controversies that have lasted for a century, and further promote good feeling between kindred peoples. It will extend the market for numerous products of the United States among the inhabitants of a prosperous neighboring country with an increasing population and an increasing purchasing power. It will deepen and widen the sources of food supply in contiguous territory, and will facilitate the movement and distribution of these foodstuffs.
The geographical proximity, the closer relation of blood, common sympathies, and identical moral and social ideas furnish very real and striking reasons why this agreement ought to be viewed from a high plane.
Since becoming a nation, Canada has been our good neighbor, immediately contiguous across a wide continent without artificial or natural barrier except navigable waters used in common.
She has cost us nothing in the way of preparations for defense against her possible assault, and she never will. She has sought to agree with us quickly when differences have disturbed our relations. She shares with us common traditions and aspirations. I feel I have correctly interpreted the wish of the American people by expressing in the arrangement now submitted to Congress for its approval, their desire for a more intimate and cordial relationship with Canada. I therefore earnestly hope that the measure will be promptly enacted into law.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-10-12,"Whoa, whoa. It's great to be back in Ohio. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. This is a truly great state with thousands of hard-working, wonderful, beautiful American patriots. Beautiful. Under Republican leadership, America is being respected again. And all of those thousands of people that aren't under the shell that is standing out there, look at you.
Look at you. They're getting very wet. Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. There are thousands of people that can't see a thing. In other words, you're better at real estate than they are, but that's OK. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I'm really proud to report that earlier today we secured the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey.
He is now free from jail and he is in the air, heading to Germany, where he'll get off for a brief check, and I think he's going to be in great shape. And then he's coming to Washington, D.C., tomorrow, and we'll say hello to him. Went through a lot, you know? All about Pastor Brunson. He went through a lot, but he's on his way back.
We've done that with a lot, right? We've had a lot of success. North Korea, Egypt, remember? We bring a lot of people back, and that's good. They want to come back to our country, and they're coming back to our country. Tonight, every American heart is with our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Michael.
Sounds like a very nice name. That was a vicious hurricane. Whether it's in Florida or Georgia or Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, a lot of areas affected, but we just want to give everybody our love. That was a devastating power that hit -- among the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit our country.
It was devastating. But they'll rebuild. They're strong. They're great people. And just God bless you all. Thank you. My administration has been in constant communication with the state and local authorities all over the various states. When we're in trouble, we pull together, we pull together like nobody.
We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary achievements that we've made together in -- can you believe it -- less than two years? It's been Republican leadership and we are here to make sure that our amazing progress continues full speed ahead. Because America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning, really winning again.
And we are viewing now for the first time in many decades a phenomenon called so simply America first. And it's about time. It's about time. Right? About time. It's about time. The unemployment rate has just fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years. Manufacturing confidence just announced has reached an all-time high.
Think what that matters. Think what that is, confidence, confidence. The people of Ohio have confidence. Can tell you that. No, but think of it. If you remember the previous administration said manufacturing jobs... Other than that, you like them very much, right? But remember, they said manufacturing jobs, they're gone, they're dead.
Remember the expression, you'd need a magic wand to bring them -- bring them back? We're bringing them back. I guess we have the magic wand. They're coming back. And they're coming back from Mexico, they're coming back from Canada, they're coming back from everywhere, because they all want to be where the action is. They all want to be in the USA.
That's where we want to be. That's where the jobs are. We are now the hottest country anywhere in the world. All across... This crowd is incredible. Look at the cameras back there. It's like the Academy Awards. Look at this. How would you like to have to do this every night?
No, no, how would you like to have to do this every night? And one little mistake, one little mistake and they try to destroy your entire career. Boy. No, I mean, look at this. Seriously, look at -- look at the magnitude of it. Look at the number of the media back there. Look at that. Fake news. Fake news.
Fake. You go back and they'll say, did he say -- did he say this? Or that? Or this? That's OK. You know what, we've learned how to live with them. We've learned how to live with them. We don't like it, but we've learned. All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening, and we are putting our coal miners back to work.
One of the things we're most proud of - look, steel was dead. Steel was dead. I came into office, steel was a dead business. Now they're opening up plans, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're opening up plants all over the country, big ones, new ones. We're taxing the hell out of the dumpers. You know, you had the dumpers that were hurting your steel industry?
And you know what happens? After the industry dies -- would have died within two years. After it dies, they would come in and they would charge you three times more money. Nobody says it, but that's what happens. So we're going to have beautiful new American-made steel... It's not going to be mud or it's not going to be sand steel.
You know they put garbage in this stuff they were dumping. We don't even know what's in it. It's going to be U.S. steel. It's going to be American steel. We're going to get the iron ore from our mines, right, beautiful. They're opening up again. Our mines are opening up again. Metallurgic coal, but our miners are back to work.
We don't need outsiders telling us about our steel industry. It's incredible. Seriously, it's incredible what's happened. It's hot as a pistol. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, which is what we want. And this has been...
Really historic. And by the way, our magnificent first lady, Melania... just returned from an incredibly successful trip to Africa. It was an incredible trip. And she came back, and she told me so beautiful, so beautiful, and yet such incredible in some cases poverty. They need help. They definitely need help.
It's both beautiful and sad. It's got every kind of emotion. But you probably saw her travels. They were really incredible. And it opens your eyes to what's going on around the world. You're all very lucky in Ohio. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. Thank you. And on Monday night in the East Room of the White House, we achieved a tremendous victory for our nation, our freedom, and our Constitution.
America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Did he get treated badly and unfairly or what? Horrible. And I'll tell you what. He's done us a tremendous service, what -- the way they treated him, I've never seen anybody treated like that.
But he's done us a great service, because we are more energized as Republicans that ever -- I think ever before. I think ever before. We just got poll numbers for some of the Senate races. And you look at some of these Senate races where we weren't even going to contest. It's a Democrat that's in. We were figuring in -- you know, we're winning with candidates that are -- we're winning.
We're beating people that we weren't going to contest. So it's been amazing. Because people realize how important the Supreme Court is. And we could have two, three, maybe even four more choices, and we have to be able to get the votes to put them through. Go out and vote November 6th. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was announced, an angry Democrat mob was on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy him.
And before they even know -- I'll tell you, you saw it. Before they knew his name, they were saying horrible things. They didn't even know who was going to be the pick. He wasn't picked. I didn't know who was going to be the pick. And they were saying horrible, horrible things. These are bad people. We can't let this happen to our country.
Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. That's what it is. It's a mob. The people of Ohio can save America from radical Democrats. They've become radicalized. I mean, Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, seriously... No, no, seriously, she's becoming mainstream. You believe that one? We have to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate.
We need the votes. We need the votes. And, by the way, for the people of Ohio, early voting starts right now. You got to get out. Vote early. And then anybody that votes early, you can leave. The hell with you. That's -- you know, I worked in Cincinnati, Ohio, two summers. I loved Ohio. I loved Ohio. I shouldn't tell you this, but I used to travel a lot to Kentucky.
Does anybody travel to Kentucky? Right? No, I -- I like Kentucky. But I traveled to Kentucky when I spent a lot of time in the Queen City. I love the Queen City. We had a job, Swifton Village, Swifton. Does anyone ever hear of Swifton? And it was a great experience. It was a successful experience. I did it with my father, one of my earliest things that I've done, and I guess it's sort of like if you get your first up as a hit, you're a hitter, you hit, you sink the 10-foot putt on the first hole.
But we had a great success in Ohio, and I've never forgotten it. And then they said -- remember, for months before the election, you cannot win without getting the great state of Ohio. Right? And I got the great state of Ohio. And I love the great state of Ohio. We got it. We got it. Remember? They used to say that every time.
I used to hear it. I have fantastic people in Ohio that did a job for me. Bob Paduchik, where's Bob? I had just a great group of people. They did incredible work. But they constantly would say on these phony networks, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. And then they started doing polls, and I was way up. And I think we won it by 9 or 10 points.
A lot. We won it by a lot. In fact, you know the way, if it's close, they have to take hours and hours and hours, right? So with Ohio, I'll never forget, they said the polls have closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. Crazy. We won Ohio by so much that it took one second before they called it, OK? We won by a lot.
It's a great place. And by the way, have I produced? Look at what's coming into Ohio now. Have we produced? I produced and you produced. If Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take control, they will try to raise your taxes, impose socialism on this country, take away your health care, and take away your jobs.
We have more people working now than ever before. They want to take away -- that's what will happen. The Democrats want to erase America's borders and let drugs, gangs and crime pour into our country. In fact, I've been going around lately saying the Democrats are the party of crime. And nobody even challenges me, not even the fake news media.
They don't even challenge me. Republicans are the party of safety and Republicans are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. And that's what's happened. And we're honored to be joined tonight by many terrific Ohio Republicans, including Republican Party Chair -- I have to say, this woman is incredible, because, you know, I got dropped just before the election by the head of the Republican Party.
I've never been dropped in my life. And a woman came in who is a very successful person with a great family. And she took that thing over. What a job she's done. Her name is Jane Timken, and she is very special. Where's Jane? She's incredible. Thank you very much. And a man who said, oh, you're going to win, you're going to win, and I said, well, how do you know?
So I had five people to choose from to head up my campaign in Ohio. And one name, I don't know, I liked the name, I liked the sound of it, his name was Bob Paduchik. Why do I like that name? Why? It's not outstanding. But he came in and he did a job, and I had the support of the people, but not the support of a lot of others.
And he just said, you're going to win. And every time I called him up and say, you know, this happened, that happened, he said, that's OK, you're going to win by more. This guy's the most positive guy. So I want to thank Bob Paduchik. So good that we moved him over to the RNC, but, Bob, in about a year from now, get ready.
You're coming back here. Thank you, Bob. And we have a friend of mine who's an incredibly respected man in the United States Senate. When he speaks, we all listen, including the president. He really is. He's a great, great guy. He's loved in Ohio. Senator Rob Portman. Where is he? Thank you. He's a respected guy.
Thank you, Rob. Congressman Warren Davidson and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, thank you. Thank you, fellas. Great job. So many things we passed in Congress. Those two guys were there with us. Thank you very much. What a job they've done. We're also joined by your next lieutenant governor Jon Husted. Jon, thank you.
Thank you, Jon. And I hear you're up a little bit, Jon. We've got to get that over, because you're going against a very bad guy. I'll tell you, he's a bad guy. And everybody -- I'll tell you, Jon is with a friend of mine, and they decided to get together, which is very smart. Instead of going like this to each other, they got together, and Jon is running with your next governor, Mike DeWine... And Mike and Jon are running against Elizabeth Warren's far-left disciple, Richard Cordray.
Jon, am I allowed to say some bad things about Cordray? Because let me tell you, he did such a bad job at the agency that he ran. It was terrible. He was hurting people. And I think he enjoyed it. No, really. I really believe he enjoyed it. He was putting people out of business. They weren't loaning money to the people that they were supposed to. It was terrible.
Cordray spent $250 million federal dollars trying to renovate a headquarters, his agency, that they didn't even own, more than twice what the entire building was worth. They didn't own it. And then it became a big scandal. But because it was a Democrat, the fake news didn't want to write about it. Then after spending like $50 million on some elevators, it turned out that they didn't work.
If Cordray were ever -- and I'll tell you what, this is a Pocahontas dream to get this guy elected. I've done a lot for the steel industry. More than anybody's done in many, many -- I mean, you speak to U.S. Steel, they'll tell you.
A lot for the miners, a lot for everybody. This guy does not belong in the state, folks. OK? First of all, he's a super liberal. Why do you do that? Why do you do that -- is he -- OK, go with DeWine, please. And Jon. Cordray would be an absolute disaster for Ohio. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
I couldn't wait to get him out. We tried so hard. You know, you had one of these deals that you couldn't get him out. But we tried so hard. And they've done such a great job since we got him out. He was bad. You don't need him in Ohio. Now, I'm thrilled to introduce the next United States senator from Ohio, Jim Renacci, who's a great guy and a great friend of mine.
Jim, come up. Come up. Come. This is a good man. Nothing's easy about politics, but I'll tell you what, he's in there fighting, and just get out and vote for him. He is a good, good friend of mine and a good man.
Thank you. Thanks, Jim. It is true. Sherrod Brown's never voting for us. He didn't vote for anything that we want. Yet I hear he goes around -- he does the best commercials. In fact, I just want to think, is he a Republican? He's doing these commercials that he likes Donald Trump. He'll never vote for us. He didn't vote for Justice Kavanaugh.
He didn't vote for tax cuts. He doesn't vote for us, folks. I mean, it might be nice for him to say he agrees with my economic policy when he's never going to vote for it. So you're just kidding yourself. He voted yes on amnesty for illegal aliens. He voted yes on deadly sanctuary cities. We started building the wall, and we've made progress, but he voted against it.
A border wall, which is moving faster than anybody would believe... is truly a life-saving barrier against deadly floods of drugs, crime, smugglers, traffickers, cartels. Our brave border agents want a wall. They need a wall. It's happening. It's moving. We have made so much progress. We will finish the wall.
If you want more jobs and less crime, if you want to stop Schumer from running the Senate... we need the vote of Jim Renacci. We do. Jim is a good person. He's a great guy. We need his vote! You know they say we have a majority. But if somebody has a cold, they can't come in, we don't have a majority anymore.
We got to get people. We've got to get some Republicans so we can vote. Finally, it's my privilege to introduce a tremendous Ohio Republican. We're here for him tonight. A great friend of mine, he's fought so hard for everything we've done. He's a true fighter for the state, Congressman Steve Chabot. Great guy.
Come up, Steve. Come up, Steve.
Thank you, Steve. So just remember, a vote for Steve Chabot is a vote to protect your family, your jobs, and your country. Now, Steve's winning. Nice poll numbers. But don't take any chances. Get out and vote, please, OK? No chances. We don't want to hear about any upsets. He's a great, great guy. If you want to stop the radical Democrats, if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker -- can you believe it -- and you have to get out and vote for Steve.
Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats have signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care that would utterly destroy Medicare and Rob our seniors of the benefits they paid into their entire lives. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they've paid for it. And the Democrats want radical socialism, and they want open borders where everybody pours into our country.
It's what they want. I don't get it, but that's what they want. Does anybody want that? Open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. Think of that. I'll tell you what, the incredible men and women of ICE are not treated properly. They're not treated properly. They do an incredible job.
The Democrats want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and anybody else that wants to come in. We're not going to have it. We're not going to have it. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. This election is about safety and is about prosperity.
Since the election, which is incredible. If I would have said this, I've been to Ohio so many times, been to every part of Ohio. The people are great. But if I would have said this, the fake news would have said, how dare he say that. Since the election, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs... and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
Big deal. That's a big deal. We've added nearly 600,000 brand-new beautiful manufacturing jobs. Right? African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in the history of our country. And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever, lowest rate ever. My -- that's a big number, right?
How do they beat that number? How does anybody beat that number? We're going to have these people come in. For over 100 years, they've claimed and they've wanted and they've said -- they've lied to African-Americans. Remember my statement, what do you have to lose? Guess what? They all believe it now. What do you have to lose?
They're doing -- we are doing great as a country. But I'm so proud -- I am so proud of the kind of numbers you're hearing. My administration is fighting every day to deliver safety, opportunity, and justice for everybody, for everybody. We're asking as an example all African-American voters to honor us with their support this November.
Get away from the Democrats. Get away from the Democrats. They've done nothing. They've done nothing. Think of it. We have the best numbers in history on employment and unemployment and median income and many other things. And I think we're going to get the African-American vote. And it's true. Kanye West, what he did was pretty amazing yesterday.
Pretty amazing. And you know who else was with him? A guy you know well, big Jim Brown. Big Jim. What do you think Big Jim would be making today in the NFL? He was unstoppable, right? Unstoppable Jim Brown. He was a great football player and is an even greater man. He's great. Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans likewise have the lowest unemployment in the history of our country.
And women unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is soon to be changed to historic levels, but right now, I'm sorry, it's the lowest in 65 years, OK? Sorry! Sorry, women! I let the women down. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning, right? Tired of winning. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horrendous NAFTA -- NAFTA was a disaster, folks -- NAFTA was a disaster -- with the incredible, brand-new, U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the USMCA.
It's opening up Canada, opening up Mexico for our farmers, our -- everybody. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's unfair trade actions and trade abuses. And thanks to our tariff, and especially on steel that's been dumped all over this country, the Ohio steel industry and the U.S. steel industry is roaring back to life and soon will be hitting its most successful years ever.
Very serious. And you see it. You see it all over this state. Under Republican leadership, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. And by the way, Sherrod Brown voted against them. We reduced high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent during my first year and now they're dropping much lower than that.
And I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress -- thanks to Rob Portman and a lot of others -- thank you, Rob -- but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support. We also passed veterans' choice, the V.A. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor and the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans, who we couldn't fire, we couldn't do anything about it, we now look at them and say, Jim, you're fired.
Out. Get out. True. True. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion for the second year to fully rebuild the American military, which had to happen. We needed it. And much less importantly, when it comes to the military, every bit of equipment is being built in the USA. That's the only place where jobs are secondary.
Number one, we needed the equipment. But it's all being built here. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force. Very important. Very important. That's very important. Hate to say it, but very soon, that's where it's going to be at. It's going to be space, everything, defense, offense, everything.
And we have tremendous support from Rob and the Senate. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal, and look what happened to Iran. You know, when I took office, Iran was all over the place. They were taking over Syria. They were taking over Yemen. They were taking over everything.
I actually said, this is going to be a problem, and we've got to do something. And about four months ago, we withdrew from that horrible, ridiculous deal. And you take a look what's happening to Iran. There's riots all over the streets, all over the cities. It's a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different country.
And it's looking real good. Looking real good. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and reopened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together, we've made unbelievable progress, and we're just getting started. We have so many other things. If you vote to elect Republican House, Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially.
We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. The Democrats cannot do it. We will continue to confirm judges who interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass case law, crack down on sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery and chain migration, defend the ballot box for American citizens, and throw vicious MS-13 gangs the hell out of our country, like we're doing right now.
You know, I say it to people, MS-13 gang, vicious, horrible people. We're throwing them out of here by the thousands. But you know who's doing it? Do we love law enforcement or what? But you know who's... But ICE, in Long Island, where I sort of grew up -- I was right next to these areas. I know them so well.
You had towns that were practically taken over by MS-13. And ICE goes in like it's a day in the office. And they're tougher and smarter that these wise guys. And they start throwing them in the paddy wagon, throwing them in, get the hell out of here. And you know what? The towns are liberated. The people are clapping from windows.
The people are clapping all over the streets. These towns, like a country that was invaded and taken over and then was liberated. These towns are being liberated of the MS-13 garbage that came into our country. Under the previous administration, by the way. And they came in by the tens of thousands -- well, we have set every record on getting them out.
And I want to tell you, there's nothing that gives me more pleasure. And for all of the companies that are moving back in to the United States, we will finally have a merit-based system of immigration. Not just lump -- not a lottery, pick them out of a hat. Who the hell are they? Who is he? Pick them out of a hat.
We're letting people come in on merit, where they can help you, where they can help these companies grow. Right now, we have a system, lottery, a lottery. Think of it, lottery. Oh, pick 'em, I wonder? What people do you think these countries are putting in? Do you think they're putting in their finest? I don't think so. I don't think so. So we're going to end it. We're going to have a merit-based system.
Bring them in through merit. We're lifting millions of people from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. And you see that happening. But to achieve this, you have to get out November 6th or vote early and vote Republican. We need the votes. We have to have those votes. For years and years, you've watched as your leaders apologized for America.
They apologized for America. Now you finally have a president who is standing up for America. Look at the people out there. It's amazing.
Look, they never turn the cameras. I go home, I say to my wife, how did the crowd look? They only show your face. They never move the camera. But you know what? She can tell by the sound, because... True. She can tell by the sound, because, you know, if you have, like, let's say, one of the normal presidents walk in. We've had a lot of normals.
And some great ones. You'd have, what, 300 people show up. But you can tell by the sound, because 300 people cannot make the sound of thousands and thousands and tens of thousands like that. They can't do it. So even though they refuse -- you know, normally I'd like it, but I don't. They don't want to move the camera.
The only ones that become famous are about six people right behind me. No, but, honestly, you know, I know what stadiums sound like, and this sounds like on television we're in the middle of an Ohio State football game.
It's what it sounds like. It's what it sounds like. And speaking of Ohio State -- they're not doing too badly, are they, huh? Great coach. You have a great coach, great guy. Great guy. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Ohio. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. But to continue our momentum, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and vote Republican, vote early or on November 6th, vote Republican.
Vote for Steve Chabot, Jim Renacci. Vote for DeWine. We need DeWine. We got to have DeWine. Where the hell is Jon? Are you over there, Jon? He's still here. He'll never leave. You got to vote. We need a governor here -- you cannot let this happen to Ohio. This Democrat is a disaster. A proven disaster. Vote DeWine.
He's a good man, and a good man, too. You've got two good men. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, more products made right now in the USA, which is what we're all about. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement.
Thank you, law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division. You've seen that. You just saw it with a high-quality, highest quality, this incredible man. You saw it. Brett Kavanaugh, you saw it, what they did to him and his family. And his young, beautiful daughters.
Right? Da Nang Dick, Da Nang Dick, how about Da Nang? Da Nang Dick. Cory Booker, he ran Newark into the ground. Senator Dianne Feinstein, how about that? How about that? Seriously. Who thinks... She was very unprepared for that question.
No, I didn't -- she was very unprepared, right? Very unprepared. Dianne Feinstein. You know, what they did to this man, he will go down along with Justice Gorsuch -- and, by the way, how good is Clarence Thomas? How good? How good? He's going to go down as one of your greats. It's up to the people in this incredible -- I don't know if you call it a room.
I don't know what the hell it is. All I know -- is this a room or a roof? I think it's a roof. Whatever it is, there are a lot of people. But it's up to you, folks. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. So we had the greatest movement in the history of our country.
We really did. We really did. You know, they can say what they want, but nobody even challenges it. You know, I'll say that a lot. And usually, if there's, like, a 2 percent variation, the fake news will hit me the next day. Trump exaggerated or something. Actually, we've under-exaggerated, because we've produced more than I ever promised during the campaign.
More. But we had the greatest -- but look at the -- look at this. Look at this group. We had the greatest -- and we never -- by the way, I hate to disappoint you, but we went to Mississippi, we went to Missouri, we went to Nevada, we went to -- every place, and we have crowds, we have tens of thousands of people outside of every arena.
They have to start building larger arenas in this country, right? Something is happening. And I saw this in the election. We'd go -- I'll never forget -- we went to Michigan, final stop. I got there 1 o'clock in the morning. There was actually Election Day, 1 o'clock in the morning. There were 32,000 people.
I see some people there, they were there. It was unbelievable, 32,000 people. I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. I got home at 4 o'clock in the morning. And I said, you know, we had 32,000. Crooked Hillary had, like, 500. And I said, why aren't we going to win the great state of Michigan? And guess what?
We did. We did. And it hadn't been won in decades by a Republican. And now they like me even more. You know why? Because car companies are moving plants back in. And just so you don't feel too lonely, they're moving the plants back into Ohio also. A lot of them. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country.
And together we are taking back our country. We're returning the power back to the incredible American people. Ohio is the state that gave us a great president who hasn't been properly recognized, OK? William McKinley has not been properly recognized. What he did in terms of trade, in terms of war, but in terms of trade -- and I hate to say, in terms of being smart in tariffs, William McKinley has not been properly recognized.
But maybe someday he will. It also gave you a general, who was incredible. He drank a little bit too much. You know who I'm talking about, right? So Robert E. Lee was a great general. And Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia. He couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. He was going crazy. I don't know if you know this story.
But Robert E. Lee was winning battle after battle after battle. And Abraham Lincoln came home, he said, I can't beat Robert E. Lee. And he had all of these generals. They look great. They were the top of their class at West Point. They were the greatest people. There was only one problem. They didn't how the hell to win.
They didn't know how to fight. They didn't know how. And one day, it was looking really bad. And Lincoln just said, you -- hardly knew his name -- and they said, don't take him. He's got a drinking problem. And Lincoln said, I don't care what problem he has, you guys aren't winning. And his name was Grant.
General Grant. And he went in and he knocked the hell out of everyone. And you know the story. They said to Lincoln, you can't use him anymore. He's an alcoholic. And Lincoln said, I don't care if he's an alcoholic. Frankly, give me six or seven more just like him. He started to win. Grant really did. He had a serious problem.
Serious drinking problem. But, man, was he a good general. And he's finally being recognized as a great general. But Lincoln had almost developed a phobia, because he was having a hard time with a true great fighter and a great general, Robert E. Lee. But Grant figured it out, and Grant is a great general, and Grant came from right here.
Ulysses S. Grant. Ohio is the state that gave us the Wright Brothers. It gave us Neil Armstrong. He's the man that planted the flag -- think of that -- on the face of the moon. Who's that? Who are they -- a relative of -- oh, that's nice. They weren't worried about not planting a flag, right? You know them.
He planted that flag, that American flag right on the face of the moon. There was no kneeling. There was no nothing. There was no games. There was no games. Boom. Wrong, right? Right, fellas? My military guys up here. Of course, my -- excuse me. Excuse me. My military folks all over this arena. And how do you like the fact that the V.A. now has choice, right?
I said it. But, you know, I skip over it. For 44 years, they've been trying to get choice, and we got it done. That means instead of waiting for 10 days or 5 days or 22 days or 33 days, or 2 months, our great veterans, some of them would be fine, just not feeling so good by the time they saw the doctor. It took so long, they would have a terminal illness.
That's how bad it was. And I got done what they'd been trying to do for 44 years, I think. Forty-four years. Now when they have to wait, they go out, they get the services of a good private doctor, we pay the bill, and they're all better, and that's nice. Forty-four years. It took 44 years to get that done.
I'm just saying that because I see these great military guys. That's pretty much appreciated, fellas, right? That's a big difference. It's a big difference. Made a lot of people very happy. Probably cost us less money. I don't care about that in this case. I care about taking care of our veterans. It's about time.
Generations of Ohio workers farm the fields, poured the incredible steel, fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world. We lost our way. But now we've gained our way back again, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. These courageous Ohio patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage.
We didn't do that. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. That's all we're going to do is win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down.
We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-04-07,"I just want to say that President Xi and all of his representatives have been really interesting to be with. I think we have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China. My representatives have been meeting one-on-one with their counterparts from China. And, it's I think, truly, progress has been made. We'll be making a lot of additional progress.
The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding. We look forward to being together many times in the future. And I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.
So I just want to thank President Xi for being with us in the United States. It's a tremendous honor for me and all of my representatives to host the President and his representatives. And again, progress has been made. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Well, I agree 100 percent, Mr. President. And thank you very much. And again, a tremendous honor to have you in the United States and in Mar-a-Lago. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump at Bilateral Meeting with Xi Jinping,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-meeting-xi-jinping-april-7-2017
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-10-03,"Well, thank you very much. It was a great trip and a beautiful place. I've been to Puerto Rico many times as, I think, most of you have known. And I've always loved it. And your weather is second to none, but every once in a while you get hit. And you really got hit -- there's no question about it.
I want to thank, in particular, some of the folks that come here where really great danger was involved, right at the beginning. I have to start with Brock. Where's Brock? Brock -- Brock Long has been through a lot.
We gave him an A-plus in Texas. We thought he could rest for a couple of days, but before he got any rest, he had Florida, right? And you had Louisiana, and you had other places. And, by the way, Louisiana -- we don't say it often -- but Louisiana got hit very hard also, and they've been fantastic.
But then he came to Florida, and that we gave him another A-plus.
And then, all of a sudden, we said there's another one heading out to Puerto Rico and to the U.S. Virgin Islands. But it wasn't one -- it was two.
And I was going to be here a week ago, if you remember, and that was the day of the hurricane -- that was the day of the second hurricane.
So Brock has been unbelievable. And this has been the toughest one. This has been a Category 5, which few people have ever even heard of -- a Category 5 hitting land.
But it hit land -- and, boy, did it hit land.
So I want to thank you. I want to thank Elaine. Elaine, thank you very much.
Fantastic -- Acting Secretary. Elaine Duke has been incredible. Tom Bossert is here someplace.
Tom, great job. Great job.
And to all of my people -- and I have to say, General Buchanan got here a few days ago, and there's no doubt about it you are a general. There's a reason you're a general, right? But he's no games. I said, give me a general; I don't want to have any -- I don't want to have a general that plays games.
And you've done a fantastic job. The whole team has been amazing.
vour governor has been -- who I didn't know; I heard very good things about him. He's not even from my party, and he started right at the beginning appreciating what we did. And he was tremendously supportive, and he knew the level of problem that you had at the beginning, before, and the level -- what happened with respect to the tremendous storms that hit your beautiful island.
And, Governor, I just want to tell you that, right from the beginning, this governor did not play politics. He didn't play it at all. He was saying it like it was, and he was giving us the highest grades.
And I want to -- on behalf of our country, I want to thank you.
I also want to thank your congresswoman, who actually represents the largest number of people of any congressperson in the United States. I know that. It's 3.5 million people, Jenniffer, right? So Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón, who I've watched the other day and she was saying such nice things about all of the people that have worked so hard.
Jenniffer, do you think you could say a little bit what you said about us today? And it's not about me, it's about these incredible people, from the military to FEMA, to first responders. I mean, I've never seen people working so hard in my life. Perhaps you could say, Congresswoman?
Well, I want to thank you because you were really generous. And I saw those comments, and everybody saw those comments, and we really appreciate it.
And, you know, it's so important, when you have men and women that have worked so hard and so long, and many of them came from two other catastrophic hurricanes. They came from Texas, they came from Louisiana, they came from Florida, and there was no -- how many nights' rest have you gotten? Zero in the last month, right?
Well, we're going to keep them for another couple of weeks. And by that time, I think -- well -- come here. Special guy, I will tell you -- special.
Really good.
I also -- in addition to Tom, I also want to thank Linda McMahon, Small Business. I always joke -- I said, she's in charge of small business, but small business is massive business when you add it all up. And she has done an incredible job -- built a great company with her husband, Vince McMahon.
And I wanted her so badly for this position because there's nobody that knows how to build a company like those and, let me tell you, like this woman. She has been amazing in business, and now she's doing an incredible job as the Administrator. We want to thank you, Linda, very much.
And Mick Mulvaney is here -- right there -- and Mick is in charge of a thing called ""budget."""" Now
If you look at the -- every death is a horror. But if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering -- nobody has ever seen anything like this. What is your death count, as of this moment -- 17?
Sixteen people certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together.
Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taken place in Puerto Rico.
I also want to pay a very special thanks to the Navy. Who's here from the Navy? Who do we have, General? Who do we have? What a job. So you have ships all over the place? I saw them flying in.
I said, boy, this looks like very big stuff. And the job you've done getting things here. There are no docks.
There have been -- we're just in the process of opening them up. They were just devastated. But there are no docks, no nothing.
And the way you got this stuff on shore is incredible.
So I want to thank the Navy. Would you like to say something on behalf of the Navy.
Thank you. And thank you very much. And I don't have to even mention the Marines because we have General Kelly. Where's General Kelly?
Where is our General Kelly? He likes to keep a low profile. Look at him sitting in the back, but, boy, is he watching. You have no idea how he's -- General Kelly, come up here. So General Kelly is a four-star. Not a bad general, right? You don't get any better than General Kelly.
But on behalf of the Marines, I'll tell you, they've done some job, General.
Now, can we also mention Army? And can we also mention some people that I really got to know and respect even more in Texas, and that's the Coast Guard?
What a job the Coast Guard has done throughout this whole -- throughout this whole ordeal. I want to thank the Coast Guard.
They are special, special, very brave people.
And a lot of people got to see the real Coast Guard during this incredible trouble, and especially I think here and in Texas was incredible what they did. So thank you all very much. Thank you very much.
We appreciate it. Really appreciate it.
Would you like to say something on behalf of your men and women?
No, I know that.
And the runways now are pretty open?
Amazing job. Amazing job. So amazing that we're ordering hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of new airplanes for the Air Force, especially the F-35.
Do you like the F-35?
I said, how does it do it in fights? And how do they do in fights with the F-35? They said, we do very well. You can't see it. Literally you can't see it.
So it's hard to fight a plane that you can't see, right?
But that's an expensive plane that you can't see. And as you probably heard, we cut the price very substantially -- something that other administrations would never have done, that I can tell you. So thank you very much.
Where is the Coast Guard? Who can speak on behalf of the Coast Guard? Who can speak? Where is our Coast Guard representative?
Come here, get over here. Come here, come here. On behalf of the Coast Guard, just say a few words.
Your people have been amazing. Go ahead.
Well, in Texas, it came in, it did devastation, then went right out into the coast, then it came in and out. It came in three times. It would load up with water and come in.
Nobody has ever seen water like that.
And the Coast Guard would follow it. It goes in, and they'd be right behind it, and then they'd move. They saved 16,000 lives in Texas.
Hard to believe -- between the helicopters and all of them. But the Coast Guard itself saved in Texas 16,000 lives, and they went right through that hurricane. And there aren't too many people who would have done it, believe me.
Would you thank everybody for me?
Say a few words. Please, say a few words. Customs and Border Protection, say a few words, please.
Don't be shy. What I would like to do -- you want to stand up? Go ahead. That's okay.
Stand up. Go ahead.
Okay. You did a great job. I just want to also add Rick Perry is here someplace.
Rick -- governor of Texas for many years, 14 years -- did a great job, head of Energy. And Scott Pruitt from Environmental is here and doing an amazing -- really an amazing job. We appreciate it, fellas.
Thank you very much. Governor, would you say a few words?
Thank you, Governor.
Well, thank you, everybody. And we're going to make some tours now if anybody has any questions or statements or anything. I know we have a lot of powerful people -- a lot of your heads of your Senate, the heads of your everything.
And it's an honor to work with you folks. And we'll all get it done together.
So I appreciate your support and I know you appreciate our support, because our country has really gone all out to help. And it's not only dangerous, it's expensive, it's everything. But I consider it a great honor, maybe because I know so many people from Puerto Rico that are such great people -- I come from New York.
But we've gone all out and I consider that, again, a great honor. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Okay. Thank you all. Let's go make a -- let's go see what we have. Let's go.

Donald Trump,United States of America,1993-10-05,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is an honor to be here, and I appreciate the time.
I had a rather long and probably very boring speech drawn out, and I have decided not to read this speech after having heard so much this morning. It was politically correct, it was something that was going to get me in no trouble whatsoever, but I just don't feel it is appropriate to go through it.
I think that it is obvious from everything you have heard today that organized crime is rampant, is rampant -- I don't mean a little bit -- is rampant on the Indian reservations. People know it; people talk about it.
I watched the FBI discussing the fact that they had virtually no agents checking, and I just wondered to myself, I wonder what J. Edgar Hoover would have said about this.
What is happening on the Indian reservations is known by the Indians to a large extent. I don't believe anything is being done about it. And, to be honest with you, I think if you knew some of the characters that you are dealing with, I think they would be afraid to do anything about it.
In Atlantic City and in Las Vegas we have the FBI, many, many folks from the FBI, we have our own people, we have the U.S. attorneys, we have sheriffs, we have marshals, we have everything watching every move.
As Congressman Torricelli said, they really know me better than I know myself, everybody, from the Casino Control Commission all the way up or down. It is really an incredible situation that I have to go through in terms of checks. Every check I sign, every document I sign is scrutinized by, not one, not two, but in many cases three, four, and five different groups of people, and in the end I am not saying that things can't be done wrong, I am not saying that things can't happen, but people are going to get caught; they are absolutely going to get caught.
I have witnessed so many different things, and I can't tell you. We have an industry in Atlantic City that has contributed $2.5 billion to the Casino Revenue Fund. That is a fund set up for senior citizens and the disabled. Two things can happen, and this is big money. This is, 9.25 percent of every dollar gets sent to the senior citizens and to the disabled in New Jersey and beyond, and beyond in terms of groups of people.
If this continues as a threat, it is my opinion that it will blow, it will blow sky high, it will be the biggest scandal ever or one of the biggest scandals since Al Capone in terms of organized crime, and it is going to destroy an industry that is a legitimate industry, an industry that is watched carefully by everybody. This will be a scandal. Congressman Miller, I believe, will be very embarrassed by it, I believe a lot of you folks that are standing there, I believe honestly knowing that what you say is perhaps not as correct as you would like to make it sound. I believe that there is going to be a lot of embarrassed and a lot of red faces.
But to sit here and listen as people are saying that there is no organized crime, that there is no money laundering, that there is no anything, and that an Indian chief is going to tell Joey Killer to please get off his reservation is almost unbelievable to me.
I listen about sovereign nation, the great sovereign nation, and yet $30 billion to all of the various programs was contributed to the sovereign nation for education, for welfare, for this, for that.
I listened as to sovereign nation, and yet the sovereign nation and the people of the sovereign nation have the right to vote in our country.
I listen as to sovereign nation, all of the medical, all of the other treaties.
I want to know, can Indians sign treaties with foreign nations? Can they go and sign a treaty with Germany? The answer is no. How is it a sovereign nation?
It is only a sovereign nation in that Indians don't have to pay tax, and what you have -- what you have is, you have a very interesting dichotomy. We are paying $2.5 billion worth of tax. The Indians don't have to pay tax. Nobody is more for the Indians than Donald Trump.
And you ask about competing. I love to compete. Nobody likes -- and I think many of you folks up there know for a fact that I love to compete. But I like to compete on an equal footing. I am competing and paying hundreds of millions of dollars in tax. My so-called -- as you would call them -- opponent -- and they are not an opponent -- but my opponent is competing and paying no tax. It is not a fair situation. It is not fair to the States.
If, in fact, Indian gaming were allowed in northern New Jersey, the Fund for Senior Citizens would be totally destroyed, the fund for medical care and all of the other uses that this tax money is paid for would be totally destroyed, and I think that is a real big problem.
And one other thing I might add. We talk about Indians like gaming is going to be the salvation. You have a group of Indians in Connecticut. I have heard 300, I have heard 400. It is a casino that is far and away the most profitable in the world because, again, they don't pay tax. Why don't they distribute some of the funds to all of the other Indians throughout the United States that don't have a location of Connecticut right next to New York City and right next to Boston?
Why is it that the Indians -- we talk about these 300 Indians which, by the way, was rather recently formed -- why don't they make their contributions to all of the Indians? You have probably a profit on that, I would estimate, of $400 or $500 million. This goes to a total of about 300 to 400 Indians. Why don't we make contributions? Why doesn't this money get taxed, and why doesn't this money be distributed throughout the United States to Indians who locationally can't have a reservation where you would have a casino because the casino is too far away from the population?
So I listened to what has gone on today, and truly I am amazed, and I am disappointed. I am disappointed as a citizen. When I have to sit here and listen to people saying that everything is just peachy-dory, it is not, folks. It is going to blow. It is just a question of time, and when it blows you are going to have a lot of very embarrassed faces sitting right where you folks are sitting right now.
Thank you very much.
. Chairman and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the privilege of appearing before you today on this important issue.
Thank you. Bob, for that warm introduction, and thank you for being here with me today. Your presence clearly indicates the importance of this matter to the people of New Jersey.
I'm Donald Trump. Tm from New York where I develop, restore and create new properties and hotels. As Bob Torricelli noted, I also operate three casinos in Atlantic City under license from the State of New Jersey and that is why I am here today. Those casinos have stockholders and bondholders other than myself. As Chairman of the Board of these casinos, I represem their interests as weU.
Much has been said in recent weeks about the big casino interests -- people like Donald Trump taking on America's native people. Trump and all the moneyed, muscle crowd attacking minorities. That isn't the case at all. In a sense, this has little to do with the Indians. Neither I nor my colleagues in the industry oppose the right of our first countrymen to seek economic determination and to secure their futures. As you know, many people in our industry are helping Indian tribes accomplish that goaL
I am not here to quarrel with Indians. But I and others do have a quarrel with the federal government And when it comes time for a single citizen to stand up to the power and resources of Washington, all of us, including Donald Trump, are just members of John Q. Public. A little guy against the biggies.
But America is a great country and even little guys, in this case even Donald Trump, have some rights. And states also have some rights in our constitutional system. We believe that in this case the rights of Donald Trump), the residents of New Jersey and the state itself are quite synonymous.
As stated, I operate three casinos in Atlantic City. Actually, although a lot of people seem to think I know little about the business, I am the largest individual casino operator in the world. I say that modestly as you would expect
However, in New Jersey, I and my colleagues don't merely operate casinos for our own fun and profit We are economic partners with the state. The first 9. This is a state program we fund which supports seniors and the disabled. It allows seniors to buy prescription drugs for $5.00, offsets their property taxes, helps reduce their electricity bills and provides other services like home health care. It offers our seniors and disabled both security and dignity.
In 1992 New Jersey casinos provided $255 million to this fund. Since 1978 when Atlantic City's first casino opened, our industry has provided S2ii billion to the CRF.
The next 1. We are the sole funding source of that organization. Last year we provided $40 million to the CRDA which invests these funds in public projects throughout New Jersey. Through 2009, it is estimated the CRDA will invest $654 million in Atlantic City, $413 million in southern New Jersey and $297 million in northern New Jersey. This money has and will continue to build housing, day care centers, senior citizen complexes and shopping centers in all of the state's urban areas. It's a lot of money, and it's for worthwhile causes.
Some 75,000 New Jerseyans and their families are working because of our business; more than 43,000 directly in Atlantic City. We employ well over half of the city's entire work force. In 1992 alone we paid more than a billion dollars in wages and benefits to our people.
More than $5 billion of investment, that's right $5 billion of private capital has made Atlantic City the economic base of the entire southern half of New Jersey. We represent over 4 percent of the state budget.
We have accomplished all this under the most restrictive regulatory standards in the country. We are the most highly regulated business in any capacity in any venue. We pay the state over $60 million annually for our own regulation. That's correct -- we pay to regulate ourselves although state regulation is separate and apart from us and beyond reproach.
As I said, our regulation is stiff. Each of my businesses is relicensed on a biannual basis. As of now, I must personally requalify each year. All key employees must do so. This is no easy process. Every activity and transaction are checked by the State Police. Some eighty pages of documentation; associations, personal and business checks; family background; and resources. It is totally pervasive. Actually, I am told that some of the owners of sports franchises in our country would not qualify for licensure in New Jersey casino industry.
I can state without fear that we are solid corporate citizens operating a clean and honest entertainment business. Both we and New Jersey are proud of this record and rightfully so.
Do you wonder, therefore, why we are so deeply concerned, even paranoid, that Indian tribe operations are not similarly regulated. Do you know what would happen to our reputations, our businesses if organized crime gained a foothold in any of the Indian operations. I am not suggesting that organized crime has done to although there have been numerous articles in the press that this has happened. It is the mere possibility that scares us. A scandal in any Indian casino operation would reflect on us, rub off on our industry. Our honesty, our integrity, our reputations would be compromised at once. It is an old story -- guilt by association. Years of work down the drain. We know that Indian tribes want clean and honest operations. However, we also know that people involved in advising some of the tribes, those operating and funding certain of their operations, are not subject to the strict licensing and qualifying regulations in place in New Jersey and other states. Yes, we are concerned, very concerned. The federal government has unleashed a process without regard to the economic or social consequences to the stau in which the activity takes place.
However, I am not in law enforcement so I will let the law enforcement people discuss these matters. I am here to talk about what could happen in New Jersey if this process were applied there. I would like to trace for you what would happen to us, our employees and their families, our seniors and disabled if the federal government is unilaterally determined to recognize an Indian tribe in northern New Jersey near New York Qty. Please note I used the word would; not what could happen.
First of all, an Indian casino operation in northern New Jersey would be the economic death knell to Atlantic City. Much of our market, which we and the state, our economic partner, have worked hard to create and protect, would disappear. No one will ride two hours in traffic to do the same thing that they could do in fifteen minutes or a half hour. We would lose jobs -- a lot of them because casinos would be forced to close in a dwindling market.
New Jersey's public investment in a new convention center, in airport development would be seriously compromised. Millions spent on new infrastructure and highway development would have been wasted. Atlantic City, even today, is a state resource and treasure which would be immediately undermined.
Let's forget Donald Trump and the casino industry for a moment. What about New Jersey citizens. Certainly the millions for seniors and the disabled and reinvestment would decrease quite measurably. The money will not be replaced by an Indian casino.
What about the state? Would New Jersey be able to assure itself that its public policy of strict regulation would be maintained? Not to the extent that it now controls the regulation of gaming in Atlantic City. Under existing laws, no state has prerogative over Indian gaming. Therefore, the state would be powerless to carry out regulatory policy over these operations. It is quite a dichotomy. New Jersey, which has prided itself as the state with the strictest form of casino regulation, could be forced to accept lesser standards for Indian tribes operating within its state. Such is the nature of State-Indian compact negotiations where states are forced to accept less than optimum regulatory measures out of fear that they will be sued by Indian tribes for not negotiating in ""good faith.""""""
And what about workers. Did you know, for example, this week at the AFL/CIO meeting in San Francisco that some of our largest unions, the Service Workers, the Seafarers, the Operating Engineers and the Restaurant and Hotel Workers joined to form the Riverboat and Indian Gaming Service Trade Council? The purpose of the council is clear-cut: to protect workers. Do you know why? Because federal laws, like the Taft-Hartley, like the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board do not apply. They also cease to exist at the tribal land doorstep. At present, union workers even in states like New Jersey, would have no federally or state protected rights or the ability to organize in casinos operated on tribal lands. The unions hope to do something about this. They hope to gain the right to recognition, the right to organize if they so choose. Quite frankly, I hope they have better luck than we have had so far.
So gentlemen, the issue is really not Donald Trump and the moneyed casino interests against various Indian tribes. The issue is whether our government in recognizing the legitimate rights of our native Americans will simultaneously assure that the rights of our state's own citizens, our workers, our seniors and, yes, even Donald Trump, are not bargained away or stomped upon in the process.
That is the reason that myself and others are supporting Bob Torricelli's legislation and also why I filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of the Interior. I'm a citizen, and I believe it is my right to protect myself and my companies when the government refuses to do so.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Well what I have is, I have many, many instances of events one after another -- organized crime figures, killings, deaths, laundering of money. I mean I could read them to you. Frankly, this would have been much more interesting to read than my own testimony. That is why I decided not to read my testimony. Wisconsin, White Earth tribe, all the Apache Tribe -- all instances one afl:er another. I have more instances here. You folks know that. I really believe you know that, and I could give you any documentation I have.
Now, this is without having people watching. This is with listening to an FBI person saying that he has got no men -- no men, zero -- assigned to the reservation.
At the Taj Mahal, I spent more money on my security and my security systems than most Indians spend in building their entire casino, and I will tell you, without that kind of security equipment and that surveillance equipment and the numbers of people, you cannot police it.
But what you really also need is, you need government help. When the bad guys come in, when the tough guys come in, you have got to have somebody behind you. There is nobody behind these people. There is nobody there. There is nobody there to help, and when the tough guys go up and they say what they want, I truly don't believe -- I truly do not believe, and I don't believe you believe, that anybody is going to do anything about it. They are going to get everything they want.
I think it is far beyond that. I think that people have got paper bags over their faces and nobody's looking. Everybody, it seems to me, from even just a common sense standpoint, knows what is going on. Everybody knows what is going on.
I can tell you this. In New Jersey you have what is called a black list, or a list of people that we are not allowed to do business with. These people were a constant source of irritation. I can supply the list of names if you would like the list of names. But it was a large list of names, and these were not very good people, and some of them were plenty rough. These people were a constant irritation, a constant problem. We weren't supposed to, but they were always trying to get in, trying to be down there, trying to do whatever they do, and it was a constant source.
One of my executives told me the other day, ""The only good thing about the Indian reservation is that we don't see these people any more
Yes, sir.
This was a list that was given to me by lawyers of various things that are currently going on and investigations and, by the way, convictions, many convictions on the list.
I am not a law enforcement officer. I am not supposed to be going around checking Indian reservations. That is what you have the FBI for, and they are very capable, the most capable. But that is not my job. My job is to come here and tell you that from a standard of the largest casino operator in the world, which I am, I will tell you that there is no way the Indian gaming is going to be controlled and not be totally taken advantage and, in my opinion, totally taken over in almost every instance, totally taken over, by the mob. There is no way that the Indians are going to protect themselves from the mob. There is no way.
I think most of you people sitting up there honestly believe that. I don't know that that is going to affect your judgment, but I believe that you honestly believe that.
From a common sense standpoint, from a practical standpoint, there is no way the Indians are going to protect themselves from the mob.
You can't have evidence when the FBI doesn't have one man assigned to Indian gaming. How can you have evidence? That is exactly the point. You need armies of people, armies of people to check. Every check that they have written, you have got to check those checks. You have got to see who is supplying the meat, who is supplying the potatoes, who is supplying the potato chips. You have got to check every supplier going into that Indian reservation.
The checking is a joke. The checking is a joke, and you have got to do something because this will be the biggest crime problem in this country's history, in my opinion.
It would be an honor. Thank you.
Well, I think that it is a very sad thing for the States. I can tell you that I believe it is 49 out of 50 governors are totally against what has taken place.
I know that for a fact Governor Cuomo was forced to sign a pact that he totally didn't want to sign. The communities are up in arms in upstate New York, totally up in arms, and it has just gotten out of control.
You see, I have a very big psychological problem here. I really don't know if it is possible to protect all of the people from all of these reservations. You have too many sources in terms of organized crime, you have just too many places, and so we can say, well, we will put 500 FBI agents on each reservation. But from a practical standpoint you can't do that.
So with all of these reservations opening up, and literally opening up on a daily basis, it seems to me, I don't know if it is physically possible, physically possible, for law enforcement to any longer protect.
Before, you had Las Vegas and you had Atlantic City, and I used to hear stories that there were more agents assigned to Las Vegas and Atlantic City than to any other major city in the United States. Now I don't know if that is correct or not, but I believe it was very correct. In fact, it was even a substantial amount more.
I don't believe that you have enough people when you start getting into this many reservations. The money is too much, and it is there, and it is too easy. It is too easy to skim if you don't have the right law enforcement. It is too easy to skim if you don't have the right procedures. It is too easy to launder money if you don't have the right procedures and the right law enforcement.
So I think you folks have a real problem. I'll be honest. I think you have a real problem. You created a monster. When you were in Las Vegas and when you were in Atlantic City, you had two places, and you can have 500 agents in each place, and you can do your number. But when you start having 100 and 150 locations all over the place, I think you have created yourself a real mess.
I am opposed to gambling when it can't be policed, and I don't believe the Indian reservations can be policed, there's too many of them, and especially when people claim sovereignty when, in fact, there is nothing sovereign. It is only sovereign in that they don't pay taxes.
Well, I am very concerned about the Indians' image in terms of gaming because when it blows -- and, as I said before, it will blow -- that is going to taint the entire industry, including Atlantic City and including Las Vegas.
When it is learned about the laundering and all of the skimming and all of the cheating and everything else that can go on unabated at the Indian reservations, people aren't going to say that is just Indian reservations, they are going to say that is Atlantic City, that is Las Vegas, despite the fact that Trump has hundreds and hundreds of people in each casino policing and making sure everything is legit, they are not going to say that. They are going to say that gaming is a dirty business, look what happened at this particular casino.
So when it blows, it is going to be a huge story. There is no doubt about the fact it is going to blow. It is just a question of time. But that is going to taint the whole industry, including the legitimate industry.
Thank you, sir.
That is absolutely correct, sir.
I can get other representatives of the Internal Revenue, I believe, to say the exact opposite. I can get representatives of the FBI, I believe, to say the exact opposite.
I do not believe that you can correct this situation. I do not believe
I do not believe that by just
No. It has something to do with organized crime.
No. I don't believe that organized crime can stay with us for a very long period; they will be caught. I do not believe they can be caught on an Indian reservation. I am not saying that we can't have individual transactions go wrong, but they will be caught. We have every check and balance. I am talking beyond law enforcement. We have every check and balance.
But do you know what is nice about us? We can say, ""Hey
If you look at their security systems, if you look at what they have installed in their casinos
If you look -- I am not saying anything
I am answering your question very nicely, sir.
I mean I don't think you want to hear the real answer. That is the problem. If you look
My contention is that there are too many places, and if they are going to go under the cry of sovereignty where they don't have the same powers -- where this Government doesn't have the same police powers over them, I say that there is absolutely no way that you are going to keep the mob out of the Indian reservations, and therefore
And therefore that cannot be met.
I didn't indicate they don't pay taxes. I said they are not paying taxes on casinos, and they are not paying taxes on
Oh really? What about the $400 million profit
What about the $400 million profit that they get, the 300 Indians?
Respectfully, sir, I really don't believe you understand, and if you do, then we have a bigger problem.
What we have is, when the tough guys, the bad guys, walk on to that reservation, I really don't believe that an Indian leader will be able to tell that gentleman to get the hell off.
Like I can. You know why? Because I have a lot of backup. I have the United States Government, I have FBI, I have U.S. attorneys, I have all of these people as my backup. They don't have the backup. They want to be sovereign.
Yes, I have read the gaming law.
Have they ever done it?
Sir, I think you are kidding yourself, respectfully, and I would just like to add, you have in Connecticut a tribe that is going to make, I think, $500 million profit -- profit -- this year. I believe that tribe has 300 members, maybe it has 400, but it has a very small number of members.
I would like to know, when you say they go back and they give the money to themselves and they reinvest, do you think it is appropriate that the 300 people who happen to have lucked out in a sense by having a reservation between Manhattan and Boston -- do you think it is appropriate that that money be spent on those 300 people, or do you think maybe, now maybe, that money should be spread for all Indians all over the Nation, many of which don't have the luck of being next to Boston or New York City?
And put a lot of people to work, sir.
I never said that, sir, and I think you know I never said that.
They didn't in these cases, sir.
Well, they are cases, they are convictions. You can go and get the case number.
We have got many cases. Sir, we have got many cases in here. I don't think you have seen them.
I certainly never said that, and I certainly don't appreciate the fact that you are putting words in my mouth because it is incorrect, and I have great respect for the Indians, and if I were -- and if I were running a reservation and was under the auspices of this ridiculous Act that was passed, I would have the same difficulty as the Indians keeping organized crime out, I, me. So that is not a blanket
Excuse me, sir. That is not a blanket indictment of anybody.
Well, you can't know when you have no FBI agents assigned to the Indian reservations, sir.
Oh really? How many FBI agents are in Las Vegas right now? How many FBI agents are assigned to Atlantic City? Why didn't you ask that question?
They are there to stop crime. So why aren't they there with respect to the Indian reservations?
Look, you have got a totally closed mind on the subject, sir.
We could walk in here with the greatest proof in the history of the world, and frankly, your mind is so closed, for whatever reason, that I can't believe it.
If you really want to study this, when you tell me that there are no FBI agents assigned to the Indian reservations and yet you have tremendous numbers in Las Vegas and Atlantic City -- tremendous numbers, in fact, two of their largest places -- I want to tell you something, you have a long way to go, and, for whatever reason, you have a closed mind, I don't know why. Perhaps you could tell me.
You are going to be very embarrassed in two years, sir.
I didn't say that, sir. Quote it, I didn't say that. Who said that? Who said that? I would like an apology right now, because I didn't say that,
Mr, Miller, Imus opened the broadcast -- excuse me, Mr, Imus said that,
Mr, Trump, Okay, Could I please have an apology?
Thank you, sir.
That probably is me, absolutely, because I'll tell you what, if you look -- if you look at some of the reservations that you have approved -- you, sir, in your great wisdom, have approved -- I will tell you right now, they don't look like Indians to me, and they don't look like Indians. Now maybe we say politically correct or not politically correct. They don't look like Indians to me, and they don't look like Indians to Indians, and a lot of people are laughing at it, and you are telling how tough it is, how rough it is, to get approved. Well, you go up to Connecticut, and you look. Now, they don't look like Indians to me, sir.
Yes. It depends whether or not you are approving it, sir.
Oh really?
I want to find out -- well, then, why are you approving -- you are approving for Indian. Why don't you approve it for everybody then, sir? If your case is nondiscriminatory, why don't you approve for everybody? You are saying only Indians -- wait a minute, sir. You are saying only Indians can have the reservations, only Indians can have the gaming. So why aren't you approving it for everybody? Why are you being discriminatory? Why is it that the Indians don't pay tax but everybody else does? I do. Why is it that I pay tax? Why is it that senior citizens get tremendous benefits from the taxes that a certain industry does but the Indians aren't contributing to that? Why aren't the Indians -- excuse me, sir. Why aren't the Indians that are making all the money in Connecticut, which is the most successful of the Indian reservations -- why aren't they spreading the wealth with the other Indians, sir? Why don't you do something for the other Indians that are living in total poverty? Because -- you know why? Because their reservation is too far away
I am sure he will, absolutely.
I think I know the answer from him.
Why don't they spread the wealth? That is the question.
Why don't they spread the wealth?
Hardly negotiated, sir. It was really forced down people's throats, wouldn't you say?
Do you think Governor Weicker -- do you think Governor Weicker -- do you think Governor Weicker considers that a negotiated agreement, sir?
Wasn't that forced down his throat?
No. I said -- I didn't ask that question.
Mr, Miller, Okay, You ask the question again.
Mr, Trump. Do you want me to ask another question?
I said to you, you have a group of Indians, I think, that has a reservation in Connecticut that is making, I believe, perhaps in excess of $500 million. There are a total of 400 people or 300 people, or a very small amount of people in that particular tribe. To make $500 million for 300 people, I ask you -- and this is a Federal pact, this is done with the auspices of your office and allowed through the auspices of your office -- why isn't that wealth, if you are so concerned, sir, about the Indians, which I think you should be, and I think it is a great concern -- if you are so concerned with the impact and the welfare of the Indians, why do you allow 300 people to make $500 million? Why don't you say that that money has to be distributed around so that other people can be helped, so that medical care in other locations in the United States, where you have Indians that are truly living in poverty, so that they can be taken care of? How can you allow this to happen?
And what we are really doing, and getting off the subject -- you know and I know that this is going to blow.
Mr, Miller. No, Mr. Trump, I don't know that.
Oh, you don't know it?
I have not.
I have not, sir. That will be your second apology, I hope. I have not tried.
Mr, Miller. Well, I have a letter here from Mr. Bunce who talks about your various contacts regarding the possibility of your involvement in a venture, the Agua Caliente, and I will Mr. Trump. Mr. Who?
Legal counsel of who?
Oh, you mean somebody wrote to me asking for -- that is not my people writing, sir.
At my request?
Sir, that is somebody writing a letter to me, I am not writing a letter to them. I don't blame them for wanting
That is true. I think that is true, yes.
No, the conclusion is, hey, this thing is running rampant, they are running public companies for the most part, they might as well get on the ship. But they know, and if they were down here testifying, they know that when you have this many entities, this many -- they know, they are professionals -- that you cannot control the mob, you cannot control the organized crime, you are not going to do it.
Willy Sutton
Willy Sutton -- excuse me, sir -- Willy Sutton said he robbed banks, he said that is where the money is. Well, the mob is going into the casinos, and what they are doing is, they are going into the Indian casinos because, sir, that is where the money is, but also that is where the lack of enforcement is.
Sir, that is where the lack of enforcement is.
Because they want to make money.
Because they want to make money, sir, because they really want to make money, and I have -- you know, I have a great love for this country. I happen to be
I didn't say the companies are honest. I said the regulatory process is honest. The regulatory process is a huge and cumbersome thing that, in the end
Do you want me to answer the question?
The regulatory
The regulatory process-
The regulatory process, in a limited number of locations, can keep casino gaming honest. When you open up hundreds of locations randomly without even State control -- I am not saying State or anything, but without any control -- there is no way to keep that honest, whether I run it, whether Caesar's runs, whether the Indians are running it. There is no way. You have too many places, you have too much money involved. The mob is going to take over it. It is starting to come out. It will start coming out a lot more, and in two years, sir, you are going to be a very embarrassed man.
Thank you, sir.
They have had no choice, sir.
Sir, I will just give you a quick answer, and then the Congressman will give you a much more appropriate answer to something else. I will tell you that, you asked me about governors, and you said the governors are routinely signed. The governors are being forced
Sir, they are not hard bargaining, because if Mario Cuomo didn't sign his pact in Syracuse, the Indians were going to court, and they would have won on summary judgment based on the ridiculous law that was passed, okay? So it is not hard bargaining. He sat there and he had absolutely no choice.
Lowell Weicker, who I have great respect for, fought and fought and fought and ultimately was bludgeoned into having to accept this, and he is not happy about it, and Connecticut is not happy about it, and Connecticut is a total disaster over Indian gaming. Mr. Abercrombie. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump. They have created a monster. Mr. Abercrombie. Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Mr. Torricelli, in as much as you are also a part of the panel, we will conclude this panel with your remarks. Mr. Torricelli. Thank you.
Hesitant though I am to engage in this conversation
Thank you, sir.

Fergus Ewing,United Kingdom,2020-06-10,"Presiding Officer, the current situation with Covid-19 is one of the biggest challenges we have faced in our lifetimes.
Preservation of life has been our overriding objective since the start of this crisis. It’s that simple.
By staying at home and following the physical distancing guidance the people of Scotland are doing everything they can to protect our NHS, our social care services, and to save lives.
However, the measures we have taken, and are continuing to take, to deal with this crisis reflect its magnitude. We have had to implement restrictions on liberties which have had a very serious impact on our economy, and our tourism and hospitality sector has been devastated.
I understand how difficult this is. Businesses have gone from anticipating another bumper tourism season this summer to seeing their income drop to zero almost overnight.
Presiding Officer, the Scottish and UK Governments have moved quickly to try to address the financial challenges faced by businesses affected by the current crisis, including those in the tourism and hospitality sector.
The Scottish Government has provided a package of support worth over £2.3 billion – going above and beyond the UK Government consequentials. We have provided rates relief, developed grant schemes not available elsewhere in the UK and we have met with and listened to businesses to understand where gaps still exist.
Since the middle of March, I myself have spent much of my time taking part in calls with sectoral organisations and business owners to hear first-hand the impact restrictions are having.
Many taking part in these calls have suffered the most severe impacts upon their lives and their livelihoods.
I would like to commend the work of organisations like the Scottish Tourism Alliance and UK Hospitality in representing their sectors and providing a vital bridge between the Scottish Government and businesses.
We have worked in partnership to ensure that the UK Government understands the pressures on the industry in Scotland.
That work is not completed. Kate Forbes and I have written to the Chancellor to request a discussion on how we can work together to further support the sector and alleviate some of the pressures on businesses, including through a review of VAT rates.
The UK Government must lead on a financial recovery plan for tourism in the UK with significant funding attached, and we will use those consequentials for the industry in Scotland.
From my numerous discussions with industry over the past weeks and months I know that what the industry needs now is clarity on when it will be able to re-open and start on the long road back to sustainability and growth.
I fully understand the unique challenges the uncertainty is creating. Businesses need to know what orders to place and when. They need to have more confidence to take bookings whilst understanding the risks inherent in the continued presence of the virus.
To take bookings they need to be able to plan staff rotas and shifts, and to restock, and they need to be in a position of readiness to go once restrictions are lifted and avoid any unnecessary delays. Some businesses may also wish to pre purchase PPE equipment.
Visitors also need time to request annual leave and to make bookings.
Notice, preparedness and readiness go hand in hand and are a key part of preparing for recovery.
The Scottish Government understands the exceptional and very challenging circumstances facing our Tourism and Hospitality sector. It is heavily dependent on seasonality, meaning the already limited opportunities are narrowing by the day. Many businesses are facing key decisions on their future, with all the implications for jobs and investment. It is an unenviable position by any measure.
I do not seek to underplay the impact this crisis is having on all parts of Scotland’s economy – it is, Presiding Officer, profound – but these facts do set this sector apart and this needs to be recognised. We have heard the messages clearly and we are not impervious to the sectors’ calls for more clarity.
Our responsibility is to balance the exceptional circumstances of the industry with the need to continue to take the right steps at the right time to protect life. Let us remember COVID-19 has not gone away and it remains a threat.
However I am keen to give additional clarity where possible and to provide an indicative date from which we hope the sector can begin to operate.
This cannot be definitive.
The science and health advice must be in the right place – the virus must have been suppressed, the Test and Protect system must be used effectively, and our Route-map must be on course.
Given the vital interdependencies between the tourism and hospitality sector and the wider sectors of the economy, including public transport, we must make holistic decisions about when to change restrictions. We cannot make changes for any sector, Presiding Officer, in isolation. This is why we must be assured that the epidemic is suppressed to enable the more general opening up of our country that will come with the re-opening of tourism and hospitality – so that everyone – employees, tourists, customers – can be confident that it is safe to make this change.
Statutory reviews of the current restrictions are required on 18 June and 9 July. Those reviews must take place and the outcomes of them must show the necessary progress in our fight against the virus for tourism to resume.
As things stand just now, our hope is that we will be able to give the go ahead to a re-opening of the sector at the 9 July review.
Assuming this does prove possible, some time would then be required for interconnected services such as transport to prepare.
On that basis and on the clear understanding with the industry that nothing can be absolutely guaranteed at this stage and that we may need to change this date if the evidence requires it, we would encourage tourism and hospitality businesses to prepare – within appropriate safety guidelines – for re-opening on 15 July.
For the reasons I have set out, this timetable is by necessity both provisional and conditional – but we very much hope it can be met and that setting it out now, even with caveats, gives the sector greater clarity and some much needed ability to plan ahead.
And I cannot stress enough how important it is for the time until then to be used to implement the changes that are necessary to satisfy regulations and adapt to a new way of living.
On that – I will say something about this new way of life – because things will not be the same as before. Covid-19 has changed that, and safety must come first.
I can therefore also announce that we will soon be publishing guidance for the tourism and hospitality sector that will help businesses make the necessary changes.
We have worked closely with the industry in this area and this will provide a key link between government and the good work done across the sector to prepare guidelines and practical measures for safe re-opening.
It will mean things will look and feel different and I understand that this is also a challenge for businesses. Workplaces will need to adapt and innovate to make best use of space and facilities within the guidelines.
There will be a key role for the industry in building confidence in communities who may understandably be hesitant to welcome back visitors.
Customers – us, the public – will also need to adapt to new ways of using these services, just as we have had to do throughout the crisis – but I do have confidence everyone will – once again – rise to that challenge.
I accept it is disruptive and difficult. The measures are however essential to ensure workplaces are safe and compliant – and in keeping with our Fair Work principles they have been developed in partnership with trade unions and the appropriate regulatory bodies.
It will give confidence to employers, employees, customers and the public that Scotland’s tourism and hospitality sector is prepared and ready to once again provide safe, reliable and enjoyable experiences.
Presiding Officer if I may make one final announcement before I finish – I want to highlight today that I am setting up a Scottish Tourism Recovery Taskforce to take forward strategic oversight of, and provision of advice on, recovery plans in response to the Covid-19 impact on Scottish tourism and hospitality.
This taskforce will be responsible for ensuring that the tourism recovery plan is fully coordinated with wider Scottish Government and other recovery plans.
It will also take into account wider actions being taken by the UK Government, other devolved administrations and international best practice, including that of the European Union.
I will Chair this taskforce along with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, Jamie Hepburn.
I will announce the membership shortly – we are in the process of seeking to finalise this – and will publish a draft work plan for the group, which will include:
It will work with closely with the sector, allowing us to identify the key actions necessary for a strong and safe recovery.
Presiding Officer, 3 months ago, at the start of March, I was involved in the launch of Scotland’s new tourism strategy, taking us through to 2030. That strategy sought to make Scotland the world leader in 21st century tourism.
That should still be our ambition. Scotland has a wealth of assets and a wonderful reputation as a welcoming country. The COVID-19 crisis has been devastating for the industry, but we must look to rebuild the sector and to begin welcoming visitors once again.
We recognise that in order to achieve that businesses must be ready to go when safe to do so and avoid any unnecessary delay, inflicting yet more reputational and financial harm. Today’s further clarity on when that may happen will help avoid that and assist them to be ready to reopen.
Under the guidance of the new tourism taskforce, and with the incredible dedication and hard work of the thousands who work in tourism and hospitality, both in the public and private sectors, I believe we can make a strong and safe recovery.
Thank you.
",2020 Statement on Covid-19 and Scottish Tourism,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/fergus-ewing-2020-statement-on-covid-19-and-scottish-tourism/
Barack Obama,United States of America,2007-03-13,"Mr. President, I rise, first, to offer strong words of support for the statement that was just offered by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I, as well, rise today to speak in support of the Iraq resolution that the Senate will consider tomorrow.
Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad. Last week, a suicide bomber stood outside a bookstore and killed 20 people. Other attackskilled 118 Shia pilgrims. On Sunday, a car bomb went off in central Baghdad, and more than 30 people died. And the road from the airport into Baghdad is littered with smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and the memories of our sons and daughters.
Mr. President, the civil war in Iraq rages on. The insurgents have started to change their tactics. They hide in buildings and along the streets and wait for our helicopters. They've shot down at least eight U.S. helicopters in the last month. More of our soldiers are dying and coming home with their bodies broken and their nerves shattered at a VA system completely unprepared for what they need to rebuild their lives.
Mr. President, it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve. The American people have been extraordinarily resolved. They've seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah. They've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort -- money that they know could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a Nation. The failure has not been a failure of resolve. That's not what's led us into chaos. It's been a failure of strategy; and it's time that the strategy change. There is no military solution, Mr. President, to the civil war that rages on in Iraq; and it's time for us to redeploy so that a political solution becomes possible.
The news from Iraq is very bad, and it's been that way for at least four years. We all wish the -- that the land the President and the Vice President speak of exists. We wish that there was an Iraq where the insurgency was in the last throes, where the people work with security, where children play outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime sky. We wish for those things, but there's no alternative reality to what we see and read about in the news, to what we've experienced these long four years.
I repeat, Mr. President, there is no military solution to this war. At this point, no amount of soldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of someone else's civil war. The Iraqi people -- Shia, Sunni, and Kurd -- must come to the table and reach a political settlement themselves. If they want peace, they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it.
Our failed strategy in Iraq has strengthened Iran's strategic position, reduced U.S. credibility and influence around the world,  placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in the region in greater peril. These are not the signs of a well-laid plan. It's time for a profound change.
This is what we're trying to do here today. We're saying it is time to start making plans to redeploy our troops so that they can focus on the wider struggle against terrorism, win the war in Afghanistan, strengthen our position in the Middle East, and pressure the Iraqis to reach a political settlement. Even if this effort falls short, we will continue to try to accomplish what the American people asked for last November.
I'm glad to see, though, that this new effort is gaining consensus. And I want to commend Senator Reid for his efforts. He took the time to listen -- so many of us from both Chambers of Congress could help develop this plan.
The decision in particular to begin a phased redeployment, with the goal of redeploying all our combat forces by March 31st, 2008, is the right step. It's a measure the Iraq Study Group spoke of, an idea I borrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill I introduced, now has more than 60 cosponsors from House and Senate and from both sides of the aisle. They've supported this plan since I announced a similar plan in January.
The decision allows some U.S. forces to remain in Iraq with a clear mission to protect U.S. and coalition personnel, conduct counterterrorism operations, and to train and equip Iraqi forces; and that is a smart decision. President al-Maliki spoke at a conference and warned that the violence in Iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes unchecked. By maintaining a strong presence in Iraq and the Middle East, as both my bill and the leadership bill does, we can ensure that the chaos does not spread.
I should also add that the decision to begin this phased redeployment within 120 days is a practical one. Our military options have been exhausted. It's time to seek a political solution to this war, and with this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that they need to arrive at an accommodation.
Mr. President, while I strongly believe that this war never should have been authorized, I believe we must be as careful in ending the war as we were careless getting in. While I prefer my approach, as reflected in my bill, I believe that this new resolution does begin to point U.S. policy in Iraq and the region in the right direction. An end to the war, and achieving a political solution to Iraq's civil war, will not happen unless we demand it.
Peace with stability doesn't just happen because we wish for it. It comes when we never give in and never give up and never tire of working towards a life on Earth worthy of our human dignity. The decisions that have been made have led us to this crossroads -- a moment of great peril, Mr. President.
We have a choice. We can continue down the road that's weakened our credibility and damaged our strategic interests in the region or we can turn toward the future. The road won't be smooth, and I have to say, Mr. President, that there will be risks with any approach. But this approach is our last best hope to end this war so we can begin to bring our troops home and begin the hard work of securing our country and our world from the threats that we face.
The President has said he will continue down the road towards more troops and more of the same failed policies. The President sought and won authorization from Congress to wage this war from the start. But he is now dismissing and ignoring the will of the American people, that is tired of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount.
Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad, but it can change if we in this Chamber say ""enough.""
Let this day be the day that begins the painful and difficult work of moving from this crossroad.
Let this be the day that we begin pulling towards the future with a responsible conclusion to this painful chapter in our Nation's history.
Mr. President, let this be the day when we finally send a message that is so clear and so emphatic that it cannot be ignored.
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.
",Senate Floor Speech in Favor of Iraq Federalism Amendment,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamasenatespeechiraqfederalismamendment.htm
Franklin D. Roosevelt,United States of America,1933-03-04 00:00:00,"President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends:
This is a day of national consecration. And I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.
In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.
More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.
Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.
True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.
The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.
Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men.
Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation asks for action, and action now.
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.
Hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly.
Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments, so that there will be an end to speculation with other people's money; and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.
These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress, in special session, detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States.
Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.
The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first considerations, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United States-a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure.
In the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor -- the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others -- the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.
If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife.
With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.
Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations.
It is to be hoped that the normal balance of Executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.
I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken Nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption.
But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis -- broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.
For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less.
We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life.
We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.
In this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.

Andrew Mitchell,United Kingdom,2016-01-02,"class=""first-para"">I rise to address the House for the first time in a spirit of great humility—deeply honoured to represent my constituency in this place.
I am particularly pleased to have caught your eye relatively early in the Session, Madam Deputy Speaker, so that I may pay tribute to my predecessor, Sir Philip Holland. Philip’s love and knowledge of this place and his service to his constituency was well known and well respected—as much in Gedling as in this House.
I mean no disrespect to Acton when I say that Philip graduated from that seat, from 1959 to 1964, to Carlton, which he went on to represent for 21 years—latterly as the constituency of Gedling, following the Boundary Commission’s most recent review.
Any hon. Member who chairs the Committee of Selection and yet remains so well liked and respected by hon. Members on both sides of the House must be endowed with the greatest of skills. Only time will tell whether any of my hon. Friends will take up Sir Philip’s mantle as a great hunter of quangos. I have been left in no doubt over the past few weeks that Philip’s many friends on both sides of the House will join me in wishing him and Lady Jo Holland a long and happy retirement.
The House may be aware that I am not the first member of my family to have taken his seat in this House; indeed, I am at least the fourth to have done so. Nevertheless, over the past three weeks I have come to the confident conclusion that not since Lloyd George have so many people known my father.
I beg to suggest that the constituency of Gedling is insufficiently well known outside Nottinghamshire. The rural deanery of Gedling, which gave its name to the refashioned seat of Carlton in 1983, is far more compact than its predecessor, having lost all the land south of the River Trent. My constituency stands at the crossroads of England, with a foot in the north, a foot in the south, but its heart in the Midlands.
Many hon. Members wax lyrical about the rural or urban nature of their constituencies and their agricultural or commercial interests. The great delight and at traction of the Gedling constituency lies in the exciting cross-section of the great variety of our national life that it provides. From the rural beauty and farming lands at the northern end to the more industrial areas of Netherfield and Colwick, my constituency includes the prime residential areas of Carlton, Woodthorpe and Arnold, perched either side of a hilly ridge. It also contains the attractive villages of Gedling, Burton Joyce and Stoke Bardolph, which include two of the most beautiful churches in the country which date from Saxon times. The Gedling colliery is achieving record productivity. It has been recruiting new members to the industry over the past six months and is an important feature of my constituency.
The quality of life enjoyed by my constituents is, by and large, excellent. We are particularly well served by the fine health facilities in Nottinghamshire which have seen a 30 per cent. decrease in waiting lists over the past four years. My constituents profit from living under the benign sway of the Gedling borough council, which is continuously singled out for praise by the Audit Commission for its standards of efficiency and service provision. Indeed, the council had its own version of the right to buy before the Government introduced their Housing Bill in 1980. We receive national and international delegations to inspect our housing schemes for the elderly and the frail elderly.
Of great significance is the fact that Gedling lies alongside the city of Nottingham. We know only too well that what happens in Nottingham today affects us in Gedling tomorrow. Gedling’s wealth and success are inextricably linked to the future of Nottingham city. As I try to follow that rocky pathway which is the lot of a Government Back Bencher, travelling as it does between toadyism and revolt, I shall be hoping, Madam Deputy Speaker, to catch your eye in the future when the Government’s bold plans to tackle the problems of our inner city come under discussion. We have much to be proud of in Gedling, and I am pleased to have been able to tell the House briefly some of those things.
I hope that I am being equally uncontroversial when I say that it is the supply side of our economy that must particularly command our attention and the Bill, with these two principal measures, makes a direct contribution on that front. In spite of significant progress on the supply side, there remain real restrictions on job mobility, occasioned by the lack of private rented accommodation and immobility within the council housing system.
The problems within education and training are well rehearsed, but the results are that we do not always turn out children equipped to compete in today’s industries or win tomorrow’s jobs. There are still problems within the labour market which hinder productivity along with our industrial performance. Above all, there is the absurdity of a system whose rigidities can attribute greater value to being unemployed than to working.
Tax relief for profit-related pay will ecourage the widespread adoption of such schemes and will help to dispel any vestige of that bizarre myth which was prevalent during the days of our economic decline in some parts of the private sector —that pay is somehow not in reality always directly linked to profitability.
These measures will help further to eradicate the them-and-us sentiments which for so long have dogged British industry. They will extend and enhance a community of interest between employee, employer and shareholder and secure a more motivated and committed work force. Above all, who can doubt that such measures, when implemented, will act to cut unemployment by ensuring less risk for an employer contemplating taking on labour as well as acting as an alternative to redundancy when times are bad?
I believe that the clauses which relate to private pensions will secure an equally warm welcome. They improve the lot of the early leaver, and perhaps I should declare an interest at this point. It is a sad fact that many who have changed careers during their working life are particularly disadvantaged in respect of their pension entitlements. The relevant clauses in the Bill will not only increase the freedom to choose in pension planning but free another rigidity in the labour market over the long term.
The Bill’s provisions join the many other economic measures taken by the Government to improve choice and freedom for millions of our fellow citizens. Such measures also extend personal responsibility greatly within society. It is the extent to which these opportunities and responsibilities have been grasped throughout society which is truly remarkable. Many of these measures have been practical methods to improve the commercial operation of our economy, but they are part of a shift in opinions and ideas, and expression of a new consensus which has sprung up. They mark a sea change in public opinion. It may be that the Falklands factor disguised the extent of support for this new reality, but the 1987 third election victory is a message which cannot be ignored on the Opposition Benches. Indeed, the right hon. I dare to suggest that even the hon.
It was a Conservative Prime Minister returning to office in 1951 who reflected in the House that the nation required time to allow certain Socialist legislation to reach its full fruition. Although the positions are not comparable, I hope that the Opposition will accept how great has been the revolution in the spread of choice and ownership within society as well as in personal responsibilities keenly grasped. It is time for the Opposition to embrace these verities.

Huw Merriman,United Kingdom,2020-05-18,"It is a pleasure to speak in this debate and to see you looking resplendent in the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I wish to take the opportunity to thank all my constituents, who have done the most amazing job rallying around and looking after each other—that is what makes my part of the East Sussex coast so special. I also wish to recognise and thank the Government for the support that they have given and the lead they have taken in these difficult times.
As MPs from all parties will be aware, we face day-to-day challenges. For the past few weeks, my daily challenge has been to try to get our Bexhill testing centre plugged into the central link. We have a frustrating situation whereby we have a testing centre, but it is not plugged in. If anyone from Deloitte is following proceedings, I ask them to plug our local centre in to the national link so that local people can use their local testing centre.
In my few remaining minutes I wish to focus on the Transport Committee’s inquiry on coronavirus and the implications for the transport sector. We have been looking at the aviation sector, which is clearly on its knees right now and needs our assistance. I note the Government support and welcome it, but recent days have seen us looking towards quarantine. My question to the Government is why now? If it is required from a health perspective, why was it not introduced at the start of lockdown? If it is required now, what help will there be for the aviation sector so that it can pick up? It is important not just for jobs and travel, but for our imports and exports. Some 40% of all imports arrive in the belly of airliners arriving at Heathrow, and it is important that we support them.
The aviation sector itself needs to do more to support its staff. Yesterday, the chief executive of British Airways’ parent group, Willie Walsh, appeared before the Select Committee. Almost a third of BA staff are facing redundancy, and those who remain have been told that their terms and conditions will be lowered and altered. Some of those terms and conditions have nothing to do with costs—for example, they may relate to grievance procedures. It feels as if BA is using this as an opportunity to undertake long-held reforms of terms and conditions. I asked the chief executive whether he would be willing to allow those employees to share the proceeds of growth if things return back to normal times, but he refused to give that assurance. Thousands of BA staff have contacted me and other members of the Select Committee. They are clearly the best of employees—they care about their carrier and they care about each other— and I hope that BA will use the welcome extension of furlough to put the redundancy plans back in the hold, where they deserve to be.
I also want to talk briefly about Gatwick, my local airport. It is—or has been—the busiest single runway airport, handling 46 million passengers each year. It is an important national asset, and I really hope that it will survive.
The next Committee session for us will be on buses and trains. We are very concerned about the worker situation. There are 9.9 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 UK males, yet in the bus sector the figure is 26.4 deaths. Clearly, more needs to be done to protect those workers. I support the measures that the Government have brought in today regarding passengers using their own PPE, ​although I note that, in France, PPE is being handed out on a more professional basis by workers. In Germany, the transport system is back operating as normal because it recognises that social-distancing just does not work in practice. As we move out of lockdown, I hope that we can be more flexible so that we protect our economy and our transport sector.
",2020 Speech on Covid-19,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/huw-merriman-2020-speech-on-covid-19/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2015-11-18,"And you know, sadly there are about 3,000 people outside. They're coming in now. How about waiting about an hour till they get in? Good idea? No. So we'll just say, they were late. It's their problem. Here's my great friend. My great veteran friend. Are you OK? Everything good? Good. Good. And we're gonna take care of our veterans, I want to tell you that.
Big league. Right? Big League. Big league. So a few things. We just came down and I just heard Massachusetts -- you know, they keep saying -- the press. Look at all those guys back there, with all those life cameras all the time. Boo. Boo. But -- well, actually, about 30% of them are good though. I think 30%, maybe 25%, 25%. Maybe 20%. But you know the Massachusetts poll, listen to this one, 48% for Trump; 9% for somebody else.
You know, when I used to do this. They'd come out then say, I started. And my wife said, you know, if you run, you're gonna win. I said, why do you say that? Because people want to see good things happen. And you know -- so you know -- hey, that's a good thing. That's a smart thing for a wife to say, right?
I don't know if she meant it or not. But it's very smart. But she said, you're gonna win. So anyway, I started off and I started at three and it went to six and it went to nine and it went to 16. And every time it went up, these talking heads on the different shows. They say, well, you know, he's plateaued.
He's plateaued. Well, you know, at 48%, I hope I plateaued. I want that. I want to plateau. It's been an amazing period. And I'll tell you what, this has been a movement. This isn't like a normal -- and look at the people pouring in. This has been, this has been a movement. No matter where I go and I don't even know if it's for me. It's for me, I guess, a little bit.
It's for the message. We want to win again. We want to win. We want to win. So just two minutes ago, Fox -- we like Fox, right? They came out with their poll and it's brand new, so I'll give it to you. Trump, 27; Rubio, second place, 13; Carson, 9. He's going down. He's going down. He's got to know about foreign policy.
You got to know. You got to know. Gotta study. You gotta be able to get that stuff, right? But -- and you know when you think of Rubio, in all fairness, a nice guy, stood next to me the other day at the debate. Nice, very nice, made a lot of mistakes, a lot of mistakes. And he's got the worst voting record in the United States Senate.
I'll take what, if I were from Florida, I'd be very angry. So today, he's in California, fundraising and they have voting and it's sort of interesting because it's a vote on -- and it's really more than -- almost more important. They're getting ready for homeland security issues and votes. And he's in California.
What's he doing? He's raising money. Always money with these politicians. Money, money, money. I'm still funding my own campaign. I don't have to raise. I don't have to raise money. I'm gonna raise any money. You know. It's very interesting, very, very interesting. I said to somebody the other day. I was in Iowa.
I said, what do you think he's gonna respond? So I had this great group of people and I said, you know, I feel it's just not my thing. I want to go and I want it -- can I take -- millions and millions of dollars is being offered to me all the time. I could make Jeb Bush's fund look like peanuts. I mean, think of it. Guys are offering me anything.
You know, these super PACs are a big scam. You know that. It's a big scam. And the super PACs they control all the candidates. And the people that give the super PACs money totally control the candidates. And I just about disavowed all super PACs. You know, we sent out letters. I had like 9 or 11. All these -- everybody was setting up a Trump super PAC and probably 25% were legit.
And the other 75% wanted to take the money and who the hell knows what they do with it. They live very nicely. But we disavowed. We disavowed. We don't want super PACs. We don't want it. We don't want it. And I said to the folks and it was to me very important. But I said to the folks in Iowa, OK, let's have a deal.
We can do the following and it's so important to me. I'll take millions and millions of dollars. It will come in like by the droves. And I promise, it won't affect me. Can I do it? And they went nuts. No. Because they're smart. They said, you can't do it. Because we all know that when somebody like me, I used to give fortunes.
I was like the fair haired boy. I give -- all these lobbyists that are giving the money, I know many of them. When they give $5 million, $2 million, $1 million, $10 million. Believe me, they have total control over their little politician. Total control. And they don't care about the country. Some of them represent other countries.
Some of them represent businesses from other countries that want to do business in the United States. They don't care about the country. They want to get their client the right vote. So you have special interests, you have lobbyists, you have donors, they have total control over these people that are running for office.
And nobody knows it better than me because I've been there. And you know, it's sort of funny, I've been there like nobody's been there like I have. And I was totally establishment. Can you believe it? They come to my office. $250,000 to the Republican Governors Association. $100,000 shortly thereafter again to the Republican Governors Association.
Millions of dollars you spend. And you know, when you call, they treat you so nicely. They treat you so nicely. So when you see negative stuff and I'll I'll match a bullet -- wait til you see what I do. You're gonna be so proud of me. It's gonna be so vicious. Gonna be so vicious. Because right now -- and in one way, I hate saying it. But in another way, it's smart.
So far, I've spent less money than anybody else and I have the best result, right? Right? Now, in one way, people said, well, we'd like you to spend more money. The press says it all the time. When are you gonna start spending money? I haven't had to. You know, you leading in every single poll, national.
Now Iowa just came out. I'm leading in Iowa. Leading, leading really big in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is unbelievable, big. Leading in South Carolina, the first three. Leading in Nevada. Nevada came out today. Leading in Nevada. Leading with Hispanics in Nevada. I've been saying that. I've been saying that.
Leading with African-Americans at a point at which nobody has ever gotten. The number is 25%. Somebody said, if you got 25% of the African-American vote as a Republican, don't forget, I'm a Republican. If you've got 25%, the election's over. It's over. And then they came out with polls today, North Carolina, South Carolina, other places, against Hillary, we're killing Hillary in all these states.
Killing her. Crazy. So let's talk a little bit about our country. We're just gonna have fun and those poor people. By the time we're finished. They're gonna be in. They're gonna hear probably the final sentence, which will be make America great again. Right? That's what it will be. So I was so focused on trade because I'll do -- thank you.
I love you too, darling. Look at her, how beautiful. I love her. So nice. Thank you. Thank you. I was so focused on trade for the last number of months and doing great on trade. Because you know, we're being ripped off by every country that we do business with because we have the worst negotiators. All you have to do is look at the Iran deal that was just signed.
Look at this deal. But one of your own, got it done. Carrie. Carrie. He did not read The Art of the deal, I can tell you. So Carrie goes out makes one of the worst deals that I've ever seen of any kind. Forget about nations. One of the worst deals $150 billion going to to Iran. Right? How about the self-policing aspect, is that good?
They're gonna self police. The other form of policing is 24 days, which takes a long time before you even get there. So they have like an infinite number of days before they can -- before you can inspect. And what about our prisoners? We have four prisoners. $150 billion and we don't get prisoners back. And they didn't want to do it -- think of it. They didn't want to do it because they said we don't want to complicate the negotiation.
Can you believe this? And all you had to do is say at the beginning, which, by the way, this thing is taking forever. You say at the beginning, we want our prisoners back before we start. We want them back. You don't need them. We want them. It's gonna set a good tone, right? It's gonna set a good tone. You'll end up making a better deal.
Give us your prisoners back. You don't need them. You don't want them. Your people don't even know you have them. And we didn't ask. I guarantee you that if I were negotiating that deal, even as secretary of state. I guarantee within a very short time, you'd have them. Because of the fact that I would have left the room if they said no, which they probably would have.
I would have doubled up the sanctions. And within three days, they would have called. And said, we have your prisoners here. Would you like them? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. So I've been so involved with trade because you know, when you lose -- when you have a trade imbalance with China of almost $500 billion.
You think of that. And somebody the other day -- very smart people -- I met with some smart people. I'm not gonna say who because it would be embarrassing. I think to them. They should, but you don't believe in free trade. I said, we got an imbalance of $500 billion with China. We have an imbalance of $70 billion a year with Japan.
We have an imbalance of $45 billion a year with Mexico. We will build a wall. Believe me. Believe me. We will build a wall and it will be a great wall. You know, I've been talking about the wall for a long time. We're gonna build it. It's gonna be really, a real wall. It's gonna be a wall that's going to be way up there.
Wow. It's gonna be strong. It's gonna be powerful. It's gonna look good. It's good as the wall could look. And it's gonna be -- they are so misguided. They don't get it. They don't get it. They don't get it. So we're gonna build the wall. It's gonna be a great wall and it's gonna be paid for by Mexico. Believe me. 100%. 100%. We're not paying for it. Mexico is paying for it. Believe me. Now, a lot of times when I'm on the stage with these guys that I'm running against, some are nice guys.
Hey look, Perry was very vicious. He was always very nice to me. And everybody so far that's attacked me has gone down. They've gone down badly. You remember Perry attacked me? He was at five. He went to zero. He got out. Walker attacked me very viciously and he got out. I mean, it was phew. Think of what I could do for the United States.
Somebody attacks, oh they go down. Bobby Jindal, nice guy. He was vicious to me. I never even met him. I never met him. I was watching him last night. He said, I've decided to get out of the race. Oh, that was good. So one by one, step by step, we're getting there and we're gonna turn this thing around so fast.
So fast. We're gonna turn it around so fast you're gonna be so proud of the job I do. You're gonna be so proud of yourselves. You're gonna be so proud. We're gonna win so much. We're gonna win so much. We're gonna have a military that's gonna be so strong and so powerful that nobody is gonna mess with us. Nobody.
Nobody. Thank you. Isn't a Trump rally much more exciting than these other guys? And that kind of stuff only adds to the excitement. I tell you, it's just incredible. You know, what's happening though, no matter where I go, I mean, it's incredible. We went -- the other night -- no matter where we go -- Who?
What? You can't hear. Get over here. That's terrible. That's terrible. You have lousy seats up there. You have a lousy location. In real estate, you'd go bust. Good guy, though. No, he's fine. He's good. He's good. He just can't hear. He just can't hear. Are you OK? OK. I understand. So -- and they're still coming in over there.
So it's a little bit of a problem. So all over the country, this is what's happening. This is unique. You think? But we go to Mobile, Alabama, we have 35,000 people. We go to the Mavericks arena, right, in Dallas. You saw that. 20,000. We had three days, four days to fill it up. It filled up almost like in the first day.
No matter where we go. We went to Oklahoma, we had over 20,000 people. Every place in New Hampshire is packed. You know that. Where we have extra rooms set aside. It's absolutely it's so beautiful to see. And what it is, is it's love in the room. It's like love. Now we have a couple of people that don't have so much love.
That's OK. But it's love. I'll tell you truthfully. It's love in the room. So here's what we're doing. I've been talking very, very much and very strongly about trade. When I announced it took a lot of courage to announce. I mean, you know, this is -- I've always read where if you're a very successful person, you can't run for president.
You just can't. I've always heard that. Because you get treated very badly and very unfairly and I understand that. So we get people that aren't successful running for president. That's not good. Because that's not the mentality we need to get rid of our debt. It's not the mentality we need to make great trade deals.
It's not the mentality we need. So who the hell knows what's gonna happen. But I mean, whatever it is, I'm so proud of the fact that I've done it. Because it has -- you remember the famous escalator scene, where I come down. Melania waving very gently. I'm waving like a mad man. And the press was down there.
And I announce that I'm gonna run in New York City. At Trump Tower, I announce that I'm running for president. And then there, I talked about illegal immigration that it's a tremendous problem in this country. And did I get hit so hard by the press. And you wouldn't even be talking about immigration and illegal immigration, I believe, if I didn't bring it up. It wouldn't be a big subject.
It would not be a big subject. And it turned out to be the biggest subject. And then you have in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, get shot in the back by an illegal immigrant, who's crossed the border at least five times and probably many more times. You have Jamiel, a wonderful young man, going to college on a football scholarship already and he gets shot in the face by a guy that just walked up to him and shot him in the face in front of his home.
His father's a friend of mine. He couldn't -- he said, his life is over. His son, the apple of his eye, the most beautiful young guy, and he's dead, viciously killed for no reason. Illegal immigrant. You had a woman and actually, you had a veteran. 66-year-old woman raped, sodomized and killed four weeks ago in Los Angeles.
And you have hundreds and thousands, thousands of other incidents. Terrible. They're taking jobs. But more importantly, I want people to come into the country but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through the system. They have to come in through the system. And the Hispanic people -- because we're not only talking Hispanic.
But the Hispanic people are with me like 100%. The ones that are in the country legally. They don't want their jobs taken by people that are pouring in. And Obama, we just had -- It's true. We just had a great court victory. We had a victory at the lower court and it was just upheld two to one, where Obama's Executive Order that just come on in, take our country, do whatever you want, walk right by our great -- and they are really terrific people.
I know them. Spend a lot of time with him on the border. Our border patrols stand down. They're told stand down. They're standing there. They're tough. They're strong. They want to do their job. They're not allowed to do their job. Obama has been a disaster for this country, a disaster. And unless we get going and unless we get smart, we're not gonna have a country.
You need borders to have a country. Now what's happened -- you need borders. You need borders. So if I win, lots of things are gonna happen. Lots of things are gonna happen. Number one with immigration. You know, we have gangs in Los Angeles and Chicago and other places, where they're all illegal immigrants.
These are tough dudes. They are gone before I even start the wall. They are gone. They're out of here. They're out of here. They're out of here. And I will tell you, we have some people in this country not supposed to be here. We're not putting them in our prisons so that we can take care of them for the next 45 years.
We're bringing them back where they came, they're never coming back in and let their country take care of them because we're not paying the bill. So this all blends now in because that's been one of my big points. I think trade maybe is my biggest point because I'm so tired of seeing our country lose the jobs, lose the money, lose the base, lose everything.
But right now, because of what's happening and because of what happened in Paris, I mean think of this. Think of this. Nobody wants to say it. I'm the only one that says it. I tell the truth. You know why tell the truth? Because hey, if it doesn't work, it's OK. I loved my life. I'm doing something that's I just feel it's important.
I was asked yesterday, why are you doing it? I'm not doing it for myself. I had a really nice life. I'm going around from place to place to place. But -- Thank you. I'm doing it because, first of all, we don't have much time left. But second of all, I honestly believe we can make our country greater than it's ever been.
I really believe that. With commonsense and intelligent, we can be greater than it's ever been. So what's happened on immigration is just all blending in now with the migration. The migration is a catastrophe. And you have hundreds and thousands of -- you have people want to pour into all of these countries.
Merkel, you have to see what's happening in Germany. They're having riots in Germany. What the hell is she thinking? What she thinking? They're having tremendous crime with that inhabiting. They're having villages overrun. But listen. This could be the great Trojan horse of all time. Because you look at the migration, study it, look at it. Now they'll start infiltrating with women and children.
But you look at that migration and I'm looking at it and I'm the first one to bring it up. Three weeks ago, I'm sitting. I'm saying, isn't that a shame. And then I said to myself, wow. They're all men. There were no men. You look at it. There are so few women and there are so few children. And not only are they men, they're young men and they're as strong as can be. They're tough looking cookies.
I say, what's going on here? And then you look at what, five or six people did in Paris. And we have to get smart. I just had a press conference. I said we have to get smart. They said, the mastermind, the mastermind, he's scum. He's not mastermind. He's scum. He's scum. The press plays right into their hands.
The press is calling the leader of the pack in Paris a mastermind. So all these kids are sitting home even in New York and in California and in Massachusetts, oh the mastermind. He must -- he's not a mastermind. He's a low life. This is just a low-life guy. He's a bum. He's a bum. I'll bet he doesn't have a 90 IQ. You take a look at this guy and they're talking about he's a mastermind.
I just told him at the press conference. I said, you've got to stop calling these people masterminds. We have to take back the Internet. There's so many things we have to do. We have a president that doesn't have a clue. We have a president that says ISIS is contained. He's contained. The only thing contained is us. We're contained because we have no leadership.
But we have to take back the Internet. It's ours. But they've taken over the Internet. They're using the Internet better than we do. They're using the Internet and they're recruiting people. And then the people go out to fight for ISIS. And then we let them back into the country. We let them back in. Where have you been?
I've been fighting for ISIS. Oh come on back in. Go back home to Texas. No, no how stupid are we? When they leave the country, when they go to fight for ISIS or Al-Qaida or whoever the hell they fight, they never ever come back into this country again. Ever. Ever. But we've got to take back the Internet because they are taking people.
They're literally brainwashing people. They're brainwashing our youth. And they're getting it to say like, oh, this is what they want to do. We can't let that happen. We have innocent youth and they're misguided and they're brought along. But then they hear the press talking about these people like Robin Hood.
We can't allow the press to do that. We can't allow it to happen. We have to take back our country. We have to take back our intelligence. We have to take back the Internet. We can't let this happen. Recently -- Jeb Bush. Recently -- it's over. I don't want to waste a lot of time on him because it's over.
It's over. And you know what, I think he's a nice person. Who cares. Who cares? Who cares? But recently he said, Donald Trump's tone is very tough. That's what we need. We need tough tone. And I said, we have people in the Middle East and all over having their heads cut off. James Foley, who I think was an amazing guy.
I got to know his parents. I got to know his parents. They're incredible people. Their son's head was cut off. That was the beginning. They're chopping off heads. You're a Christian, they chop off your head. They chop off heads of everybody. They drown them in cages. They -- we haven't had anything. This has never happened.
Maybe the Middle Ages, maybe Medieval Times. You used to read about it. You know you used to read about medieval times. There's never been anything like this. I said, don't go into Iraq. I was right. I said, now we got to go and we got to knock the shit out of these people. You got to do it. We've got to do it. And we can do it fast and we can do it furious.
We can do it. We can do it well. We can win there again. I watched on television. I talk about it all the time. I see our generals being interviewed on television. I don't want generals interviewed on television. I want to be unpredictable. You know, we're predictable. We're predictable. I want to be unpredictable.
You know, all the polls say, I'd be the best at the military. I'd be the best at foreign policy, which is interesting because if you read the front page of The New York Times today, they said about Ben Carson that he's unable to understand foreign policy. You know his people actually said this that he is unable to comprehend or understand foreign policy.
It was a devastating -- search all over the place. And if you watched over the weekend, you would understand exactly what they're talking about because it was devastating when you watch the interview. But he's unable to comprehend foreign policy. We can't do this. I think he's a nice guy, probably. Who knows?
I don't care. I don't care. We need somebody that sharp and tough and smart and can figure it out fast. Fast. I mean we're playing games. We're playing games. The problem we have is we're playing games. We don't have the luxury of going through what we've gone through for the last seven years with this guy.
This guy was not suited to be president of the United States. He wasn't. I mean, I talked about -- I talked about Ben the other day and I talked about his book. Somebody said, no, you're too tough. So I'll do it very quickly because I went in Iowa. I talked for 15 minutes. I said, oh that was too tough. It's not a question being tough.
He wrote a book. He said, he's got pathological disease. OK. That's a problem to me. Problem. He said, he hit or tried to hit his mother over the head with a hammer. I didn't. Me, Mary McLeod? No way. I didn't. He said, he tried to stab somebody. Hit the belt buckle. No belt buckle. Stop it. Because they're gonna twist and turn and slide and it's going in. The strong guy goes like this.
It's going in. It's not stopping. It might be detoured a little bit but it's going in. He said he hit somebody really a very good friend of his in the face really, really hard with a padlock. Boom, in his face, did a lot of damage. And that's why they want to elect him and he's trying to prove that he did it. And I'm saying, I think if I was him, I'd try and prove that I didn't do it. I don't get the whole deal.
I don't get it. I don't get it. What are we coming to? What is the country coming through? We need sharp. We need smart. We need brilliant. We need tough. We've got to get the right guy. We need Trump. Yes. So then today, they come out with a Time story and you should read it. And by the way, Times and many other papers.
Not just the Times. If it was the Times, I would say, don't believe, may be. But it's many papers, talking about he cannot comprehend what's going on. That's bad. That's real bad. Can you imagine that if somebody goes in office and then you realize that he really cannot figure it out. We got a problem. Yes, we have Obama.
That's right. He's never figured it out. And then we have others. I mean they're running. They're running but they're not the right people. They're not the right people. You know, I've made a tremendous amount of money. I've built a great company. Remember when they said, he'll never run. Then I ran. Then they said, he'll never file Form A. That's basically one page.
But basically, you're signing your life away. I signed it. They go on like, oh. Then they said, oh well, he'll never file his financials because you're giving all these -- you could file forever. You could take forever. You get all these delays and everything. They'll say, he'll ask for the longest delay.
Well, I have the longest biggest financial statement ever filed in the history of the federal elections and I filed it ahead of schedule. No, it's true. You're given 30 days to file and then you're giving many extensions and everybody said, oh he'll just keep extending and then he'll drop out because maybe he's not as rich as people thought.
Well, I filed it and it turned out I'm much richer, right? You see. Much richer. And I don't do that. You know what much richer. Oh the press was devastated. They couldn't believe the numbers. They couldn't believe it. Longest statement. I think was 98 pages, almost 100 pages. Whereas, a politician it's like one page.
They did a book and they got, you know, a couple of bucks for it, but they did something. So I did this tremendous thing -- what they don't know is that I didn't even know if I was gonna run. Because it took -- you know, when I came down, I took a deep breath I went like this to my wife. Man, look at that down there.
The press was like crazy. The whole atrium was packed with press. I said, ayayayay. And I went like this. You ever do this when you have something where you're just not 100%. And you're saying, oh should I be doing this? My whole life is gonna change. My family's life. And I went like this, let's go baby.
That's what happened. That's what happened. And we went down that famous escalator. We went down that escalator and here we are. Here we are. But what they don't know is that if I didn't run, I was gonna file the financials anyway because I'm so proud of them. They're so good. I was so proud of it. So it shows an unbelievable company, unbelievable assets, the most iconic Doral, buildings in Manhattan, 40 Wall Street, Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue.
All over the place. The Bank of America building a big chunk in San Francisco, one of the great buildings of the world. Many, many things. Land all over the place on the Potomac River, on the Pacific Ocean. Very little debt, tremendous cash flow. They said, oh, they were devastated. They were devastated.
They had one guy. You have boxes and you check in. It says, $1 million, $2 million, $5 million. Actually starts with $5,000. They're various boxes. $10 million. $20 million. Then they go $25 million. Then they go $50 million or more. So I have many buildings worth much more than that. So -- but you check.
$50 million or more. So I check the box. I didn't check. My accountants check, right? They checked the box. Many of these -- I think it's like 23 or 24 boxes, $50 million or more. So we have a couple of guys they added up the 50s. And that was what they said my net worth is. In other words, you have a building that's worth a billion and a half in New York City or someplace and you put -- there's no category.
It's worth more than 50. So say check. Boom. And I ended up with a net worth of all those boxes times, x 50 million times 23 or 24. And I said that's so dishonest. But it didn't matter to me because the real people understood it. And then it was also reported fortunately fairly by some. But I would have put in the financials anyway because they turned out to be great.
And the reason I talk about the financials is this. I don't care. I'm a private company. Nobody knew what it was worth because as a private company, you didn't -- you have guys write books about Trump. They don't know anything. They don't know what I'm worth. Now they'd know what I'm worth because I see this financial disclosure, which is certified and big deal.
It's a big deal. Filed with the federal government. But the reason I talk about it is not braggadocio, it's simple. We need that thinking in this country. I don't care about me. We need that thinking in the country. We need somebody that's not gonna allow an Iran deal to be made. We need somebody that's a negotiator.
I did write The Art of the Deal, but forget that. We need somebody that's -- Carl Icahn, the great businessman endorsed me the other day. We need -- Carl is a good man. A lot of you know Carl. Great. Many of the people who just -- they want me to win because they know I'm like really good at this stuff. And we need -- and I talk to you this way, I talk to you this way because that's the mentality whether I'm nice or not.
I think I'm nice actually. But whether I am or not, we've got to take our country back. We've got to turn our country around. We need that kind of thinking. Whatever that thinking is. Whatever that thinking is we need it. We can't give -- I mean, our deal, I use it all the time. It's not a financial deal though, you could say it's even financial.
But we can't get Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty rotten traitor, and give them, and give them five of the greatest killers on Earth that they've been after for nine years. But that's the deal. So we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and we knew he was a traitor and six people, six young great people were killed going after this bum.
Six people. Now in the old days -- there's my man stand up. What do we do with Sergeant Bergdahl 50 years ago? That's right. Boom. Boom. A great veteran, boom. He's gone. He's gone. Six people killed looking for Bergdahl. And we give five people to get it back. And we knew that he was a traitor because they had a general and a colonel go and interview, all of the soldiers that he dealt with and that he was with, they said he deserted.
So they knew -- you know, it's one thing they made a mistake, but they knew. We can't do things like that anymore. And by the way, on Bergdahl, I say the other day. No time. They don't want to give me any time. They're letting them out. They're not gonna not only not shoot him. They let him out. They said, well, he's been through a lot.
Oh yeah. He's been through a lot. Six young great people died looking for him and he's recommended to get nothing. Zero. And we can't let that happen anymore. So when I talk about myself because I've had an amazing life. I mean I've had a successful life. The Apprentice became one of the great shows on television.
I left The Apprentice. I left so much. You know, it's funny. The Apprentice has been so great. Everybody watch The Apprentice. I guess, right? So NBC calls. Steve Burke, the head of Comcast, who's a great guy, came up to my office. Please, Donald do it again. Do it again, please. I said, Steve, I want to run.
I want to run. Top people at NBC, top people at Comcast, great people. And Steve is a fantastic guy. He came. He said, please do it again. They wanted me to do it again. Mark Burnett called me. Please do it again. Everybody. Everybody takes a renewal. You'll be like the only one that didn't take a renewal.
Are you crazy? I said, Mark, I really want to run because I think I can do a great job. So when I filed my financial disclosure you're not gonna believe this. I had all these guys. Well, he doesn't make much money with The Apprentice. So here's what -- certified numbers. I made $213 million doing the apprentice.
Can you believe it? No. Think of it. Think of it. $213 million because we got the ads. I own the show with Mark and the whole thing. $213 million is what I put on my statement. Now these, you know, guy, said oh you know. They didn't believe it until they saw the number that it's a certified number. One of them on MSNBC used to go. Well, he doesn't make any money with The Apprentice.
So anyway, so think of it. I made all that money. They want to extend for 28 shows. And I said, no. I'm not gonna do it. And that's the least of it. So I give up a lot. You know these guys, these politicians don't give up anything. They run, they lose. They win, they run. They keep running. It's all they do. They run.
They talk. They're nothing. They're nothing. They can't do anything. They can't bring us to the promised land. They can't do it. It's not in their genes. I talk about corporate inversions. Companies are leaving our country. They used to leave New York for Florida. They used to leave Massachusetts actually.
They used to leave -- I hate to say, they used to leave for Mexico. They did -- that was pretty stupid, I will say, but we wouldn't let that stuff happen. We wouldn't let it happen. But they used to leave. Plenty left New Hampshire plenty left, as you know, for Mexico. Plenty left Massachusetts. But now, companies are gonna leave our country with thousands and thousands of jobs left behind and abandoned because of our tax code, because of the complexity.
There's $2.5 trillion offshore outside of this country. They can't get their money back because of the complexity of the code and because of the amount they have to pay. They're leaving and they're gonna go to the money. And they're gonna leave all the jobs and they're gonna get lower taxes. We can't let this happen.
And I talk to these guys on the stand. These people on the stand. They don't even know what the hell I'm talking about. They're politicians. They're good at one thing, getting reelected. That's all they're good for. I see these people. I see them. I look at Rubio, he's a lightweight. He's a lightweight. Everyone say, oh Rubio, he's the next Reagan.
He's no Reagan, that I can tell you. No he's not a Reagan. I don't mind. Hey, he's a young guy. Maybe he'll do well. I mean my hair is better than his hair. That I can tell. And I'm a little older. I'm a little old. But now these people are not gonna bring you. They're not gonna take us where you want to go. They're not gonna do it. They're politicians.
All talk, no action. Nothing gets done. They control by special interests. It's not gonna happen, folks. It's not gonna happen. It's time. It's time to really bite the bullet and do it right. We got to do it right. We got to do it right. And I want to be tough and I want to be strong and I want to do these things.
Because if we don't do it, we're not gonna have a country left. We're just not gonna have a country left. Not gonna happen. Obamacare, a disaster. No, it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Obamacare, premiums are up 35%, 45%, 55%. Deductibles are through the roof. You don't even get to use it. The deductibles are so high.
People are getting killed. And it was all a lie. 28 times, you can keep your doctor, keep your plan, everything is wonderful. Even the Democrats were lied to because they would've never approved it. But the president kept saying, great. Everything you can have. And yet, they don't have to use it. The politicians in Washington don't have to use because they don't want it because it's no good.
We are going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with something great, with something great. So sad. So sad when you look at it. When you see that. Remember the website? Everyone forgets it. Now, you know, the one problem in politics, it's got like a two-week life. Everybody forgets how bad. Remember the website?
$5 billion web site that didn't work. Still does it work. A $5 billion web site. Those days are gone. Those days are gone. I would have gotten Microsoft. I would have gotten somebody. I would have gotten Yahoo!. I would have gotten any. I could have gotten 10 different companies that are the best in the world.
They would have done it for nothing. They would have been so honored to do it. We spend hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars doing a web site that doesn't work. And everybody now forgets it. Obamacare has to be repealed. You know, in '17, it's going to cost, it's going to cost our country an absolute fortune.
It's going to be useless as far as you're concerned. The deductibles will be so high you're not gonna be able to use it and the cost is gonna be prohibitive. So they're already saying they have to go back to Congress in '17 to redo it, to change it. We're gonna get rid of it. We're gonna get something good.
You know who made the money with Obamacare? Other than the fact that the people that designed the web sites were very close to you know who? Right? You know that. But you know I made the money with Obamacare? The insurance companies. They gave a tremendous amount of money to Obama. The insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare.
Take a look at them. Take a look at these insurance companies. They're raking in billions of dollars with Obamacare, and nobody even knows it. So we're gonna get rid of it. We're gonna come up with a plan that's so good. There's so many ideas, so many plans and it's gonna be good. And you're gonna have your doctor and you're gonna have your plan.
You're gonna have what you want. So the other day I was watching the Democrat. It's actually the Democrat debate. You know, they call it the Democratic debate because it sounds better. It's not really the -- it's called the Democrat debate. And I watched Hillary, who doesn't have the strength or the stamina to be president.
I can tell. Doesn't have this. No, doesn't have it. She doesn't have the strength or the stamina. We need very strong right now. She's exhausted, folks. She's exhausted. In fact, I think, if she pulls it off, I think her greatest achievement ever will be getting out of the email scandal. I think that will be her greatest achievement.
And I think she will do it because I think she's being totally protected by the Democrats. They've destroyed General Petraeus. They've put other people in jail for doing 5% of what she did. And I think that she's gonna get a free pass. I think the Democrats are protecting her because they think you can't vote, you can't vote for Bernie.
Did you hear that? The Paris attacks were caused by -- Did you hear this one? The Paris attacks were caused, according to Bernie Sanders, they were caused by global warming. And the other guy, he shouldn't even be on the stage, he was the mayor of Baltimore. He did a great job, OK? So we have issues. We have 93 million people out of the labor force.
Think of it. When you have 5.2%, forget it. When you add the real numbers, you probably have a 25% unemployment. And I'll tell you, this place is packed. People are still coming in. Oh, those poor people. They're gonna be so angry when I finish and they're still coming in. People -- can you believe people are still coming in? Let's give them a hand.
Give those people a hand. We love those people. They're gonna say, how did Mr. Trump do tonight? How was the speech? They're gonna say, I don't know. We never got in. So we have 93 million people out of the labor force. We have 50 million people in poverty. We have 43 million and now, it's actually gonna be probably closer to 50. 50 million people on food stamps.
And I'll tell you what, if we had a real, if we had a real -- Hello. Hello. You know, it's amazing. I mentioned food stamps and that guy, who is seriously overweight, went crazy. He went crazy. Amazing. That's an amazing sight. You know the bad part? Here's the bad thing. So we had three little protests.
Each person, I think it was one over there, one over here, one over there, right? So we had three people tonight. Three, right? Three. Three people. So we had three people and the press will say, protestor Trump. We didn't have. We got. We have 12,000 people and they're gonna take three -- with 12,000 people still coming in and they're gonna take three people, these people.
They're gonna take three people and say, oh, the protests were unbelievable. Unbelievable. You know it's like Saturday Night Live. Anybody see Saturday Night Live? Good. That was good. Well, I heard about the protests. And I said, oh, it's gonna be tough. This is gonna be tough. So I said one of my guys out and I heard every newscast, there will be major protests tonight in front of NBC at Rockefeller Center.
The protests will be unbelievable. I said, you know, we've been going through a side door. It is gonna be rough tonight. This is gonna be rough. So we look and there were like 20 people outside. I sent my guy. I said go check it again. You must be wrong. Comes back. He said, 21 people total. He found, he found one.
Then just before I went on. I said go check it again. There was no. You know why? They went home to watch Saturday Night Live. Is this crazy? Crazy. But the press, the press was reporting massive protests against Trump. It's really horrible. It's really, really horrible, really dishonest. And honestly, you're talking about three people.
One, two, three, right? Three people. They weren't even in a group because who the hell wants to be with a guy like that to be in a group? Who? Seriously? Who wants to be with him? Nobody. Nobody. Nobody will have him. Nobody. But -- so tomorrow, when you go home and tonight, when you watch your broadcast.
You're gonna hear about protests. You're gonna hear that there were protesters outside. I didn't see them. I saw thousands of people trying to come in. Thousands. That line. I never saw that line was four blocks long, five deep. But you're gonna hear about protests and just remember what I said. It's all a big lie.
It's a big lie. It's a terrible, terrible lie. It's a terrible, terrible lie. So I just want to close by saying, very shortly, you're fired. I just want to close by saying, look, I've given up a lot to do this. I've given up a tremendous amount. I've given up a lot of deals and economics and shows, a lot of other things.
But what I want to say is, we're gonna win if. I get elected, we're gonna win on trade. We're gonna win with ISIS. And boy, are we gonna win with them and we're gonna do it fast. We're gonna win with our military. We're gonna take care of our veterans. We're gonna take care of our veterans. We're gonna do great with our health care.
It's gonna be the finest in the land. The finest. And I can only say this. You have to remember this night. You are going to have something special. We are gonna bring back our country. I used to say the silent majority. It's not the silent majority. It used to be the silent majority. This is a very, very vocal majority.
You have to keep it going. But we are going to have victory. We're gonna have victories economically. We're gonna have victories on trade. We're gonna put our people back to work. We're not gonna let other countries steal our jobs. It's not gonna happen anymore. We're gonna have great health care. The American Dream is dead, but we're gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever, ever, ever before.
And we're gonna make America great again. I love you. I love you. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I love you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
","Speech: Donald Trump Delivers a Speech in Worcester, MA",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-worcester-ma-november-18-2015
John Hutton,United Kingdom,2015-12-02,"I’m grateful for the opportunity to join you today.
These annual Saver Summits – now in their fifth year – together with the State of the Nation’s Savings reports – have played a crucial role in driving the debate over how to tackle the challenge of under saving and helping to bring it to the forefront of public consciousness.
A year ago today, on the eve of the publication of the Pension Commission’s 2nd report, I set out in a speech what I believed to be five key tests for a successful future pensions system. I said it needed to promote personal responsibility; to be fair – especially to women and carers; to be simple to understand; affordable and sustainable for the long term.
Next week the Government will introduce a Pensions Bill to meet those five tests – and in doing so, change fundamentally the landscape of this nation’s Pensions system.
Our goal is to promote personal responsibility for dignity and security in old age. And the Pensions Bill will help to do this by creating a simpler and more generous state pension system.
We will restore the earnings link so that the Basic State Pension will retain its value over time and act as a stable platform upon which people can save for retirement;
We will simplify the second state pension;
We will modernise the contributory principle so that more women and carers get a better deal;
We will take the first steps towards a new system of personal accounts to make it easier for people to save;
And we will introduce a higher state pension age so that we keep the proportion of adult life spent receiving the state pension stable for each generation.
Together, these measures will help to secure the long-term financial stability and sustainability of the pensions system.
The Pensions Bill will make pensions fairer for women and carers – replacing Home Responsibilities Protection with a new deal of weekly credits for carers; reducing the number of years needed to qualify for the Basic State Pension to 30; and introducing a new modernised contributory principle so that for the first time, a life of social contribution will be recognised and rewarded on an equal footing with a life of work.
Today less than a third of women reaching state pension age get a full state pension. In 2010, as a result of these reforms, it will be over 70%. By 2020, 90%.
The legislation will go further than the May White Paper in simplifying the State Second Pension to create a more transparent and simpler overall state pension package.
Instead of the current system where State Second Pension is calculated based on how much someone earns in a year, we will replace this – at the same time as linking the Basic State Pension to earnings – with a fixed amount of money that everyone will receive, based upon the amount of time they have spent working or caring for someone.
This will mean people receiving £1.40 a week on top of their Basic State Pension for each qualifying year spent either working, caring, or doing a combination of both.
It will give people a much clearer picture of what they will receive from the state in retirement. And when added together with the Basic State Pension, this simplified entitlement could effectively provide a single State Pension for most contributors.
So, for example, by the 2050s someone who contributed for most of their life through working or caring would be entitled to around £135 a week from state pensions in retirement – instead of between £90 and £100. And because they could be confident of that entitlement lifting them clear of means-tested benefits they would also be able to plan their private saving.
The introduction of a new lost-cost system of personal accounts combined with mandatory matching minimum employer contributions and automatic enrolment will give future generations an unprecendented opportunity to take personal responsibility for building that private saving – and helping to embed a new pensions savings culture.
At least 7 million people are not saving enough for their retirement. Many are from low income households and the majority are likely to be women. It’s an area where existing pension products have not served this potential market well.
Personal accounts will rectify this. It’s expected that between 6 and 10 million people could save into personal accounts – particularly low to moderate earners who do not currently save in a private pension. By retirement, their pension funds could be worth up to around 25% more because of lower charges. And it’s estimated that personal accounts will generate an additional £4-5 billion of new saving – equivalent to around half a per cent of GDP.
So by 2050 a regular saver – saving into a personal account from age 25 with total contributions of 8% and on median earnings – could be up to £50 a week better off than if the system continued as it is today. Additionally our changes to limit the spread of means-testing, will help provide the right incentives on which to build personal saving. By 2050 only about a third of pensioners will be eligible for pension credit and only about 6% of these will be receiving the guarantee credit alone – so in the vast majority of cases those receiving pension credit will actually be rewarded for voluntary saving.
While there will always be specific individual circumstances which will affect people’s savings – fundamentally our package of reforms will mean that people should be better off in retirement by having saved.
And that is the crucial point. Personal Accounts and auto-enrolment will help to facilitate personal responsibility. The goal of our policy is to give people a good expectation that if they contribute to the state system for most of their career, they will be better off for having saved. Whether they save – will remain the individual’s decision. And it will be crucial that we have clear, generic information to enable people to judge whether or not it will be in their interests to remain in personal accounts.
Next week’s Pension’s Bill will provide for the creation of a Personal Accounts Delivery Authority – an independent body that will in the first instance advise Government on the design of the operational structure of these accounts and provide support to get the necessary contractual arrangements in place.
We will seek to use the best experience and skills of the private sector to deliver the scheme – and give a significant degree of autonomy in operational decision making. This is very much a first step. We will outline how we would propose to expand the remit and responsibities of this authority in our Personal Accounts White Paper next month.
This White Paper will also set out in detail the choice of model to deliver personal accounts. Since May there has been a very helpful debate and discussion, to which the ABI and its members have contributed in a very constructive way.
The White Paper will set out our views on the best way forward. Today I want to make three things clear:
Firstly – private sector expertise will be crucial to the success of personal accounts – which is one reason why the new delivery authority is so important. And we envisage that personal accounts will be delivered by the private sector.
Secondly, that we should strive to incorporate a proper opportunity for savers to exercise choice over the management of their fund and that this will be one of the prinicpal responsibilities of the delivery authority.
And thirdly, we must guard against ‘mission creep’. The system of personal accounts needs to be focussed on its target market. They are designed in order to fill a gap in the existing market, not substitute for it.
Because it’s not about one type of provision at the expense of another – but actually about supporting the widest range of suitable options that will allow people to plan and achieve the income in retirement that they want.
The Pensions Commission recognised the importance of getting this right and floated ideas around restricting transfers between personal accounts and existing pension vehicles; and imposing an annual limit on contributions into a personal account. This is something that ABI have rightly highlighted with their own five tests – and we are looking at this very carefully ahead of the White Paper.
But protecting existing provision isn’t just about the safeguards put in place to ring-fence personal accounts. Supporting good quality existing employer provision is also about reducing the regulatory burden and making the existing system simpler for employers and providers.
We have already set out measures which, over the next three or four years, will deliver year on year reductions in administrative burdens. And we will set targets for reducing the burdens arising from requirements for businesses to provide information.
But we are determined to go further in removing unnecessary regulation and simplifying regulatory burdens wherever we can. That’s why, as well as the abolition of contracting out for defined contribution schemes and the change to allow occupational pension schemes to convert Guaranteed Minimum Pension rights into scheme benefits – we’re taking forwards a rolling deregulatory review. This, I believe, offers the potential for radical change. Not merely to re-write legislation – but a real opportunity to cut red tape and to make it easier to deliver workplace pensions.
The final but possibly most significant part of next week’s Bill is to legislate for gradually raising the State Pension Age to 68 by 2046. It is a big step to ask one parliament to set a course for forty years. But it is the right thing to do. We need to lock in stability in pensions policy to allow future generations to plan ahead with confidence. We need to be straight with people on this crucial issue so they know where they stand and can plan accordingly.
Over the last fifty years, there has been a seismic shift in the balance between the proportions of life spent in work and retirement. In 1950, of those men that made it to retirement, the average age for stopping work was 67, and they then had an average of 10 years in retirement. Today not only do the vast majority of men survive to retirement, the average age they retire is actually 64, and at that point they can expect to spend another 21 years in retirement.
As unpopular as it may be to talk about working longer – the simple fact is that if we aren’t prepared to increase the state pension age, we will simply pass an ever greater and frankly unsustainable burden onto our children and grandchildren.
We’re not alone in grappling with this issue – the ageing population is a truly global phenomenon for all of the developed countries. In the US the pension age has already started increasing and will reach 67 in 2027; it is increasing from 60 to 65 in Japan. And it has recently been increased in 6 EU countries including Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
The UK can not remain immune to this process of change. In fact in the UK people are already working longer. Two thirds of new jobs currently are taken by older workers.
If we are serious about preparing the country to meet long term demographic challenges, raising the state pension age cannot be ducked.
The reforms in next week’s Pensions Bill make up an integrated package. We cannot pick and choose from within this package to avoid the tough choices. Those who want to change some element of the reforms need to explain how they could do so without jeopardising those key outcomes of fairness, simplicity and affordability.
Those who would oppose the increase in the State Pension Age, for example, must do so in the full knowledge of the predicted consequences. If we do not increase State Pension Age, it is the equivalent of a 4p rise in the Basic Rate of income tax in 2050 to pay for a population spending more and more of their lives in retirement.
We have said we will keep the increase in state pension age under review in the years ahead, particularly in regard to life expectancy in the most deprived areas in Britain, where health and longevity has so far improved more slowly than the richest.
But when around a quarter of men in Manchester and Liverpool die before reaching 65 it’s clear that the pension age is only part of the picture. Life expectancy is rising for all socio-economic groups – but we need to continue investing more in improving people’s health throughout life – and especially in areas which have traditionally suffered greater deprivation. You don’t deal with differences in life expectancy through the pension system. You do it through more effective public health strategies, early intervention to tackle the route causes of child poverty, effective childcare, education, skills, opportunities to work, the promotion of inter-generational social mobility.
But we also need to remember in this debate about the State Pension Age that life expectancy is increasing in all parts of the country. In Scotland, for example, where life expectancy has been lower, longevity is now expected to improve faster than in other parts of the UK. And the increase in State Pension Age to 68 will still leave men in Scotland with a longer period of time above the pension age.
Yet again, this year’s Saver Summit comes at a crucial point for pensions reform. It’s been a period of extraordinary change. In one year we’ve gone from the Pensions Commission report to a landmark Bill and a set of proposals for personal accounts that will transform the opportunities to save for those who – as this summit’s research has highlighted on many occasions – have simply not been saving enough for their future.
The more traditional approach of the centre left to this problem would have been to compel people to save, to lock their savings into a social insurance fund that they couldn’t see or understand how it related to them.
Personal accounts will be different. They will help people to save rather than compel them; the accounts will be transparent – it will be their money, not Government’s.
We will give people choices over which funds to invest and auto-enrolment will secure economies of scale so that individuals will benefit from lower charges. Collective means to realise individual ends.
The challenge now is to deepen the consensus we have built around the key elements of next week’s Bill – and to ensure the effective design of the new personal accounts. The next twelve months represent an historic opportunity. By this time next year, we will have cemented the path for the long-term future of pensions in this country.
I look forward to continuing to work with you as we take these steps towards a sustainable, affordable and trusted pensions settlement which will meet the challenges of social and demographic change and enable both this and future generations to save for a long and healthy retirement.

Hillary Clinton,United States of America,2007-03-04,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. And I want to begin by giving praise to the Almighty for the blessings he has bestowed upon us as a congregation, as a people, and as a nation. and I thank you so much, Reverend Armstrong, for welcoming me to this historic church.
And I thank the First Baptist Church family for opening your hearts and your home to me and to so many visitors today. I have to confess that I did seek dispensation from Reverend Armstrong to come because you know, I'm a Methodist. And I'm in one of those mixed marriages. And my husband, who sends greetings to all of you today, felt it necessary to call the Reverend to make sure that was all right. And thank you, reverend, for being so broad-minded and understanding.
It is also a great honor to be here with so many distinguished members of the clergy, elected officials, leaders of the civil rights movement, today, tomorrow, and yesterday. President Steele, I could have listened all afternoon. That pulse that you found so faint you have brought back to life. And all of us owe you and SCLC a great deal of gratitude.
I think everybody in the sanctuary has been introduced. But I want to just say a word of recognition to some of my colleagues in government who have traveled a long way to be here with us today. Congressman Rahm Emanuel from Illinois and his son Zach. Congressman Anthony Weiner from New York. Congresswoman Gwendolyn Moore from Wisconsin. Congressman Linda Sanchez from California. And the chair of all the mayors in the country, Mayor Palmer from Trenton, New Jersey. I thank them for coming to join with us.
And I have to say, Chairman Chestnut, thank you for the history lesson and for the welcome. I thank all of the board of deacons, the board of trustees and the deaconesses and I appreciate that we are gathered here for another commemoration that is important for us once again to re-enact so we never forget.
I also want to ask for our prayers on behalf of all those who lost their lives in the terrible tornadoes that swept through this state and others and particularly for those young people, those eight students of Enterprise High School who lost their lives, for their families, and on behalf of all those who may still be missing.
I come here this morning as a sister in worship, a grateful friend and beneficiary of what happened in Selma 42 years ago. I come to share the memories of a troubled past and a hope for a better tomorrow.
One that is worthy of the sacrifices that were made here. Today marks that 42nd anniversary. but it also marks, as we have heard, the 50th anniversary of SCLC and the 50th anniversary of the integration of Central High by the Little Rock Nine.
And I have friends with me today from Arkansas who have been with my husband and me for all those years. We know, as President Steele reminded us, that America's march to freedom, equality and opportunity has been marked by milestones -- milestones like the creation of SCLC and the integration of Central High and that fateful Sunday with that march across the Pettis Bridge. But those are just milestones. They do not mark the end of the journey. In fact, it is not over yet. and I believe that for many people today who are mistaken that Bloody Sunday is a subject for the history books, it is our responsibility to make it clear to them it is just as relevant today as it was 42 years ago.
Yes, that long march to freedom that began here has carried us a mighty long way. But we all know we have to finish the march. That is the call to our generation, to our young people. As a young girl, I had the great privilege of hearing Dr. King speak in Chicago. The year was 1963. My youth minister from our church took a few of us down on a cold January night to hear someone that we had read about, we had watched on television, we had seen with our own eyes from a distance, this phenomenon known as Dr. King.
He titled the sermon he gave that night ""Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution."" some of you may have heard it because he delivered it more than once. He described how the literary character Rip Van Winkle had slept through the American Revolution. And he called on us, he challenged us that evening to stay awake during the great Revolution that the Civil Rights Pioneers were waging on behalf of a more perfect union.
It was sweeping our country, and we would sleep through it at our risk and detriment. Now, I know we've been at this a long time. And after all the hard work, getting rid of the literacy tests and the poll taxes, fighting for the right to vote, bringing more people into the economic mainstream, a body does get tired.
But we've got to stay awake. we've got to stay awake, because we have a march to finish. a march toward one America, that should be all America was meant to be. That too many people before us have given of themselves time and again, to make real. How can we rest while poverty and inequality continue to rise? How can we sleep, while 46 million of our fellow Americans do not have health insurance? How can we be satisfied, when the current economy brings too few jobs and too few wage increases and too much debt? How can we shrug our shoulders and say this is not about me, when too many of our children are ill-prepared in school for college and unable to afford it, if they wish to attend?
How can we say everything is fine when we have an energy policy whose prices are too high, who make us dependent on foreign governments that do not wish us well, and when we face the real threat of climate change, which is tinkering with God's creation?
How do we refuse to march when we have our young men and women in uniform in harm's way, and whether they come back, their government does not take care of them the way they deserve?
And how do we say that everything is fine, Bloody Sunday is for the history books, when over 96,000 of our citizens, the victims of Hurricane Katrina, are still living in trailers and mobile homes, which is a national disgrace to everything we stand for in America?
You know, Dr. King told us -- Dr. King told us our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. Well, I'm here to tell you poverty and growing inequality matters. Health care matters. the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans matter. Our soldiers matter. Our standing in the world matters. Our future matters, and it is up to us to take it back, put it in to our hands, start marching toward a better tomorrow!
Now, 42 years ago, from this church and from brown, brave men and women first tried to march. Two days later, Dr. King tried again. Getting as far as the bridge. Then on the third day, armed with judge Frank Johnson's order, more than 3,000 people crossed the Pettis Bridge. And by the time they got to Montgomery, they were 25,000 strong.
Now, my friends, we must never forget the blows they took. Let's never forget the dogs and the horses and the hoses that were turned on them, driving them back, treating them not as human beings.
But also don't forget about the dignity with which they bore it all. They understood the right to vote matters. Now, five months later the voting rights act was enacted by Congress and signed by President Johnson, but we all know it was written on the march from Selma to Montgomery.
It was written by men and women with tired feet and swollen ankles. And it was first signed with their blood, sweat, and tears. We cherish the few, including my good friend, Congressman John Lewis, who still remain with us today, to cross the bridge again. But let us not forget those who have passed on -- Dr. King and Coretta, Viola, Ralph Abernathy, Josea Williams and all the others. We remember, too, Jimmy Lee Jackson, whose killing near here was one of the events that ignited the march. and we were the support of this great church and of Reverend Fred, who helped to lead people into justice for all.
So many prayed and stood up for the right to vote. Dr. King said quality for African-Americans would also free white Americans of the staining legacy of slavery. And so it has. In 2000, my husband said here that those who walked across the bridge made it possible for the south to grow and prosper and for two sons of the south, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, to be elected president of the United States.
The Voting Rights Act gave more Americans from every corner of our nation the chance to live out their dreams. And it is the gift that keeps on giving. Today it is giving Senator Obama the chance to run for president of the United States. And by its logic and spirit, it is giving the same chance to Governor Bill Richardson, an Hispanic, and yes, it is giving me that chance, too.
You know, this may be interesting for the legislators who are here, but before Selma and the Voting Rights Act put quality front and center, it was illegal under Alabama law for women to serve on juries. I know where my chance came from, and I am grateful to all of you, who gave it to me.
But in the last two presidential elections we have seen the right to vote tampered with, and outright denied to too many of our citizens, especially the poor and people of color. Not just in Florida, Ohio, and Maryland, but in state after state. The very idea that in the 21st century, African-Americans would wait in line for 10 hours while whites in an affluent precinct next to theirs waited in line for 10 minutes, or that African-Americans would receive fliers telling them the wrong time and day to exercise their constitutional right to vote. That's wrong. It is simply unconscionable that today young Americans are putting their lives at risk to protect democracy half a world away when here at home their precious right to vote is under siege.
My friends, we have a march to finish. I will be reintroducing the Count Every Vote Act, to ensure that every voter is given the opportunity to vote, that every vote is counted, and each voter is given the chance to verify his or her vote before it is cast and made permanent.
We have to stay awake. We have a march to finish. On this floor today, let us say with one voice the words of James Cleveland's great freedom hymn, ""I don't feel no ways tired/I come too far from where I started from/Nobody told me that the road would be easy/I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.""
And we know -- we know -- we know, if we finish this march, what awaits us? St. Paul told us, in the letter to the Galatians, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due seasons we shall reap, if we do not lose heart."" The brave men and women of Bloody Sunday did not lose heart. We can do no less. We have a march to finish. Let us join together and complete that march for freedom, justice, opportunity, and everything America should be. Thank you and God bless you.

George Young,United Kingdom,2017-08-30,"Due to the operations of the Boundary Commission, I have no fewer than three immediate predecessors to whom I must pay tribute in my maiden speech. One of them—Brian Batsford, the former Member for Ealing, South—did not seek re-election. The second—Nigel Spearing, the former Member for Acton—sought re-election and, after a vigorous contest with me at the hustings came second. The third—Mr. Molloy—sought re-election at a modified constituency, Ealing, North, and was duly returned. It does not need me to remind the House of his ceaseless efforts on behalf of those of his former constituents whom I now represent. He may not be very sorry to lose them, because he did not get many votes from that section of the constituency, but a lot of them are sorry to lose him, as he was a tireless and often pugnacious fighter on their behalf.
My predecessor in Acton—Nigel Spearing—earned the high regard and respect of his constituents in the three years in which he represented them. The closeness of the result doubtless reflected the local good will which he accumulated. He is by profession a school teacher, and in view of the current shortage of members of that profession in London, I hope that I have performed some small public service by enabling him to return to his previous vocation.
Brian Batsford represented Ealing, South for 16 years. He was a highly respected and much loved local Member who will be sadly missed. I am very grateful to him for the advice and encouragement which he gave me when I was a candidate.
I am honoured to tread in the collective footsteps of those three men.
I wish to speak briefly about my constituency. It is an amalgam of a highly industrialised area—Acton—with a large section of Ealing, a predominantly residential area with a major shopping centre at Ealing Broadway. Acton has the distinction of having more railway stations to its name than any other place in the country—North Acton, South Acton, East Acton, West Acton, Acton Central, Acton Main Line and Acton Town. It is, none the less, extraordinarily difficult to travel around it by public transport.
As with other industrial areas in London, Acton is suffering from the progressive rundown of industry. Successive Governments have taken the view that London has an inexhaustible supply of industrial firms which can be exported to other parts of the country. As a result, when firms in London wish to expand or modernise, they find that the planning and fiscal incentives to do so are almost irresistible. Consequently, there is a danger of London’s being left with the most inefficient and least modernised firms in the country. If this state of affairs is allowed to continue, it will undermine the economic base of the capital and adversely affect the employment prospects of those who live and work in it.
The Ealing section of the constituency is a pleasant residential area. Its main problem is a disease called planning blight, for which there appears to be no known cure and which can last for 25 years. Indeed, I had some pleasure in tracing back one set of road proposals to the last Liberal Government.
I am honoured to represent this new constituency and hope that it will be many decades before the House has to listen to another maiden speech from the Member for Ealing, Acton.
I wish to speak briefly on one matter concerning the economy, namely, the role of the public sector. Until recently I was an economic adviser in one of the largest nationalised industries—the Post Office Corporation. I was able to observe at first hand the effects of price restraint in this section of the economy. At a time of rising prices any Government will seek to use its influence to keep down prices, and it always does so in the nationalised sector because that is where it has most influence.
Historically, the nationalised industries have been the first to respond—not always willingly—to the call for price restraint. However, we should be under no illusion about the danger of this course of action if allowed to go on for long. First, many of the nationalised industries supply energy—the Central Electricity Generating Board, the National Coal Board and the Gas Council. At a time when the country must economise in its consumption of energy, it is indefensible that energy should be available to private consumer and industry alike at a price which is less than its true cost.
Secondly, pegging prices at low levels artificially increases demand, and in response to this the nationalised industries have put forward ambitious investment programmes. Many of the nationalised industries are capital-intensive and large sums of capital money are needed to increase their output. The two largest nationalised industries plan to spend £8,000 million in the next five years. If their investment plans are based on incorrect assessments of demand there will be a serious misuse of this country’s investment resources.
Morale in the nationalised industries falls if there is continued price restraint leading to substantial losses. Most of the nationalised industries are, in the normal sense, technically bankrupt and it is somewhat dispiriting for management in the nationalised industries to know this and to have to put up with it. Furthermore, the knowledge that the taxpayer will always foot the bill deprives management of the commercial criteria it needs to make sensible decisions.
Finally, price restraint in the nationalised industries has meant that they have had to have recourse to the Treasury for funds in order to keep going and to finance their investments. Not only is continuous Treasury interference in the affairs of the nationalised industries not always a good thing; it has pushed up the borrowing requirement of the Treasury and added to inflationary pressures. The Economist estimated last Friday that current subsidies to the nationalised industries were running at £1,100 million per year. In other words, twice the sum that is apparently available to subsidise food is currently being used to subsidise goods and services because they happen to be produced by the nationalised industries. I see little economic or social logic in this. It will always be difficult to get back to sensible pricing policies for the nationalised industries, but the later we leave it, the more difficult it will become, and in the meantime the greater will be the distortions in our economy.
It is probably too late to influence the Chancellor’s Budget next week, if, indeed, he would welcome any influence from the Conservative benches. But before the right hon. Gentleman commits himself to large increases in personal taxation, perhaps lie will look at the public sector deficits caused by the nationalised industries. If he were to remove these subsidies, the money he would get in would be equivalent to a 15 per cent. increase in personal taxation. Most people would maintain that it is much fairer to remove those subsidies than to put up personal taxation by that amount.

Joe Biden,United States of America,2020-09-29,"How you doing, man?
I’m well.
Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.
The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.
Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.
And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.
He’s elected to the next election.
That’s simply not true.
Open discussion.
Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.
That is simply a lie.
The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.
I am the Democratic Party right now.
The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 20, the 200 mil- the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?
I’m happy to talk about this.
You’re not going to be able to shut him up.
Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-
It’s on the ballot in the court.
In the court.
Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
All right.
Good healthcare.
He has not done healthcare.
Yes.
It is not.
It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare, excuse me, Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.
Look, hey.
I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.
I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.
I’m here standing facing you, old buddy.
All he knows how to do-
Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.
And tonight I’m going to make sure.
Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.
God, I want to make sure-
No, he doesn’t know how to do that.
The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.
There is no manifesto, number one.
Number two.
Number two.
I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.
Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away.
He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.
He has never offered a plan.
He has no plan for healthcare.
He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Sure.
Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.
Vote now.
Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.
I’m not going to answer the question.
Will you shut up, man?
This is so un-Presidential.
That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man.
They sure do.
Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?
He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.
He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan.
I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.
I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.
14,000 people died, not 200,000.
And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?
His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist.
God.
This is the same man who told you-
… by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man.
So here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.
No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.
Everybody knows-
Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. You can trust the-
Yes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way-
By the way-
Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-
Oh, give me a break.
Well, let’s have this debate-
Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-
Will he just shush for a minute?
Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it.
You just admitted you’d shut it down.
I got to respond to that.
I got to respond to that.
Just like your rally.
Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-
Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters.
No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.
He did not say the opposite.
By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you.
No negative effect. Come on.
Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this.
The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.
Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.
Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.
Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.
People want to be safe.
People want to be safe.
Show us your tax returns.
Show us your tax returns.
Release your tax return.
When? Inshallah?
Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.
And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.
Because you weren’t president-
Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.
You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.
Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-
By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.
Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.
Yeah, you got it done-
The economy-
Let me finish.
Not lower tax for the American people.
Look-
… we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.
He blew it.
Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-
… number one. Number two-
Number three.
This guy-
We did not.
I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-
That is not true.
And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-
… with Mexico.
That is not true.
None of that is true.
None of that is true.
Is totally-
Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-
Mr. Vice-
That is not true.
It is not a fact.
It’s been totally discredited.
My son did nothing wrong at Barisma-
He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited-
And you can-
by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies.
By the World Bank-
By everyone, has discredited.
Even the people who testified under oath-
Even the people under-
… testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well.
I did it honorably.
Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-
I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job.
Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person.
No, no. Mr.
That is simply not true.
Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-
This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here.
He didn’t take that.
Try to be honest.
That is absolutely not true.
That’s a good point.
It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that.
Now-
… second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division.
This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.
I’ve never said-
Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out.
We’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.
That is not peaceful protest.
Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist.
Here’s the deal.
The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American.
Oh my Lord.
This is ridiculous.
Absolutely ridiculous.
Violent crime-
I’m in favor of law.
Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.
And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch.
He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.
I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.
Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be…
That is not true.
That’s not true.
We don’t have time to do anything.
I don’t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted.
They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way.
And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about.
I do.
I think Kellyanne Conway.
She said that.
Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time.
Say it, do it say it.
Proud Boys.
His own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-
… not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.
Every body in your administration tells you the truth, it’s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything.
Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.
By the way, my son…
He never keeps his word.
Can you get back 30 seconds?
So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes.
And I resent-
I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?
That’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged.
None of that is true.
That is not true.
My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son.
He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars.
That is not true. That report is totally discredited.
Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason.
So would I.
Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?
He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do…
Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”
Well, he hasn’t drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that-
It’s all true. And here’s the deal-
That is not-
Not true-
Not true.
Not true.
Simply… Look-
That is simply not the case-
What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs.
He doesn’t know how to do that-
The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-
Yeah, he did say that-
And here’s the deal-
… we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord.
For 47-
I did not say that-
Play it. Play it-
Yeah.
The economy-
The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-
Pardon me?
No, I don’t support the Green New Deal.
The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.
Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate.
Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?
There is no evidence of that-
Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes-
I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate.
Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s what’s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process.
He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-
",Donald Trump & Joe Biden 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2020,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020
George Bush,United States of America,1993-01-05 00:00:00,"Thank you all very much. Good luck. Please be seated. Thank you, General Graves, for that very kind introduction. Barbara and I are just delighted to be here and honored that we could be joined by our able Secretary of the Army, Mike Stone; of course, the man well-known here that heads our Army, General Sullivan, General Gordon Sullivan; and Gracie Graves, General Robert Foley, General Galloway; Shawn Daniel, well-known to everybody here, been our host, in a sense; and a West Point alum who has been at my side for 4 years, over here somewhere, General Scowcroft, graduate of this great institution who served his country with such distinction. May I salute the members of the Board of Visitors. I see another I have to single out, General Galvin, who served his country with such honor. And, of course, save the best for last, the Corps of Cadets, thank you for that welcome.
Let me begin with the hard part: It is difficult for a Navy person to come up to West Point after that game a month ago. Go ahead, rub it in. But I watched it. Amazing things can happen in sports. Look at the Oilers, my other team that took it on the chin the other day.
But I guess the moral of all of this is that losing is never easy. Trust me, I know something about that.  But if you have to lose, that's the way to do it: Fight with all you have. Give it your best shot. And win or lose, learn from it, and get on with life.
I am about to get on with the rest of my life. But before I do, I want to share with you at this institution of leadership some of my thinking, both about the world you will soon be called upon to enter and the life that you have chosen.
Any President has several functions. He speaks for and to the Nation. He must faithfully execute the law. And he must lead. But no function, none of the President's hats, in my view, is more important than his role as Commander in Chief. For it is as Commander in Chief that the President confronts and makes decisions that one way or another affects the lives of everyone in this country as well as many others around the world.
I have had many occasions to don this most important of hats. Over the past 4 years, the men and women who proudly and bravely wear the uniforms of the U. S. armed services have been called upon to go in harm's way and have discharged their duty with honor and professionalism.
I wish I could say that such demands were a thing of the past, that with the end of the cold war the calls upon the United States would diminish. I cannot. Yes, the end of the cold war, we would all concede, is a blessing. It is a time of great promise. Democratic governments have never been so numerous. What happened 2 or 3 days ago in Moscow would not have been possible in the cold war days. Thanks to historic treaties such as that START II pact just reached with Russia, the likelihood of nuclear holocaust is vastly diminished.
But this does not mean that there is no specter of war, no threats to be reckoned with. And already, we see disturbing signs of what this new world could become if we are passive and aloof. We would risk the emergence of a world characterized by violence, characterized by chaos, one in which dictators and tyrants threaten their neighbors, build arsenals brimming with weapons of mass destruction, and ignore the welfare of their own men, women, and children. And we could see a horrible increase in international terrorism, with American citizens more at risk than ever before.
We cannot and we need not allow this to happen. Our objective must be to exploit the unparalleled opportunity presented by the cold war's end to work toward transforming this new world into a new world order, one of governments that are democratic, tolerant, and economically free at home and committed abroad to settling inevitable differences peacefully, without the threat or use of force.
Unfortunately, not everyone subscribes to these principles. We continue to see leaders bent on denying fundamental human rights and seizing territory regardless of the human cost. No, an international society, one more attuned to the enduring principles that have made this country a beacon of hope for so many for so long, will not just emerge on its own. It's got to be built.
Two hundred years ago, another departing President warned of the dangers of what he described as ""entangling alliances."" His was the right course for a new nation at that point in history. But what was ""entangling"" in Washington's day is now essential. This is why, at Texas A and M a few weeks ago, I spoke of the folly of isolationism and of the importance, morally, economically, and strategically, of the United States remaining involved in world affairs. We must engage ourselves if a new world order, one more compatible with our values and congenial to our interest, is to emerge. But even more, we must lead.
Leadership, well, it takes many forms. It can be political or diplomatic. It can be economic or military. It can be moral or spiritual leadership. Leadership can take any one of these forms, or it can be a combination of them.
Leadership should not be confused with either unilateralism or universalism. We need not respond by ourselves to each and every outrage of violence. The fact that America can act does not mean that it must. A nation's sense of idealism need not be at odds with its interests, nor does principle displace prudence.
No, the United States should not seek to be the world's policeman. There is no support abroad or at home for us to play this role, nor should there be. We would exhaust ourselves in the process, wasting precious resources needed to address those problems at home and abroad that we cannot afford to ignore.
But in the wake of the cold war, in a world where we are the only remaining superpower, it is the role of the United States to marshal its moral and material resources to promote a democratic peace. It is our responsibility, it is our opportunity to lead. There is no one else.
Leadership cannot be simply asserted or demanded. It must be demonstrated. Leadership requires formulating worthy goals, persuading others of their virtue, and contributing one's share of the common effort and then some. Leadership takes time. It takes patience. It takes work.
Some of this work must take place here at home. Congress does have a constitutional role to play. Leadership therefore also involves working with the Congress and the American people to provide the essential domestic underpinning if U. S. military commitments are to be sustainable.
This is what our administration, the Bush administration, has tried to do. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, it was the United States that galvanized the U. N. Security Council to act and then mobilized the successful coalition on the battlefield. The pattern not exactly the same but similar in Somalia: First the United States underscored the importance of alleviating the growing tragedy, and then we organized humanitarian efforts designed to bring hope, food, and peace.
At times, real leadership requires a willingness to use military force. And force can be a useful backdrop to diplomacy, a complement to it, or, if need be, a temporary alternative.
As Commander in Chief, I have made the difficult choice to use military force. I determined we could not allow Saddam's forces to ravage Kuwait and hold this critical region at gunpoint. I thought then, and I think now, that using military force to implement the resolutions of the U. N. Security Council was in the interest of the United States and the world community. The need to use force arose as well in the wake of the Gulf war, when we came to the aid of the peoples of both northern and southern Iraq. And more recently, as I'm sure you know, I determined that only the use of force could stem this human tragedy of Somalia.
The United States should not stand by with so many lives at stake and when a limited deployment of U. S. forces, buttressed by the forces of other countries and acting under the full authority of the United Nations, could make an immediate and dramatic difference, and do so without excessive levels of risk and cost. Operations Provide Comfort and Southern Watch in Iraq and then Operation Restore Hope in Somalia all bear witness to the wisdom of selected use of force for selective purposes.
Sometimes the decision not to use force, to stay our hand, I can tell you, it's just as difficult as the decision to send our soldiers into battle. The former Yugoslavia, well, it's been such a situation. There are, we all know, important humanitarian and strategic interests at stake there. But up to now it's not been clear that the application of limited amounts of force by the United States and its traditional friends and allies would have had the desired effect, given the nature and complexity of that situation.
Our assessment of the situation in the former Yugoslavia could well change if and as the situation changes. The stakes could grow; the conflict could threaten to spread. Indeed, we are constantly reassessing our options and are actively consulting with others about steps that might be taken to contain the fighting, protect the humanitarian effort, and deny Serbia the fruits of aggression.
Military force is never a tool to be used lightly or universally. In some circumstances it may be essential, in others counterproductive. I know that many people would like to find some formula, some easy formula to apply, to tell us with precision when and where to intervene with force. Anyone looking for scientific certitude is in for a disappointment. In the complex new world we are entering, there can be no single or simple set of fixed rules for using force. Inevitably, the question of military intervention requires judgment. Each and every case is unique. To adopt rigid criteria would guarantee mistakes involving American interests and American lives. And it would give would-be troublemakers a blueprint for determining their own actions. It could signal U. S. friends and allies that our support was not to be counted on.
Similarly, we cannot always decide in advance which interests will require our using military force to protect them. The relative importance of an interest is not a guide: Military force may not be the best way of safeguarding something vital, while using force might be the best way to protect an interest that qualifies as important but less than vital.
But to warn against a futile quest for a set of hard-and-fast rules to govern the use of military force is not to say there cannot be some principles to inform our decisions. Such guidelines can prove useful in sizing and, indeed, shaping our forces and in helping us to think our way through this key question.
Using military force makes sense as a policy where the stakes warrant, where and when force can be effective, where no other policies are likely to prove effective, where its application can be limited in scope and time, and where the potential benefits justify the potential costs and sacrifice.
Once we are satisfied that force makes sense, we must act with the maximum possible support. The United States can and should lead, but we will want to act in concert, where possible involving the United Nations or other multinational grouping. The United States can and should contribute to the common undertaking in a manner commensurate with our wealth, with our strength. But others should also contribute militarily, be it by providing combat or support forces, access to facilities or bases, or overflight rights. And similarly, others should contribute economically. It is unreasonable to expect the United States to bear the full financial burden of intervention when other nations have a stake in the outcome.
A desire for international support must not become a prerequisite for acting, though. Sometimes a great power has to act alone. I made a tough decision -- I might say, on advice of our outstanding military leaders who are so well known to everybody here -- to use military force in Panama when American lives and the security of the Canal appeared to be threatened by outlaws who stole power in the face of free elections. And similarly, we moved swiftly to safeguard democracy in the Philippines.
But in every case involving the use of force, it will be essential to have a clear and achievable mission, a realistic plan for accomplishing the mission, and criteria no less realistic for withdrawing U. S. forces once the mission is complete. Only if we keep these principles in mind will the potential sacrifice be one that can be explained and justified. We must never forget that using force is not some political abstraction but a real commitment of our fathers and mothers and sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors. You've got to look at it in human terms.
In order even to have the choice, we must have available adequate military forces tailored for a wide range of contingencies, including peacekeeping. Indeed, leading the effort toward a new world order will require a modern, capable military, in some areas necessitating more rather than less defense spending. As President, I have said that my ability to deploy force on behalf of U. S. interests abroad was made possible because past Presidents, and I would single out in particular my predecessor, Ronald Reagan, and past Secretaries of Defense sustained a strong military. Consistent with this sacred trust, I am proud to pass on to my successor, President-elect Clinton, a military second to none. We have the very best.
Yet, it is essential to recognize that as important as such factors are, any military is more than simply the sum of its weapons or the state of its technology. What makes any armed force truly effective is the quality of its leadership, the quality of its training, the quality of its people.
We have succeeded abroad in no small part because of our people in uniform. The men and women in our Armed Forces have demonstrated their ability to master the challenges of modern warfare. And at the same time, and whether on the battlefield of Iraq or in some tiny little village in Somalia, America's soldiers have always brought a quality of caring and kindness to their mission. Who will ever forget -- I know I won't -- those terrified Iraqi soldiers surrendering to American troops? And who will forget the way the American soldier held out his arms and said, ""It's okay. You're all right now."" Or in Somalia, the young marine, eyes filled with tears, holding the fragile arm of an emaciated child. There can be no doubt about it: The All Volunteer Force is one of the true success stories of modern day America.
It is instructive to look at just why this is so. At its heart, a voluntary military is based upon choice -- you all know that -- the decision freely taken by young men and women to join, the decision by more mature men and women to remain. And the institution of the Armed Forces has thrived on its commitment to developing and promoting excellence. It is meritocracy in action. Race, religion, wealth, background count not. Indeed, the military offers many examples for the rest of society, showing what can be done to eradicate the scourge of drugs, to break down the barriers of racial discrimination, to offer equal opportunity to women.
This is not just a result of self-selection. It also reflects the military's commitment to education and training. You know, people speak of defense conversion, the process by which the defense firms retool for civilian tasks. Well, defense conversion within the military has been going on for years. It is the constant process of training and retraining, which the military does so well, that allows individuals to keep up with the latest technology, take on more challenging assignments, and prepare for life on the outside.
Out of this culture of merit and competition have emerged hundreds of thousands of highly skilled men and women brimming with real self-confidence. What they possess is a special mix of discipline, a willingness to accept direction, and the confidence, a willingness to accept responsibility. Together, discipline and confidence provide the basis for winning, for getting the job done.
There is no higher calling, no more honorable choice than the one that you here today have made. To join the Armed Forces is to be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for your country and for your fellow man.
What you have done, what you are doing, sends an important message, one that I fear sometimes gets lost amidst today's often materialist, self-interested culture. It is important to remember, it is important to demonstrate that there is a higher purpose to life beyond one's self. Now, I speak of family, of community, of ideals. I speak of duty, honor, country.
There are many forms of contributing to this country, of public service. Yes, there is government. There is voluntarism. I love to talk about the thousand Points of Light, one American helping another. The daily tasks that require doing in our classrooms, in our hospitals, our cities, our farms, all can and do represent a form of service. In whatever form, service benefits our society, and it ennobles the giver. It is a cherished American concept, one we should continue to practice and pass on to our children.
This was what I wanted to share on this occasion. You are beginning your service to country, and I am nearing the end of mine. Exactly half a century ago, in June of 1942, as General Graves mentioned, we were at war, and I was graduating from school. The speaker that day at Andover was the then-Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. And his message was one of public service, but with a twist -- on the importance of finishing one's schooling before going off to fight for one's country. I listened closely to what he had to say, but I didn't take his advice. And that day was my 18th birthday. And when the commencement ceremony ended, I went on into Boston and enlisted in the Navy as a seaman 2d class. And I never regretted it.
You, too, have signed up. You, too, will never regret it. And I salute you for it. Fortunately, because of the sacrifices made in years before and still being made, you should be able to complete this phase of your education.
A half century has passed since I left school to go into the service. A half century has passed since that day when Stimson spoke of the challenge of creating a new world. You will also be entering a new world, one far better than the one I came to know, a world with the potential to be far better yet. This is the challenge. This is the opportunity of your lifetimes. I envy you for it, and I wish you Godspeed. And while I'm at it, as your Commander in Chief, I hereby grant amnesty to the Corps of Cadets.
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. Good luck to all of you. Warm up here. Good luck to you guys. Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-02-25,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Please. Please. It's an honor to be with you. I have a whole big, beautiful speech to give, but I just gave two of them, and I thought we'd do, maybe, a little question and answer. You've heard it before and -- so we could do that. I just want to say we've had a tremendous time in India.
Prime Minister Modi is a fantastic man doing a fantastic job. He's a real friend of mine. And, you know, you always say that in a guarded way. He's a friend, but he loves India. And I'm a friend, but I love the USA. But he's done an incredible job. And we're working together, I would say, better than our countries have ever worked before.
I know many of the people in the room by name and reputation. Incredible job that you've done. Incredible job that you've done. Really inspirational for not only your country, but really inspirational for anybody looking to be a successful businessperson. And there are plenty of them around. The job that you have all done is incredible.
And we know many of you have invested in the United States, and you have to say, ""Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You've made us even richer.
But that's a very serious thing, but we think we're in very good shape in the United States. We've essentially closed the border to areas where we had to close them. And we had very few. We took in 32 people over the last two days because they were sick and they're Americans, and they're great people.
You know, what are you going to do? They're in quarantine. But we had, essentially, 12 people. Many of them are getting better now. Soon, they'll all be better, we hope. And we're watching very carefully. So we've had a very, very good stretch of -- let's just say we're fortunate so far. And we think it's going to remain that way.
China is working very, very hard. I have spoken to President Xi, and they're working very hard. And if you know anything about him, I think he'll be in pretty good shape. They're -- they've had a rough patch, and I think right now they have it -- it looks like they're getting it under control more and more.
They're getting it more and more under control. So I think that's a problem that's going to go away. But we lost almost 1,000 points yesterday on the market, and that's something. You know, things like that happen where -- and you have it in your business all the time -- it had nothing to do with you; it's an outside source that nobody would have ever predicted.
If you go back six months or three months ago, nobody would have ever predicted. But let's see, I think it's going to be under control. And I think I can speak for our country, for -- our country is under control. But again, we do business with a lot of other countries. We take care -- we work with other countries.
We want other countries to be happy, healthy, and well. They've got to be happy, healthy, and well. It's very simple. And so let's see how it all works out, but I think it's going to work out fine. I hope so. We're working very hard. We're spending a tremendous amount of money also on -- we just asked for two and a half-billion dollars on getting everything ready just in case something should happen, and also helping other nations that really aren't equipped to do it. So with that, it's an honor to be with you.
And if you'd like to ask some questions and find out how much you should invest in the United States of America, I'll tell you exactly where to invest and how to invest. We just did a lot of business with India, where they're buying $3 billion worth of helicopters -- great helicopter. We have helicopters like -- we make the best military equipment in the world, by far.
And, you know, the Prime Minister actually said, ""If you were President 30 years ago, we'd have all your equipment."" But they started buying many years ago from another nation and others. And now they're starting to buy from us. So that's an honor. But we're up to a pretty high number. We'll be up very quickly to a pretty high number.
And we do make, by far, the best. And they want to have the best, so that's what we do. So thank you all very much. If the press wants to stay for a couple of questions -- you know, we're going to be having a news conference at 5 o'clock, so you can go to that, or you could stay and hear some of these questions from -- truly some of the greatest business leaders anywhere in the world.
Now, if you'd like to do -- I could do this, Steve: I could read the book for you and we could have nice, beautiful, little speech. It will take five minutes and you'll be -- you'll fall asleep. And they'll be -- well, they might find it interesting.
But please, if you have any questions, please. Anybody? Okay, let's go home.
Go ahead. Please. And how are we doing?
It sounds nice.
It's going up.
It's going up very, very rapidly. Thank you very much, Dan. Really, a great job. Where is Robert? Yes, please.
Okay. Good. Would anybody like to say? Go ahead. Please.
Yep.
Good.
Great job. Yeah.
So which to you is more important: the tax cuts -- we did massive tax cuts --
-- or the regulation cuts?
Because I've had a lot of people in your positions running the biggest companies in the world saying the tax cuts are very important, but the regulation cuts may have been more important.
Right. We have already [Inaudible] skill 1 million people [Inaudible]. Oh, that's fantastic. Thank you. That's great.
I heard that you were doing that, and I really appreciate it and Ivanka appreciates it. You know, she started it off -- she wanted to get 500,000 people jobs. And if you know her, within about two weeks she had that one done. And I think you're up to over 15 million people being trained by great companies.
Some great companies. Walmart was very much instrumental and some of the companies in this room.
Yeah. They've done a great --
So it's up to 15. And I don't think government can teach jobs like that. In other words, you teach something and it's complex stuff. Government is not equipped to do that. We can put all of the money we want into government to do it, and they're just not equipped to do it. So thank you very much. Thanks fantastic.
Great story. Thank you. Yes, sir.
Right. That's right.
Very good. You've done a great job. So when are the bids due? When are they due?
How many vans is it that you'd be making?
Wow. That's a big business, isn't it?
Right. That's right.
Good. Well, good luck. That's great. That's good luck. Yes, sir. Please.
Right. Healthcare is very important to the Republican Party, I will tell you. And we haven't been talking about it. We've been doing -- we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a disaster in Obamacare, which really ended Obamacare. We're now taking the shell of Obamacare and really running it well.
I had a choice: I could run it well or I could run it poorly. Then everybody would be upset and they'd blame President Obama. We decided to run it well, but would like to terminate it and put in great healthcare. We can do that. When you look at single-payer, when you look at what Bernie Sanders and others want to do for the Democrats, it will never work because they're never going to be able to do it. It's not going to work, number one.
And number two, it's not going to be good even if it did work. And it's totally unaffordable, which for you would be a big problem. And I happen to think -- I've been pretty good at markets. The fact that they are even looking like they're in the hunt, I think drives our stock market down. When we win reelection -- and I think we will -- when we win, I think the market is going to go up like -- it's going to be like a rocket ship.
Like last time, but even more so. I think the fact that the Democrats are so radical, so out of control, they honestly don't know what they're doing. You see what's happening. They want to tell you about healthcare and yet they can't count their votes. In fact, now they're even saying that -- if you look at Nevada, that's all messed up with the vote count, and some of them are questioning the votes, but certainly Iowa was -- I've never seen anything like it and I've been watching politics for a long time.
Been involved in it now for a while. And I've never seen anything like it. So -- but I think the fact that there -- you know, there's an election coming up. I think, you know, a lot of people think we're going to win the election. I feel we're going to win the election because what we've done for jobs and for the military, for the vets, what we've done for healthcare, what we've done for healthcare is incredible, including giving options to Obamacare at a far less cost.
A cost that's much less. But if you look at all of the things that we've done -- rebuilding our military, the biggest tax cuts in history, regulation cuts -- that brought all of you people; that's why you're in the United States. And then you're very happy and you're going in with more. But I think until the election is over, people are -- and it's not just Bernie Sanders.
It's others, too. I think if people thought that there was a real chance of them getting it, it really is going to keep the market down. Now, the market has been up 70, 80, 90 percent depending on your definition of -- you can look at about 16 different definitions. But the country has been incredible. It had one bad day; that was yesterday.
Futures are up today a little bit. But if you look at what we've done in terms of the percentage, even taking 1,000 points off, the numbers are incredible. If the other side had gotten in, I think it would've been 50 or 60 points down from where it was, because the big thing again -- these regulation cuts -- they were going put more regulations on. You couldn't -- you were being strangled.
Whether it was Keystone Pipeline, Dakota Access Pipeline, 48,000 jobs between the two of them. So many other things. I mean, nothing was getting done. Nothing was going to be built. It would take you 20 years to get a highway approved. A small highway. It'd take you 20 years to get a roadway approved. And it was out of control.
We have that way down. That number is way, way down. And they may not get approved, because if it doesn't work from a safety standpoint or an environmental standpoint, we don't want to get it approved either. We're not going to let them have it approved. But it's going to end up taking two years, and we're trying to get it down to less than that.
And if it doesn't work, at least you're going to find -- and how about working on something for 21 years, and you find out that it just got rejected? So, half of your working life -- of course, nowadays with people retiring so early, it's more than half, right? But half of your working life, you're trying to get an approval.
And then after 20 or 21 years, they reject you. We reject -- three to two. That happens. It happens. So we've done a real job. But I think that, frankly, until the election is over, our market -- it's phenomenal, but our market will jump thousands and thousands of points, if I win. If I don't win, you're going to see a crash like you've never seen before.
. Okay. Anybody else? Yes, sir. Please.
Great.
I actually follow you guys, you know -- what you're investing.
Yeah.
Right.
That's right. That was one of the things I said. Right? I put a little note, in handwriting: You have to make the pipe in the USA. Right? On the bottom. They said, ""Sir, this will take two weeks to get."" I said, ""No, it doesn't."" You have to. Now, we had a little problem because they already bought the pipe, right?
And that was a little bit, you know, unfair to them, I thought. So we had to sort of let them do what they had to do. But they had bought much of the pipe. And Dakota Access pipeline was already built, except for the one river area that I freed up for them. So it was great. Well, that's good. So, is that what you do?
Thank you very much. That's very nice to say. I appreciate. Thank you for the investment. Yes, sir. Please.
Right. I know that. Yeah.
Well, we are. Now, some of the regulations have to go through what they call a ""statutory process,"" where you started to cut -- we have the Secretary of Commerce here, and Wilbur knows exactly what this is all about. You have a statutory process. So we're going to cut regulations, but we have to give a 90-day notice.
Then we have to give 120 days. Then we have to give 30 days. And we're in that process now, with respect to a lot. No, we're going to cut a lot more regulations. No -- no -- and we're going to also have regulations because I think you need regulation for safety and for environmental. But no President has ever cut anywhere close to what we've done.
And I've done it in three years, and some of them have been for eight. In one case, it's more than eight. But no President has come close. But we are in statutory environments where we have to go -- we have one where we have to wait six months before we do phase two, which is -- and there's four or five phases, but they're all in a pipeline to get cut.
And there's a certain period in about seven or eight months from now where a lot of them are going to be gone. But we go through the process. But you've seen a big difference.
Yeah. Good. Thank you very much. Yeah. It'll only get better, too. Yes, sir. Please.
Good.
Yeah. Big one. Yeah.
Seven billion. Big one.
Right, sure.
Right, exactly.
Right. You're doing 4G. Are you going to do 5G too?
Huawei.
Well, that's good. Good. Put a bid in.
They followed us.
Right. Right. They're getting approved a lot quicker.
Well, it will be as long as I'm here. But if the wrong person gets elected, that won't happen at all. And a lot of bad things will happen. And that has -- you know, it is holding back. There's no question about it. I mean, I think we're favored to win.
Somebody said 65 percent. But 65 percent means there's 35 percent of something that people don't want. And it would be devastating because the economy has never been as good as it is right now. It's being held back by the fact that we have an election coming up. And I don't think there's anybody, frankly, on this side -- on the other side that's going to be very inspirational.
It certainly doesn't look like it. So we'll see what happens. Thank you.
Yeah. Great job you've done. Yeah. Fantastic. Yes, sir. Please.
How much?
Seventy what?
Good. It's nice when you can say that's a small company. Right?
It's a great state. Those people are incredible.
They'll get that done. So you're dealing with the governor -- the governor? He's a great governor, actually.
Good. He'll get it done. Good. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Yes, sir. Please.
Mostly aluminum? Mostly aluminum?
How is that going? How's it all going?
We helped you a lot -- right? -- with the tariffs.
Good.
You got it very quickly. If I weren't elected, the aluminum business in the United States would be absolutely dead and the steel business would be dead too, frankly. What we did. You know, they were dumping steel all over the place and bad things were happening. And it wasn't good dumping either. It was real -- it was sand steel; it was garbage.
And we got that straightened out. So, good. But the aluminum business has made a big comeback. That's good. That's good.
So your total investment was 12, did you say?
How much? $12 billion? That's a big investment. That's a big investment.
That's good. That's good.
It's big.
And it means jobs. And we just signed the deal with China, and they're going to be spending $250 billion a year now on our country. Fifty billion will go -- forty to fifty will go to the farmers for the purchase of farm product. But China has been -- you know, great. It's going to be a great deal. We're very happy with it. They're going to take care of their other problem, I hope, quickly.
But we're going to be -- it's going to be an amazing deal. Okay? Thank you. Great job. Yes, sir.
Good.
Well, thank you. Great job. I know your company. Great job. And, you know, we now also have it so money can come in. When your money is offshore, you can bring it in. Before, it was impossible, virtually -- both bureaucratically and the rate was so high that nobody would pay it. So nothing came in. Now we have billions and billions of dollars.
Apple is bringing in $350 billion and they're building plants. I just left one -- they just opened one in Texas; I just left it. And they're building another one, and a lot of things are happening. Great things. Thank you very much. Please.
Thank you.
Yes.
Great. Great job. I know what you've done. Great job. Thank you. So I want to thank you. Go ahead. Let's go. I was just going to say, ""Get out of here,"" but everyone wants a question now, huh? There's a young -- young, brilliant businessman. Go ahead.
Good.
Sure.
That's fantastic.
Is that where you invest? Those areas? That's where you put --
So, how many hotels do you have right now, then?
That's fantastic. That's --
That is really great. I actually know of your company. Not just a small company, by the way. Good job. Thank you very much. Please.
Yes, okay. Well, we'll do one and one, okay? Go ahead.
This one is a big one, right? This is a big -- this is a big guy. This is a big player. Go ahead. I know him very well. I've seen him on enough covers. I should know him, huh? Go ahead. How's it going?
Yeah.
As you know, three years ago, it was just the opposite. It was one of the worst countries to do business in. You couldn't get approvals. You couldn't get anything done. You were sued on environmental -- you know, for environmental reasons, not because of the environment, just because it was a way of stopping a project that would produce jobs.
And I'm a big believer in the environment and I want to take care of the environment, but they were just using the laws. And we don't let that happen anymore. But if it's something that is wrong -- you know better than anybody -- we stop them from doing it. But you've done an incredible job. And the steel industry was dead in our country.
And, you know, we need -- there are certain industries you can do without, to be honest with you. There are certain industry -- we can name a lot of them. But, steel you need, from a military -- and aluminum you need. You got to have the aluminum. But steel you need probably more than anything else. You have to have it. And the job you've done is incredible.
Biggest in the world by far. The job you've done is incredible.
Good. That's a great place.
Good. Well, you let me know. I'll be there for the groundbreaking. No, that's a great -- I know you're investing. I know you're looking at Alabama, right?
I know. I had heard that. That's great for a very -- that's a big plant and that's going to be this super-efficient, super-modern. That's going to be a showcase, I hear.
Right. No, but people know about -- people know about that. That's a great -- that's a great thing for Alabama and it's an incredible place to invest.
Well, you know, we are doing things. One of the things we're doing, we're going to be announcing another tax cut in not so long a period of time, largely for middle-income people, because, you know, we gave them a good tax cut but we're going to give them a fairly substantial cut. And that gives a lot of money to the consumer.
One of the reasons we're doing well, and other countries are not doing well -- China is having a hard time. They're all really -- not too many are doing well. We're doing better than anybody in the world by far. It's because our consumer is rich now because of what we've done with a lot of things: jobs, but also tax cuts.
They have money, and other consumers don't have money. So that's great. That's really -- it's an honor to meet you again. And it was good seeing you there, and I look forward to seeing that plant go up. But I think you're going probably be doing numerous plants in the United States.
Right.
Right.
Right.
You gave them -- you gave them the bonus? You gave them a piece of the cut? And the rest went into investment?
No, it's a great thing. Thank you very much. That's beautiful. Thank you. Okay, final question. Go ahead.
Good.
Yeah.
Good.
Yeah, there is.
Well, as you know, they were targeted as -- and I'm not blaming China for that, because they want to try and win something. And they were targeted, and I made up the difference, as you know, with the tariffs that came from China. So they got targeted from China, and then I took money from China, I gave it to the farmers.
And frankly, they didn't want it. They just want a level playing field. They're incredible people. But they did well, but now they're really doing well, because you're seeing the numbers coming out, and it's -- it's going to be something very special. Not only that -- we have $40 billion coming in from Japan.
We have a tremendous amount coming in from the new trade deal that we made with South Korea. And then Canada and Mexico are going to be -- you know, the deal is fantastic for our farmers.
This is -- you know, this is -- that's right. I mean, that's right, in the truer sense.
And you have a good new head of the World Bank too.
He's doing -- he's one of our people.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure. Well, that -- that, definitely. I thought you said the ""World Bank."" That's right. Congratulations on your success. We hope you come to the United States; invest more billions. Because I view it not as billions, I view it as jobs.
And we have great people and we have the greatest country in the world, in my book. And, by the way, India -- this has been an honor to be here. And you have a very special Prime Minister. You have somebody who is very special and he really knows what he's doing. Somebody said, ""He's such a nice man."" I said, ""Well, actually, he's a very tough man."" But he is a nice man.
He can be, but he can also be as tough as they come. You know what that means. But he's done a fantastic job. But we work very closely together, and we create jobs here and he creates jobs over there through yourselves. So again, anything we can do, let us know. Congratulations on your success. And I'm going to say hello to all the people now that work at the embassy, and then we're going to have a little news conference, unless you guys don't want to do it. Maybe you don't have to do it. Last time, you know, I did it where I met many, many prime ministers, presidents, all -- like for three days.
I said, ""Well, let's cancel the news conference because I saw these guys every 45 minutes."" And when I canceled the news conference, all hell broke out. So we're not going to do that. So, 5 o'clock. We'll see you at 5 o'clock, okay? Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Business Roundtable at the U.S. Embassy in India,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-business-roundtable-new-delhi-february-25-2020
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-03-29,"Hello, everybody. We’ve had a tremendous success right here, and -- come on over, folks. Please. Brian, come on over. We’ve had a tremendous construction success in Florida. This is Lake Okeechobee, which I’ve known for a long time. Lake Okeechobee. It’s an incredible lake, but it’s had a lot of problems and it wasn’t properly funded for years.
I want to introduce some of the folks here. We all know Governor DeSantis and Mrs. DeSantis. Thank you very much for being here. You’ve done a fantastic job. And Ron took over from a governor that a couple of you know -- Rick Scott -- who's been bugging me about getting this done for a long time. And no sooner did Rick go to the Senate that Ron started bugging me the same way and we got it done.
We have the funding and we’re doing. I want to just thank the Army Corps of Engineers, who's been fantastic. I said, “Let’s go. We need a wall also on the border.” You know that, right? I’m looking at all these walls; I’m saying, “Southern border, too. Don’t forget our southern border.” And we’re right now building a lot of wall in the southern border.
I want to thank Senator Marco Rubio, who's been very involved in this. Marco, thank you very much. It’s great. Been very, very involved in it and very important. Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart.
Where are you, Mario? Fantastic job, my friend.
Thank you very much. Brian Mast.
Congressman Brian Mast. Brian, fantastic job.
Fantastic job. We’re proud of you, Brian. Francis Rooney. Where is Francis?
What a job -- what a job you do. You know so much about it. And a young, new congressman who has done really well, Greg Steube. Where are you, Greg? Come. Greg Steube. So I just want to thank everybody for being here. We have something that's very important. It’s important in terms of safety. Our Secretary, as you know, David Bernhardt, is with us. He’s been really doing something very special for Interior.
Everybody respects him. Everybody likes him. He’s right now up, so I hope you guys can help him get his approvals, if you don’t mind. Okay? But he’s Acting, but soon he’ll be, hopefully, permanent. He’s going through a process, and I hear David is doing very well. And maybe I think it might be appropriate if I start with the Governor.
We’ll have -- everybody can say a few words about what we’re doing. But what we’re doing is very, very important. It was very dangerous and it’s a big project. But it’s a great project for Florida. And Florida is a state that's a phenomenal state. A very important project. So if I could ask our Governor to start, and then we’ll go around the horn.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. And I will say -- and I think I have to say, because it’s really to the credit of all of us together: This project was dying until we got involved. This was really dying. And, you know, in 1928, over 5,000 people died here. Everything broke and they had a problem. And the Corps was just explaining -- in 1928, they had a problem that turned out to be a total catastrophe.
And we’re making it stronger than it would ever have been. And it’s really in great shape. So, Marco, do you want to say a few words?
We have a chance to go down as many things. Rick?
I will be. Absolutely. David, could you say a few words, please?
You're doing great. Thank you. Thank you very much, on behalf of a lot of people. Congressman, would you like to say a couple of words?
Thank you. Appreciate it. My honor. Brian?
Well, thank you very much, Brian. Appreciate it. Great job you're doing. Francis?
In a lot of ways -- really, a lot of other locations too. We're doing a lot. Thank you very much, Francis. Congressman?
Thank you very much. And, you know, despite all of that, I saw the General, and I said, ""General, tell me about this in a minute. How are we doing on the southern border?"" And here he is, anyway. Come on, General. Say a few words about this place.
Thank you very much. You're doing a great job. Okay, folks, thank you very much.
It could be to all trade. Mexico is making absolutely a fortune with the United States. They have a trade surplus of over $100 billion, which is far bigger than anybody understands. They've had it for many years. And either they're going to stop -- they have the strongest immigration laws anywhere in the world.
And we have the weakest, the most pathetic laws. Number one, Congress has to act. And number two, Mexico -- they make so much money from the United States and so many other things, so many other assets, they have to grab it and they have to stop it. We have, right now, two big caravans coming up from Guatemala.
Massive caravans walking right through Mexico. So, Mexico is tough. They can stop them, but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them. And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. They'll close it. And we'll keep it closed for a long time. I'm not playing games. Mexico has to stop it. They have people coming right through Mexico.
It's a long, very dangerous journey. Mexico sends busses, they send trucks, they do absolutely -- they started, at one point, a little bit -- stopping. They don’t do anything to stop it right now. So the caravan has formed. I've ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras, and to El Salvador. No money goes there anymore.
We were giving them $500 million. We were giving them tremendous aid. We stopped payment to Honduras, to Guatemala, and to El Salvador. We were paying them tremendous amounts of money, and we're not paying them anymore because they haven't done a thing for us. They set up these caravans. In many cases, they put their worst people in the caravan; they're not going to put their best in. They get rid of their problems.
And they march up here, and then they're coming into their country; we're not letting them in our country. Our Border Patrol, the job they've done, is incredible. The job that ICE is doing is incredible. And we have run out of space. We can't hold people anymore. And Mexico can stop it so easily. They don't go through a court system every time somebody steps on our land.
You step on our land: ""Welcome to the United States."" It's ridiculous. So Congress -- and I know you guys are going to work hard on it -- but Congress has to fix our broken immigration laws. We're the laughing stock all over the world. People pour into this country and we stop them because Border Patrol is so incredible.
But there's a point at which you can't stop them anymore. We have no detention space, no nothing. So, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador have done nothing. Mexico has done nothing. And I'll tell you something: Colombia -- you have your new President of Colombia. Really good guy. I've met him. We had him at the White House.
He said how he's going to stop drugs. More drugs are coming out of Colombia right now than before he was President. So he has done nothing for us. Okay. Thank you very much.
It's in the Supreme Court right now. After the Supreme Court.
She's great. We're going to have a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, I think at 4 o'clock, about Linda.
We're going to be doing more. We're going to be doing more.
Soon. A lot. More than you would ever believe.
Healthcare is going well. Healthcare is going well. We are going to have a plan that's so much better than Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster. We're going to have a plan that is so much better than Obamacare. So the healthcare is going very well. And we're going to take care of -- we're going to always take care of preexisting conditions.
Just remember that. Always preexisting conditions. But Obamacare is too costly for people. They can't afford it. And the deductible, which averages more than $7,000, meaning, unless somebody has got really big problems, can't even use it. Obamacare is a disaster. Right now it's losing in court. Right now, in the Texas court, as you know, probably ends up in the Supreme Court.
But we're plan- -- we're doing something that is going to be much less expensive than Obamacare for the people. I'm not saying government; I'm saying for the people. And we're going to have preexisting conditions, and we'll have a much lower deductible. So -- and I've been saying it: The Republicans are going to end up being the party of healthcare. Thank you very much.
","Remarks: Donald Trump Visits Herbert Hoover Dike in Pahokee, Florida",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-herbert-hoover-dike-florida-march-29-2019
Barack Obama,United States of America,2010-04-15,"Thank you.
I want to thank Senator Bill Nelson and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden for their extraordinary leadership. I want to recognize Dr. Buzz Aldrin as well, who’s in the house. Four decades ago, Buzz became a legend. But in the four decades since he’s also been one of America’s leading visionaries and authorities on human space flight.
Few people -- present company excluded -- can claim the expertise of Buzz and Bill and Charlie when it comes to space exploration. I have to say that few people are as singularly unimpressed by Air Force One as those three. Sure, it’s comfortable, but it can’t even reach low Earth orbit. And that obviously is in striking contrast to the Falcon 9 rocket we just saw on the launch pad, which will be tested for the very first time in the coming weeks.
A couple of other acknowledgments I want to make. We’ve got Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee from Texas visiting us, a big supporter of the space program.My director, Office of Science and Technology Policy -- in other words my chief science advisor -- John Holdren is here.And most of all I want to acknowledge your congresswoman Suzanne Kosmas, because every time I meet with her, including the flight down here, she reminds me of how important our NASA programs are and how important this facility is. And she is fighting for every single one of you and for her district and for the jobs in her district. And you should know that you’ve got a great champion in Congresswoman Kosmas. Please give her a big round of applause.
I also want to thank everybody for participating in today’s conference. And gathered here are scientists, engineers, business leaders, public servants, and a few more astronauts as well. Last but not least, I want to thank the men and women of NASA for welcoming me to the Kennedy Space Center, and for your contributions not only to America, but to the world.
Here at the Kennedy Space Center we are surrounded by monuments and milestones of those contributions. It was from here that NASA launched the missions of Mercury and Gemini and Apollo. It was from here that Space Shuttle Discovery, piloted by Charlie Bolden, carried the Hubble Telescope into orbit, allowing us to plumb the deepest recesses of our galaxy. And I should point out, by the way, that in my private office just off the Oval, I’ve got the picture of Jupiter from the Hubble. So thank you, Charlie, for helping to decorate my office. It was from here that men and women, propelled by sheer nerve and talent, set about pushing the boundaries of humanity’s reach.
That’s the story of NASA. And it’s a story that started a little more than half a century ago, far from the Space Coast, in a remote and desolate region of what is now called Kazakhstan. Because it was from there that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth, which was little more than a few pieces of metal with a transmitter and a battery strapped to the top of a missile. But the world was stunned. Americans were dumbfounded. The Soviets, it was perceived, had taken the lead in a race for which we were not yet fully prepared.
But we caught up very quick. President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and to invest in science and math education, from grade school to graduate school. In 1961, President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of Congress that the United States would send a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth within the decade. And as a nation, we set about meeting that goal, reaping rewards that have in the decades since touched every facet of our lives. NASA was at the forefront. Many gave their careers to the effort. And some have given far more.
In the years that have followed, the space race inspired a generation of scientists and innovators, including, I’m sure, many of you. It’s contributed to immeasurable technological advances that have improved our health and well-being, from satellite navigation to water purification, from aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging. Although, I have to say, during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said, you know, it’s more than just Tang -- and I had to point out I actually really like Tang.I thought that was very cool.
And leading the world to space helped America achieve new heights of prosperity here on Earth, while demonstrating the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity of its people.
And on a personal note, I have been part of that generation so inspired by the space program. 1961 was the year of my birth -- the year that Kennedy made his announcement. And one of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather’s shoulders, waving a flag as astronauts arrived in Hawaii. For me, the space program has always captured an essential part of what it means to be an American -- reaching for new heights, stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible. And so, as President, I believe that space exploration is not a luxury, it’s not an afterthought in America’s quest for a brighter future -- it is an essential part of that quest.
So today, I’d like to talk about the next chapter in this story. The challenges facing our space program are different, and our imperatives for this program are different, than in decades past. We’re no longer racing against an adversary. We’re no longer competing to achieve a singular goal like reaching the Moon. In fact, what was once a global competition has long since become a global collaboration. But while the measure of our achievements has changed a great deal over the past 50 years, what we do -- or fail to do -- in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential for our future in space and here on Earth.
I know there have been a number of questions raised about my administration’s plan for space exploration, especially in this part of Florida where so many rely on NASA as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community. And these questions come at a time of transition, as the space shuttle nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years of service. And understandably, this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only about their own futures but about the future of the space program to which they’ve devoted their lives.
But I also know that underlying these concerns is a deeper worry, one that precedes not only this plan but this administration. It stems from the sense that people in Washington -- driven sometimes less by vision than by politics -- have for years neglected NASA’s mission and undermined the work of the professionals who fulfill it. We’ve seen that in the NASA budget, which has risen and fallen with the political winds.
All that has to change. And with the strategy I’m outlining today, it will. We start by increasing NASA’s budget by $6 billion over the next five years, even -- I want people to understand the context of this. This is happening even as we have instituted a freeze on discretionary spending and sought to make cuts elsewhere in the budget.
So NASA, from the start, several months ago when I issued my budget, was one of the areas where we didn’t just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by $6 billion. By doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system, including a probe of the Sun’s atmosphere; new scouting missions to Mars and other destinations; and an advanced telescope to follow Hubble, allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before.
We will increase Earth-based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world -- science that will garner tangible benefits, helping us to protect our environment for future generations.
Now, I recognize that some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way. I disagree. The truth is, NASA has always relied on private industry to help design and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to space, from the Mercury capsule that carried John Glenn into orbit nearly 50 years ago, to the space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting overhead. By buying the services of space transportation -- rather than the vehicles themselves -- we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met. But we will also accelerate the pace of innovations as companies -- from young startups to established leaders -- compete to design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials out of our atmosphere.
In addition, as part of this effort, we will build on the good work already done on the Orion crew capsule. I’ve directed Charlie Bolden to immediately begin developing a rescue vehicle using this technology, so we are not forced to rely on foreign providers if it becomes necessary to quickly bring our people home from the International Space Station. And this Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions. In fact, Orion will be readied for flight right here in this room.
At the same time, after decades of neglect, we will increase investment -- right away -- in other groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach space sooner and more often, to travel farther and faster for less cost, and to live and work in space for longer periods of time more safely. That means tackling major scientific and technological challenges. How do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions? How do we harness resources on distant worlds? How do we supply spacecraft with energy needed for these far-reaching journeys? These are questions that we can answer and will answer. And these are the questions whose answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on Earth.
So the point is what we’re looking for is not just to continue on the same path -- we want to leap into the future; we want major breakthroughs; a transformative agenda for NASA.
Now, yes, pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy. In part, this is because the old strategy -- including the Constellation program -- was not fulfilling its promise in many ways. That’s not just my assessment; that’s also the assessment of a panel of respected non-partisan experts charged with looking at these issues closely. Now, despite this, some have had harsh words for the decisions we’ve made, including some individuals who I’ve got enormous respect and admiration for.
But what I hope is, is that everybody will take a look at what we are planning, consider the details of what we’ve laid out, and see the merits as I’ve described them. The bottom line is nobody is more committed to manned space flight, to human exploration of space than I am. But we’ve got to do it in a smart way, and we can’t just keep on doing the same old things that we’ve been doing and thinking that somehow is going to get us to where we want to go.
Some have said, for instance, that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing to produce plans within NASA to reach low Earth orbit, instead of relying on companies and other countries. But we will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan, in ways that will help us improve our technological capacity and lower our costs, which are both essential for the long-term sustainability of space flight. In fact, through our plan, we’ll be sending many more astronauts to space over the next decade.
. But it’s precisely by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative companies that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our capabilities -- even as we build on the important work already completed, through projects like Orion, for future missions. And unlike the previous program, we are setting a course with specific and achievable milestones.
Early in the next decade, a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for exploration beyond low Earth orbit.And by 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space.So we’ll start -- we’ll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history. By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth. And a landing on Mars will follow. And I expect to be around to see it.
Finally, I want to say a few words about jobs. Suzanne pointed out to me that the last time I was here, I made a very clear promise that I would help in the transition into a new program to make sure that people who are already going through a tough time here in this region were helped. And despite some reports to the contrary, my plan will add more than 2,500 jobs along the Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the previous administration. So I want to make that point.
We’re going to modernize the Kennedy Space Center, creating jobs as we upgrade launch facilities. And there’s potential for even more jobs as companies in Florida and across America compete to be part of a new space transportation industry. And some of those industry leaders are here today. This holds the promise of generating more than 10,000 jobs nationwide over the next few years. And many of these jobs will be created right here in Florida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition.
Now, it’s true -- there are Floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program winds down. This is based on a decision that was made six years ago, not six months ago, but that doesn’t make it any less painful for families and communities affected as this decision becomes reality.
So I’m proposing -- in part because of strong lobbying by Bill and by Suzanne, as well as Charlie -- I’m proposing a $40 million initiative led by a high-level team from the White House, NASA, and other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation. And I expect this plan to reach my desk by August 15th.It’s an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond.
So this is the next chapter that we can write together here at NASA. We will partner with industry. We will invest in cutting-edge research and technology. We will set far-reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones. And step by step, we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do.
Fifty years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite. And in fulfilling this task, we will not only extend humanity’s reach in space -- we will strengthen America’s leadership here on Earth.
Now, little more than 40 years ago, astronauts descended the nine-rung ladder of the lunar module called Eagle, and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the Earth’s only Moon. This was the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit -- of an endeavor that pushed the boundaries of our knowledge, of our technological prowess, of our very capacity as human beings to solve problems. It wasn’t just the greatest achievement in NASA’s history -- it was one of the greatest achievements in human history.
And the question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something or the end of something. I choose to believe it was only the beginning.
So thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.
Thank you.
",Speech on Space Exploration in the 21st Century,https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamanasaboldcourse.htm
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-10-25,"Well, I think it's very sad what they've done with this fake dossier. It was made up, and I understand they paid a tremendous amount of money, and Hillary Clinton always denied it.
The Democrats always denied it. And now only because it's going to come out in a court case, they said, yes, they did it. They admitted it, and they're embarrassed by it.
But I think it's a disgrace. It's just really -- it's a very sad -- it's a very sad commentary on politics in this country.
I don't think so. I think it's fine the way it is. We have actually great unity in the Republican Party. Yesterday, I was --
That's okay. Look, you know they have to do their thing. We have great unity. If you look at what happened yesterday at the meeting, we had, I guess, virtually every senator, including John McCain. We had a great conversation yesterday -- John McCain and myself -- about the military.
I think we had a -- I called it a lovefest. It was almost a lovefest. Maybe it was a lovefest. But we -- standing ovations. There is great unity. If you look at the Democrats with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, that's a mess. There's great unity in the Republican Party.
Well, I think it's sad. But I think to a large extent, in all due respect, I think the media causes a lot of it. Fake stories are being reported. A lot of bad things are being reported that aren't true, and I think to a certain extent, maybe I can blame the media.
But politics is a rough business. There's no question about it. I will say this: I think the Republican Party has a pretty good unity. When I looked at that room yesterday at lunch -- and you know, and you reported on it very well, Kristen. You gave it a very good report. The fact is there was tremendous unity in that room, and we're really unified. We're really unified on what we want to do.
We want tax cuts for the middle class. We want tax cuts for businesses to produce jobs. There's great unity. Yes.
Look, he was against me from before he ever knew me. He wrote a book about me before I ever met him, before I ever heard his name. His poll numbers in Arizona are so low that he couldn't win, and I don't blame him for leaving. I think he did the right thing for himself.
But if you know, long before he ever knew me, during the campaign, even before the campaign -- I mean, he came out with this horrible book, and I said, who is this guy?
In fact, I remembered the first time I saw him on television I had not really been -- nobody knew me in terms of politics. But the first time I saw him on television, I said, I assume he's a Democrat. Is he a Democrat? They said he's a Republican. I said, that's impossible.
So, look, his poll numbers are terrible. He's done terribly for the great people of Arizona, a state that likes Donald Trump very much as even you will admit. And he would have never won.
In fact, even in the primary, he's way down in the primary. So he did the smart thing for himself. This way he can get out somewhat gracefully. But --
Well, he's saying that -- he's saying that because he has nothing else to say. But I do think this -- I do think this: I wish him well. I really believe he's going to do the right thing for the country.
He's going to vote for tax cuts because we desperately need tax cuts to put our people back to work. We need tax cuts also to be able to compete with other countries.
You know what, I hope Bob -- and I really believe that Bob Corker is going to do the right thing also. Yes, go ahead.
I can't hear you. I can't -- what? Say it again.
Well, Senator Flake did vote with me. I understand it was about 91 or even more than that. So from that standpoint, good.
No, I think I'll be boosted in Arizona because he's very unpopular. I think the fact that he did it the way he did it probably -- I mean, I'm very high in Arizona. I love the people; they like me. They like security at the border. You know, all of the things. But I think I'm probably helped greatly in Arizona by what happened with Senator Flake.
I don't think they'd do that. I really know that they want tax cuts. They know we need it. We need it for the country, we need it for the people, we need if for the middle class, we need it for jobs. I don't think they'd do that. I really don't.
I know them well enough. I don't know Flake very well, but I know Bob Corker. I think they really would do it. I think they feel they have to do it for the country.
Say it?
I think we're going to get some Democrat votes, yeah. I do believe -- I haven't started the process, but I believe that there are certain Democrats that, if they don't vote for these massive tax cuts for business, for jobs, and for the middle class, they will lose their races in '18.
Well, I think the press makes me more uncivil than I am. You know, people don't understand -- I went to an Ivy League college, I was a nice student, I did very well, I'm a very intelligent person. The fact is, I think -- I really believe -- I think the press creates a different image of Donald Trump than the real person.
Well, I think it's always okay -- when somebody says something about you that's false, I think it's always okay to counterpunch or to fight back. John.
I wanted to end that quickly. And they're important because that's one of the great benefits to the middle class. I didn't want that to go too far. That's why I ended it very quickly.
Well, maybe it is, and maybe we'll use it as negotiating. But trust me, that's one of the great things. You know, there are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.
Well, I think the uranium sale to Russia and the way it was done, so underhanded, with tremendous amounts of money being passed -- I actually think that's Watergate, modern age.
Say it again, please.
I can't --
Well, we're going to look at it. Now, I have to say, we are decimating ISIS in the Middle East. What's happening is, they'll go to parts of Africa, they'll go to other places. When they get there, we meet them. It's a dangerous business -- I have to say, it's a dangerous business. So what --
No, I didn't. Not specifically. But I have generals that are great generals. These are great fighters. These are warriors and --
I gave them authority to do what's right so that we win. That's the authority they have. I want to win and we're going to win, and we're beating ISIS very badly. You look at what's happened in the Middle East -- we have done more in eight months than the previous administration has done in many years.
Now, what happens is, you decimate them and that's all we've done. We have decimated ISIS in the Middle East. They go to Africa, they go to places. When they get there, we meet them there. That's what goes on. It's a tough business. It's a tough war, but we are winning it. And you know what? We're going to continue winning it.
With that being said, my generals and my military, they have decision-making ability. As far as the incident that we're talking about, I've been seeing it just like you've been seeing it. I've been getting reports. They have to meet the enemy and they meet them tough, and that's what happens.
I was extremely nice to her. She sounds like a lovely lady. I've never seen her. I've never met her, but she sounds likes a lovely lady. But I was extremely nice to her. I was extremely courteous, as I was to everyone else.
You know, it's interesting, you folks have called many people that I spoke to. Everybody has said unbelievable, good thing about me, but you never report that.
Did you report it? Did you report it?
Thank you.
I can only say this: I was really nice to her. I respect her. I respect her family. I certainly respect La David, who -- I, by the way, called La David right from the beginning. Just so you understand, they put a chart in front -- ""La David."""" It says
So I called right from the beginning. There's no hesitation. One of the great memories of all time. There was no hesitation. I think she's a fantastic woman. I was extremely nice to her, extremely respectful.
I would say, basically, we talked condolence. I mean, it's all about condolence, it's about warmth. In many cases you listen, because in so many cases -- one of the families, they were saying, yes, he was a great football star.
And honestly, they pour their heart out, John. It's the hardest calls. They pour their heart out. But I am always -- and look, you people have called many people that I've spoken to, and every one of them has said I couldn't have been nicer.
Now, it's a rough time for these people. I mean, how tough is it? There's nothing tougher. But I have such respect for those families. Nobody has more respect than I do -- nobody.
We're looking at DACA. We have to get something for it, but we are looking at DACA. And we'll see what happens. I would love to do a DACA deal, but we have to get something very substantial for it, including the wall, including security, including a strong border. We have to be able to stop drugs from pouring into our nation.
The tax plan is going to be incredible for this country. It's going to bring back jobs, it's going to cut taxes tremendously. We're going to bring back $4 trillion, I think at least from overseas.
That money is going to be put back to work in our country instead of other countries. The tax cut is going to be massive. It's going to keep companies from leaving our country. So important.
Not that I know of, no.
And I have to say, the whole Russian thing is what it's turned out to be. This was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing an election. It's an election that's very hard for a Democrat to lose because the Electoral College is set in such a way that it's very hard to lose that election for a Democrat. They lost it. They lost it very badly and very easily.
I mean, you look at the votes; it was 306 to what -- 223 or something. They lost it by a lot. They didn't know what to say, so they made up the whole Russia hoax. Now it's turning out that the hoax has turned around. And you look at what's happened with Russia, and you look at the uranium deal, and you look at the fake dossier. So that's all turned around.
No, not at all.
No. We have a very good relationship. Honestly, when you look at -- when you take a look at what's happened with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and the hatred and the division and the animosity -- I'll tell you what, honestly, the Republicans are very, very well united.
We're going to have a big meeting on opioids tomorrow. We're going to be doing a very, very important meeting sometime in the very short -- the very near future on opioids, in terms of declaring a national emergency, which gives us power to do things that you can't do right now.
Well, they say it began with the Republicans. I think I would know, but I won't say. It'll be determined. It'll be determined.
Look, Hillary would have never announced it was them, except for this great court case that's going on where the judge was going to reveal it. So they figured, we'll do it first. They're very embarrassed by it. It's a disgrace. Yes, it might have started with the Republicans early on in the primaries. I think I would know, but let's find out who it is. I'm sure that will come out.
I think I would have, if I were to guess, I have one name in mind.
It will probably be revealed.
Well, I'd rather not say but you'll be surprised.

Assalamualaikum dan salam sejahtera. Thank you to the people of Jakarta and thank you to the people of Indonesia.
Pulang kampung nih. I am so glad that I made it back to Indonesia and that Michelle was able to join me. We had a couple of false starts this year, but I was determined to visit a country that’s meant so much to me. And unfortunately, this visit is too short, but I look forward to coming back a year from now when Indonesia hosts the East Asia Summit.
Before I go any further, I want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with all of those Indonesians who are affected by the recent tsunami and the volcanic eruptions -- particularly those who’ve lost loved ones, and those who’ve been displaced. And I want you all to know that as always, the United States stands with Indonesia in responding to natural disasters, and we are pleased to be able to help as needed. As neighbors help neighbors and families take in the displaced, I know that the strength and the resilience of the Indonesian people will pull you through once more.
America has a stake in an Indonesia that plays its rightful role in shaping the global economy. Gone are the days when seven or eight countries would come together to determine the direction of global markets. That’s why the G20 is now the center of international economic cooperation, so that emerging economies like Indonesia have a greater voice and also bear greater responsibility for guiding the global economy. And through its leadership of the G20’s anti-corruption group, Indonesia should lead on the world stage and by example in embracing transparency and accountability.America has a stake in an Indonesia that pursues sustainable development, because the way we grow will determine the quality of our lives and the health of our planet. And that’s why we’re developing clean energy technologies that can power industry and preserve Indonesia’s precious natural resources -- and America welcomes your country’s strong leadership in the global effort to combat climate change.Above all, America has a stake in the success of the Indonesian people. Underneath the headlines of the day, we must build bridges between our people, because our future security and prosperity is shared. And that is exactly what we’re doing -- by increasing collaboration among our scientists and researchers, and by working together to foster entrepreneurship. And I’m especially pleased that we have committed to double the number of American and Indonesian students studying in our respective countries. We want more Indonesian students in American schools, and we want more American students to come study in this country. We want to forge new ties and greater understanding between young people in this young century.These are the issues that really matter in our daily lives. Development, after all, is not simply about growth rates and numbers on a balance sheet. It’s about whether a child can learn the skills they need to make it in a changing world. It’s about whether a good idea is allowed to grow into a business, and not suffocated by corruption. It’s about whether those forces that have transformed the Jakarta I once knew -- technology and trade and the flow of people and goods -- can translate into a better life for all Indonesians, for all human beings, a life marked by dignity and opportunity.Now, this kind of development is inseparable from the role of democracy.Today, we sometimes hear that democracy stands in the way of economic progress. This is not a new argument. Particularly in times of change and economic uncertainty, some will say that it is easier to take a shortcut to development by trading away the right of human beings for the power of the state. But that’s not what I saw on my trip to India, and that is not what I see here in Indonesia. Your achievements demonstrate that democracy and development reinforce one another.Like any democracy, you have known setbacks along the way. America is no different. Our own Constitution spoke of the effort to forge a “more perfect union,” and that is a journey that we’ve traveled ever since. We’ve endured civil war and we struggled to extend equal rights to all of our citizens. But it is precisely this effort that has allowed us to become stronger and more prosperous, while also becoming a more just and a more free society.Like other countries that emerged from colonial rule in the last century, Indonesia struggled and sacrificed for the right to determine your destiny. That is what Heroes Day is all about -- an Indonesia that belongs to Indonesians. But you also ultimately decided that freedom cannot mean replacing the strong hand of a colonizer with a strongman of your own.Of course, democracy is messy. Not everyone likes the results of every election. You go through your ups and downs. But the journey is worthwhile, and it goes beyond casting a ballot. It takes strong institutions to check the power -- the concentration of power. It takes open markets to allow individuals to thrive. It takes a free press and an independent justice system to root out abuses and excess, and to insist on accountability. It takes open society and active citizens to reject inequality and injustice.These are the forces that will propel Indonesia forward. And it will require a refusal to tolerate the corruption that stands in the way of opportunity; a commitment to transparency that gives every Indonesian a stake in their government; and a belief that the freedom of Indonesians -- that Indonesians have fought for is what holds this great nation together.That is the message of the Indonesians who have advanced this democratic story -- from those who fought in the Battle of Surabaya 55 years ago today; to the students who marched peacefully for democracy in the 1990s; to leaders who have embraced the peaceful transition of power in this young century. Because ultimately, it will be the rights of citizens that will stitch together this remarkable Nusantara that stretches from Sabang to Merauke, an insistence -- an insistence that every child born in this country should be treated equally, whether they come from Java or Aceh; from Bali or Papua. That all Indonesians have equal rights.That effort extends to the example that Indonesia is now setting abroad. Indonesia took the initiative to establish the Bali Democracy Forum, an open forum for countries to share their experiences and best practices in fostering democracy. Indonesia has also been at the forefront of pushing for more attention to human rights within ASEAN. The nations of Southeast Asia must have the right to determine their own destiny, and the United States will strongly support that right. But the people of Southeast Asia must have the right to determine their own destiny as well. And that’s why we condemned elections in Burma recently that were neither free nor fair. That is why we are supporting your vibrant civil society in working with counterparts across this region. Because there’s no reason why respect for human rights should stop at the border of any country.Hand in hand, that is what development and democracy are about -- the notion that certain values are universal. Prosperity without freedom is just another form of poverty. Because there are aspirations that human beings share -- the liberty of knowing that your leader is accountable to you, and that you won’t be locked up for disagreeing with them; the opportunity to get an education and to be able to work with dignity; the freedom to practice your faith without fear or restriction. Those are universal values that must be observed everywhere.
Thank you.

Kamala Harris,United States of America,2020-09-28,"Good afternoon. On Friday morning I attended the memorial service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the United States Capitol. She was the first woman in our history to lie in state. I sat a few feet away from her flag-draped casket to pay my respects and it was somber and it was personal. And it was an extraordinary moment for me as I’m sure it was for you and millions of Americans and people around the world who felt a connection with the great RBG. It was sad because we lost a giant, not only of the court but of American life. It was a celebration.
Few people in our history have done more to change the lives of the American people than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice. And it was an inspiration and a call to each of us, for each of us to be better, to stay in the fight and stay committed to what motivated Justice Ginsburg the most, that phrase etched in the marble of the United States Supreme Court, “Equal Justice Under Law.”
Justice Ginsburg came to her view of the law not from a textbook but from life, her own life. She often told the story of how she had personally felt the sting of discrimination as a woman, as the mother of a young child trying to find work. And so she committed her life step-by-step, case-by-case, law-by-law, to tear down the obstacles in the way of so many and especially women. Now, we are about to undertake the task of finding her replacement on the United States Supreme Court. Of course, it’s hard to say those words. In truth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be replaced, she was an original, a one of a kind. She combined a steel spine with an ability to extend an open hand, never a closed fist.
She demonstrated you could both hold firm to your principles and still hear those with whom you disagree. That is a lesson that should be ringing in our ears, but it looks like this president and his party are not interested in hearing any of the lessons from Justice Ginsburg. Already the president and his party have chosen to ignore Justice Ginsburg’s final wish, to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen, a wish by the way shared by the American people. And look, it’s not complicated, the voters would simply like to have an opportunity to vote for their president before the Senate votes on a nominee. And that’s not too much to ask but President Trump and his party are not interested in hearing the will of the people, in fact as my sense is, that they’re afraid of what they’re going to be told.
We are not even debating, okay, this is really important. We’re not even debating whether the Senate should hold hearings on a nominee and in election year, we’re not in the middle of an election year, we’re in the middle of an election, an ongoing election. Almost a million Americans have already voted and more will vote this week and next week, and in just a few weeks all Americans will have voted. But President Trump and his party don’t care, they just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can. It’s called raw power.
But President Trump and his party are about to learn something. They may think that it is they who have the power in this country, but they don’t. The American people are the ones who have the power, you have the power and you can make it very clear very soon how you feel about being cut out of this Supreme Court nomination process. Even worse, though then the president and his party ignoring Justice Ginsburg’s final wish, is their determination to appoint a Justice who will undo her life’s work.
Let’s be clear, the Supreme Court will impact our lives in three critical ways. First, President Trump and his party have made it clear they will pick a Justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And in fact just days after the election, the court will hear a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. It’s a decision that could take away healthcare for 20 million Americans. It is a decision that could take away protections for preexisting conditions from more than 100 million people in our country. It’s a decision that could take away Medicare benefits for seniors, it’s a decision that could toss out the rule that says children can be covered on their parents’ healthcare up to the age of 26. All of that will hurt the millions of Americans who have come to rely on the Affordable Care Act.
And what is especially offensive about what President Trump and his party are up to is this, getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time where you could charge a woman more for her healthcare than you can charge a man just because she’s a woman. Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when pregnancy could be considered a preexisting condition. Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take away birth control and contraceptive coverage for women. And get this, this relentless obsession with over turning the Affordable Care Act is driven entirely by a blind rage toward President Obama, and it’s happening at a moment when our country is suffering through the ravages of a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives in our country. Complications from COVID-19 like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next preexisting condition.
In short there are a few things they could do that would be more offensive to the legacy and the life of Justice Ginsburg than to return us to the full-scale policies of discrimination in healthcare toward the women of our country. But that’s what overturning the Affordable Care Act will do, and overturning the Affordable Care Act is a way a nominee gets the support of this president and his party.
As Attorney General of California I defended your right to healthcare. As Senator I voted to protect your right to healthcare, but now President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett, and we know where Judge Barrett stands on the Affordable Care Act. Judge Barrett is on record opposing the decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act. As recently as 2017, she specifically attacked the Chief Justice’s opinion in an article where she said, “Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.”
If nothing else the voters should be very clear about one thing, President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett will overturn the Affordable Care Act and they won’t stop there. They have made clear that they want to overturn Roe v. Wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms. Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights. There is no other issue that’s so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg’s life than undoing the seminal decision in the court’s history that made it clear a woman has a right to make decisions about her own body.
But that’s where President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett are, so let’s make it clear where we are. Let’s vote for healthcare, vote for the Affordable Care Act. Vote as if your life, your choice depends on it because it does. Make it clear to President Trump and to every Republican Senator that if they’re determined to get rid of your healthcare you’ll be just as determined to vote them out of office. And second, vote as if your right to vote depends on it, because it does.
In 2013, the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby v. Holder gutted the hearts of the Voting Rights Act. Soon after numerous states including Texas, and North Carolina, and Alabama, and Mississippi enacted discriminatory laws designed to suppress the people’s right to vote and targeted people of color and students. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like, “Throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.” Right here in North Carolina, a voter suppression law was described by a federal court as having targeted African-Americans with almost surgical precision to deny us the right to vote, surgical precision.
After the people of Florida voted to grant formerly incarcerated citizens the right to vote Republican officials recently enacted a modern-day poll tax to make it harder for those citizens to exercise that very right in this upcoming election. And this modern-day poll tax was upheld by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in large part because of judges appointed by Donald Trump. But you see here’s the thing, he knows he can’t win if the people vote. Donald Trump is weak so he is throwing up every roadblock he can to try and suppress the vote and we the people can not let him get away with it.
Third, what’s at stake? Our ability to make a living, take care of our families and dismantle systemic racism, that’s at stake too. For example, court decisions can determine your ability to earn a living wage, to receive equal pay for equal work, or collectively bargain for your rights at work. With an extra vote on the court, Donald Trump and his party will continue their attack on laws that keep our air clean and our food and water safe and attack any legislation that addresses climate change. They will also continue to divide us and ignore the systemic racism that still plagues our society.
Their decisions could fail to hold the actors in our criminal justice system accountable. Victims of abuse of power by law enforcement could be less likely to succeed on their civil rights claims. The due process rights of criminal defendants could be less likely to be vigorously enforced. These are the decisions that would upend Justice Ginsburg’s life’s work to uphold basic liberties of all Americans regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or economic station.
Yes, she was part of our culture. Yes, we wear those notorious BIG T-shirts with a lot of pride, but since she passed there are parents reminding their children that she helped their lives in concrete yet immeasurable ways. Because of her they could get a job of their dreams, fight for equal pay for their work, marry the person they love, serve the country they love and enjoy the full rights and privileges of citizenship that they deserve free of discrimination. And that legacy, her belief in all of us is at stake.
The outcome of this election more than any other in our lifetime affects every part of your life and every branch of government all at once with consequences that will last generations, and all with the nation in crisis and at a crossroads, the pandemic, the recession, a reckoning on racial injustice, a changing climate, a crisis with the nomination to the Supreme Court. I know that it feels sometimes like this is just too much, too much for us to take, too much for our country to take, and I think that’s what they want you to believe. They want you to feel tired, they want you to feel like your fight doesn’t matter but we will not give up and we will not give in.
We will not let the infection that President Trump has injected into the presidency and into Congress that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other spread to the United States Supreme Court. This election is about more than the presidency or the Senate or the Supreme Court, this election is about our democracy. And as Joe Biden has said from the moment he entered this race it’s about the soul of our nation, who we are, what we stand for, and maybe most importantly, who we want to be.
And that’s what I felt when I said goodbye to Justice Ginsburg. She understood the soul of our nation and what is expected of each of us. And that belief is especially resonant at a place like Shaw University, one of our nation’s first black landmarks of higher learning established just six months after the Civil War. People born into bondage and brutality stood on this very ground as graduates and as scholars. I stand here at Estey Hall, the country’s first university hall built to educate black women in America. A century later and a few months after the Greensboro sit-ins, Ella Baker and fellow students at Shaw established the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee that our dear John Lewis would one day lead.
I stand here on their shoulders and with all of you as the nominee for vice president of the United States. I stand with Joe Biden who will be your next president, I stand with Cal Cunningham who will be the next Senator from the great State of North Carolina, and I stand with them and the American people to fight for a Supreme Court Justice who like Justice Ginsburg truly believes in equal justice under law. May God bless Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, may God bless you all and may God bless the United States of America.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-01-16,"Well, it's similar. We have great love for both countries. These are great countries, great places. It's very interesting how the UK broke away. I sort of, as you know, predicted it. I was in Turnberry and was doing a ribbon cutting because I bought Turnberry, which is doing unbelievably, and I'll tell you, the fact that your pound sterling has gone down? Great. Because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK, as you know. I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing.
Absolutely, very quickly. I'm a big fan of the UK, uh, we're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly -- good for both sides.
She's requesting a meeting and we'll have a meeting right after I get into the White House and it'll be, I think we're gonna get something done very quickly.
People don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country and you know in this country we're gonna go very strong borders from the day I get in. One of the first orders I'm gonna sign Ð day one Ð which I will consider to be Monday as opposed to Friday or Saturday. Right? I mean my day one is gonna be Monday because I don't want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration, but one of the first orders we're gonna be signing is gonna be strong borders.
We don't want people coming in from Syria who we don't know who they are. You know there's no way of vetting these people. I don't want to do what Germany did.
And I've great respect for Merkel, by the way, I have to say. I have great respect for her. But, I, I think it was, I think it was very unfortunate what happened.
And you know I have a love for Germany because my father came from Germany and, I don't want to be in that position. You know the way I look at it, we have enough problems.
Well, from various parts of the world that have lots of terrorism problems.
There will be extreme vetting, it's not gonna be like it is now, they don't even, we don't even have real vetting. The vetting into this country is essentially non-existent as it is, as it was at least, with your country.
Well, it could happen, I mean we're gonna have to see. I mean, we're looking at parts of Europe; parts of the world and parts of Europe, where we have problems where they come in and they're gonna be causing problems. I don't wanna have those problems. Look, I won the election because of strong borders and trade. And military, we're gonna have strong military.
Well, it's great. I mean, I'm very proud of Germany and Germany is very special Bad DŸrkheim, right? This is serious Germany, right? Like this isn't any question -- this is serious Germany. No, I'm very proud of Germany. I love Germany, I love the UK.
Yes, I have been to Germany.
Well, I don't know who she's running against, number one, I'm just saying, I don't know her, I've never met her. As I said, I've had great respect for her. I felt she was a great, great leader. I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from. You'll find out, you got a big dose of it a week ago. So I think she made a catastrophic mistake, very bad mistake. Now, with that being said, I respect her, I like her, but I don't know her. So I can't talk about who I'm gonna be backing -- if anyone.
I look forward to doing it. My mother was very ceremonial, I think that's where I got this aspect because my father was very brick-and-mortar, he was like, and my mother sort of had a flair, she loved the Queen, she loved anything -- she was so proud of the Queen. She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, cause nobody does that like the English. And she had great respect for the Queen, liked her. Anytime the Queen was on television, an event, my mother would be watching. Crazy, right?
Well, the Scottish are known for watching their pennies, so I like to watch my pennies -- I mean I deal in big pennies, that's the problem.
I like order. I like things done in an orderly manner. And certainly the Germans, that's something that they're rather well known for. But I do, I like order and I like strength.
I think it's not good. I think it was a big mistake for Germany. And Germany of all countries, 'cause Germany was one of the toughest in the world for having anybody go in, and, uh, no I think it was a mistake. And I'll see her and I'll meet her and I respect her. And I like her but I think it was a mistake. And people make mistakes but I think it was a very big mistake. I think we should have built safe zones in Syria. Would have been a lot less expensive. Uh, get the Gulf states to pay for 'em who aren't coming through, I mean they've got money that nobody has.
Would have been a lot less expensive than the trauma that Germany's going through now -- but I would have said -- you build safe zones in Syria. Look, this whole thing should have never happened. Iraq should not have been attacked in the first place, all right? It was one of the worst decisions, possibly the worst decision ever made in the history of our country. We've unleashed -- it's like throwing rocks into a beehive. It's one of the great messes of all time. I looked at something, uh, I'm not allowed to show you because it's classified Ð but, I just looked at Afghanistan and you look at the Taliban Ð and you take a look at every, every year its more, more, more, you know they have the different colours Ð and you say, you know Ð what's going on?
Afghanistan is, is not going well. Nothing's going well -- I guess we've been in Afghanistan almost 17 years -- but you look at all of the places, now in all fairness, we haven't let our people do what they're supposed to do. You know we have great military, we're gonna have much greater military because we're gonna have -- you know right now it's very depleted, we're gonna have great military, but we haven't let our military win.
Boeing and Lockheed Martin are you know big contractors for this country and we have an F-35 program that has been very, very severely over budget and behind schedule. Hundreds of billions of dollars over budget and seven years behind schedule. And, uh, they got to shape up.
Isis.
Well, I'd rather not say, I don't want to be like Obama or others where they say -- I always talk about Mosul, you know Mosul's turned out to be a disas -- brutal. So Mosul, so they announced four months ago we're going to attack Mosul -- I said, ""Why do you have to announce it?"". Like you said, ""What's going to be your priority?"". When are you going to attack? When are you gonna, how are you gonna do it? What kind of weapons are you gonna use, right? What time of the day?
Mosul turned out to be a disaster because we announced five months ago that we were going into Mosul, in five months. In four months we said, ""We're getting ready"", by the time we get in, it's been so much talk -- and it's been very hard to take -- you know that, right?
Nah, I think it's a very rough thing. It's a very bad thing, we had a chance to do something when we had the line in the sand and it wasn't -- nothing happened. That was the only time -- and now, it's sort of very late. It's too late. Now everything is over -- at some point it will come to an end -- but Aleppo was nasty. I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town -- they can't even walk and they're shooting 'em -- it almost looks like they're shooting 'em for sport -- ah no, that's a terrible -- that's been a terrible situation. Aleppo has been such a terrible humanitarian situation.
Well, I start off trusting both -- but let's see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.
Sure. Oh sure, I know that. I mean, I understand what's going on, I said a long time ago -- that Nato had problems. Number one it was obsolete, because it was, you know, designed many, many years ago. Number two -- the countries aren't paying what they're supposed to pay. I took such heat, when I said Nato was obsolete. It's obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right -- and now -- it was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, they have a whole division devoted now to terror, which is good.
And the other thing is the countries aren't paying their fair share so we're supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, Nato is very important to me.
Britain is paying. There's five countries that are paying what they're supposed to. Five. It's not much, from 22.
Yeah, I feel very strongly toward Europe -- very strongly toward Europe, yes.
Well, I think you know -- people have to get together and people have to do what they have to do in terms of being fair. OK? They have sanctions on Russia -- let's see if we can make some good deals with Russia. For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that's part of it. But you do have sanctions and Russia's hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit.
Well, I don't want to say what I'm gonna do with the Iran deal. I just don't want to play the cards. I mean, look, I'm not a politician, I don't go out and say, 'I'm gonna do this -- I'm gonna do --', I gotta do what I gotta do. But I don't wanna play. Who plays cards where you show everybody the hand before you play it? But I'm not happy with the Iran deal, I think it's one of the worst deals ever made, I think it's one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen, one of the dumbest, in terms of a deal. Where you give -- where you give a $150 billion back to a country, where you give $1.7 billion in cash -- did you ever see a million dollars in hundred dollar bills? It's a lot. It's a whole -- it's a lot. $1.7 billion in cash. Plane loads. Of, of -- think of it -- plane, many planes. Boom. $1.7 billion. I don't understand. It just shows the power of a president -- when a president of this country can authorise $1.7 billion in cash, that's a lot of power.
No, I think that money is in Swiss bank accounts -- they don't need that money, they're using other money, I think they've taken that money and they've kept it for themselves. That's my opinion.
I think it was terrible. It should have been a veto. I think it was terrible.
Well, the UK may have another chance to veto if what I'm hearing is true, because you know you have a meeting as you know, this weekend. And there are a lot of bad stories being circulated. The problem I have is that it makes it a tougher deal for me to negotiate because the Palestinians are given so much -- even though it's not legally binding it's psychologically binding and it makes it much tougher for me to negotiate. You understand that? Because people are giving away chips, they're giving away all these chips.
Well, I'd like to see the UK veto. I think it'd be great if they veto because I'm not sure the United States is gonna veto, amazingly. They won't, right? You think the United States is gonna veto? I'll have friends who are Jewish have a fundraiser for Obama and I'll say, ""What are you doing? OK -- what are you doing?""
Well, I don't want to comment on that, again, but we'll see what happens.
Yeah, well I would say Merkel is by far one of the most important leaders. 'Cause you look at the UK and you look at the European Union and it's Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out and you were there and you guys wrote it -- put it on the front page: ""Trump said that Brexit is gonna happen"". That was when it was gonna lose easily, you know, everybody thought I was crazy. Obama said to go to the back of the line. Meaning, if it does happen -- and then he had to retract -- that was a bad statement to make.
I think you're doing great. I think it's going great.
I think it's tough. I spoke to the head of the European Union, very fine gentleman called me up.
Yes, ah, to congratulate me on what happened with respect to the election. Uh, I think it's very tough. I think it's tough. People, countries want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity but, I do believe this, if they hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it, you know, entails, I think that you wouldn't have a Brexit. It probably could have worked out but, this was the final straw, this was the final straw that broke the camel's back.
I think people want, people want their own identity, so if you ask me, others, I believe others will leave.
Well, it's doing OK. I mean, you know. What do you trust? I trust the dollar, I'm gonna trust the dollar a lot more in four years than I do now, but sure I mean it's a currency, it's fine. But I do think keeping it together is not gonna be as easy as a lot of people think. And I think this, if refugees keep pouring into different part of Europe. I think it's gonna be very hard to keep it together cause people are angry about it.
Personally, I don't think it matters much for the United States. I never thought it mattered. Look, the EU was formed, partially, to beat the United States on trade, OK? So, I don't really care whether it's separate or together, to me it doesn't matter. I can see this -- I own a big property in Ireland, magnificent property called Doonbeg, what happened is I went for an approval to do this massive, beautiful expansion -- that was when I was a developer, now I couldn't care less about it -- but I learnt a lot because I got the approvals very quickly from Ireland and then Ireland and my people went to the EU to get the approval -- it was going to take years -- that was a very bad thing for Ireland.
Well I can tell you from the environmental standpoint, they were using environmental tricks to stop a project from being built -- I found it to be a very unpleasant experience. To get the approvals from the EU would have taken years -- I don't think that's good for a country like Ireland so you know what I did? I said forget it I'm not gonna build it.
Well, I can tell you that in the last É I think I've done more than any president-elect ever -- Many factories now, many car plants, that were going to be built in other locations are building in Michigan and Ohio -- ya know Ford announced a big one, Fiat Chrysler announced a big one, General Motors is announcing, they're all announcing and I'm not just talking about cars I'm talking about other things, there will be many other things -- you can't allow companies to leave our country, fire all of its employees, move to Mexico, make whatever the product is, and then sell it back in with no tax -- and there will be a very substantial border tax for companies that do that. And when people hear that -- they say we're gonna stay here or we're gonna build in the US -- so they'll go and they'll build their car plant or they'll build their air-conditioning plant and they're gonna sell their air conditioners but they're gonna pay 35 per cent tax... there's not gonna be any tax because they're not gonna leave -- see there's not gonna be any tax -- but the conservative theory is open borders, open borders is all fine. First of all it's bad for security -- for trade it's fine -- the problem is the US is always taken advantage of -- we have hundreds of billions of dollars of trade deficits with China -- we have $805 billion in trade deficits with the world -- ya almost say, who's making these deals when you're losing that kind of money, right -- we actually have almost $800 billion -- almost $800 billion in trade deficits with the world -- so you say, who's making these deals?
Well you're very good at export -- we buy lots of your cars.
It's going to be different -- I mean Germany is a great country, great manufacturing country -- you go down Fifth Avenue everybody has a Mercedes-Benz in front of their building, right -- the fact is that it's been very unfair to the US, it's not a two-way street. How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany. . .
And I will say most of it... most of it is China 'cause China is a tremendous problem.
I would tell them, don't waste their time and money -- unless they want to sell to other countries, that's fine -- if they want to open in Mexico, I love Mexico, I like the president, I like everybody -- but I would tell BMW if they think they're gonna build a plant in Mexico and sell cars into the US without a 35 per cent tax, it's not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen -- so if they want to build cars for the world I would say wish them luck -- they can build cars for the US but they'll be paying a 35 per cent tax on every car that comes into the country... so what I'm saying is they have to build their plant in the US, it will be much better for them and what we're doing -- maybe more importantly, is we're lowering taxes -- corporate taxes -- down to from 15 to 20 per cent and were getting rid of 75 per cent of the regulations -- from 35 down to 15 to 20, we haven't picked the final but from 15 to 20, and we're also gonna let the companies bring back their money with the inversion, corporate inversion.
Well, we've got five -- I think it's five, they say it's 2.5-3, I think it's five, but it's $5 trillion over there and they can't bring back their money so that's part of our tax bill, the money comes back.
I'm pragmatic, look I go in front of crowds -- I had the biggest crowds anybody's ever had for a presidential election and that's tough and when I was fighting with Jeb Bush, ya know ""low energy"" Jeb, he would say, 'Donald Trump is not a conservative', so I'd go in front of 25,000 people and, like in Michigan, where there's massive -- 32,000 people -- and I'm screaming, 'Jeb Bush says I'm not a conservative', they're screaming, 'Who cares?', and I said, 'What do you want? Do you want conservative or a good deal?' And the reason, because Jeb Bush said I'm not a conservative because I don't believe in free trade -- well I do believe in free trade, I love free trade, but it's gotta be smart trade so I call it fair trade -- and the problem, so I said to the people, 'Do you want a conservative or do you want somebody who's gonna make great deals?', and they're all screaming, 'Great deals, great deals' -- they don't care, there are no labels -- ya know there's some people, he is not -- Jeb Bush would stand up -- 'He is not a true conservative' -- who cares -- I am a conservative, but I'm really about making great deals for the people so they get jobs... the people don't care ya know when you're talking -- they don't care, they want good deals -- ya know what? They want their jobs back.
Well, I don't like heroes, I don't like the concept of heroes, the concept of heroes is never great, but certainly you can respect certain people and certainly there are certain people -- but I've learnt a lot from my father -- my father was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens -- he did houses and housing and I learnt a lot about negotiation from my father -- although I also think negotiation is a natural trait, I don't think you can, you either have it or you don't, you get better at it but basically, the people that I know who are great negotiators or great salesmen or great politicians, it's very natural, very natural... I got a letter from somebody, their congressman, they said what you've done is amazing because you were never a politician and you beat all the politicians. He said they added it up -- when I was three months into the campaign, they added it up -- I had three months of experience and the 17 guys I was running against, the Republicans, had 236 years Ð ya know when you add 20 years and 30 years -- so I was three months they were 236 years -- so it's sort of a funny article but I believe it's like hitting a baseball or being a good golfer -- natural ability, to me, is much more important to me than experience and experience is a great thing -- I think it's a great thing -- but I learnt a lot from my father in terms of leadership.
I don't want it to be a disruption -- I love the world, I want the world to be good but we can't go -- I mean look at what's happening to our country -- we are $20 trillion -- we don't know what we're doing -- our military is weak -- we're in wars that never end, we're in Afghanistan now 17 years, they told me this, really -- 17 years, it's the longest war we've ever been in.
Well, we have to have, ya have to have the right people and as you know Pompeo -- who's really been received, did a good job yesterday, head of the CIA -- might I think we have some very great people going in -- I think we have some great people -- ya know I have a lot of respect for the intelligence but a lot of leaks, a lot of fake news coming out, a lot of fake news.
Well, that guy is somebody that you should look at, because whatever he made up about me it was false -- he was supposedly hired by the Republicans and Democrats working together -- even that I don't believe because they don't work together, they work separately -- and they don't hire the same guy -- what they got together? See the whole thing is fake news because it said the, whoever it was, intelligence, the so-called intelligence, said he's an operative of Republicans and Democrats -- they don't work together, they don't work together.
I think probably could be intelligence or it could be, it could be, the Democrats.
When I just heard it -- I ripped up the mat... if I did that in a hotel it'd be the biggest thing -- they'd have me on the front page of The New York Post, right? And the other thing, I can't even, I don't even want to shake hands with people now I hear about this stuff -- ugh.
It's fake news, it was totally made up and I just got a letter from people that went to Russia with me -- did you see that letter -- very rich people, they went with me, they said you were with us, I was with them, I wasn't even here when they said such false stuff.
I left, I wasn't even there... I was there for the Miss Universe contest, got up, got my stuff and I left -- I wasn't even there -- it's all... so if this guy is a British guy you got a lot of problems.
Ya know this is a very, very big change -- I led a very nice life and ya know successful and good and nice and this is a lot different -- but ya know my attitude on that is when you're president, you're in the White House which is a very special place -- you're there for a limited period of time -- who wants to leave? Like I've liked President Obama, he's been very nice, yeah he's been nice one on one, but maybe not so nice in other ways -- but who wants to leave the White House to go to some other place and be away on a vacation? The White House is very special, there's so much work to be done, I'm not gonna be leaving much -- I mean a lot of work to be done -- I'm gonna be in there working, doing what I'm supposed to be doing -- but who wants to leave the White House?
Yea, Camp David is very rustic, it's nice, you'd like it. You know how long you'd like it? For about 30 minutesÉ
@realDonaldTrump I think, I'll keep it... so I've got 46 million people right now -- that's a lot, that's really a lot -- but 46 million -- including Facebook, Twitter and ya know, Instagram so when you think that your 46 million there, I'd rather just let that build up and just keep it @realDonaldTrump, it's working -- and the tweeting, I thought I'd do less of it, but I'm covered so dishonestly by the press -- so dishonestly -- that I can put out Twitter -- and it's not 140, it's now 140, 280 -- I can go bing bing bing and I just keep going and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out -- this morning on television, Fox -- ""Donald Trump, we have breaking news"" -- I put out a thing . . .
I tweeted a little bit, yeah.
I tweeted about the intelligence agencies because it all turned out to be false information.
This -- I have numerous, I have numerous -- I have iPhones, I have . . .
No, I do -- I have one or two people that do during the day I'll just dictate something and they'll type it in.
No, not Steve, but I have people that do it. But ya know the tweeting is interesting because I find it very accurate -- when I get a word out and if I tell something to the papers and they don't write it accurately, it's really bad -- they can't do much when you tweet it and I'm careful about, it's very precise, actually it's very, very precise -- and it comes out breaking news, we have breaking news -- ya know, it's funny, if I did a press release and if I put it out, it wouldn't get nearly -- people would see it the following day -- if I do a news conference, that's a lot of work.
Although the media have been better lately, which is shocking, shocking -- in fact today they have a front-page story saying that Trump's people will never leave him -- ya know all of the voters that I have will never leave -- which is very interesting cause we have great support in the country, tremendous support, I was very surprised at that story.
Oh, really... Ya know what, Jared is such a good kid and he'll make a deal with Israel that no one else can -- ya know he's a natural, he's a great deal, he's a natural -- ya know what I was talking about, natural -- he's a natural deal-maker -- everyone likes him.
Well, not now, she's going to Washington, and they're buying a house or something, but ya know she's got the children, so Jared will be involved as we announced -- no salary, no nothing. If he made peace -- who'd be better at that then Jared, right -- there's something about him . . .
Well, I'll be there -- we'll be there soon -- I would say we'll be here for a little while but and it looks like she'll be here first -- how is she doing over there, by the way, what do you think?
Yeah, May.
Popular. How are they doing with the break-up? How's the break-up going?
Well, we're gonna get a trade deal. Well, how is our Nigel doing? I like him, I think he's a great guy, I think he's a very good guy and he was very supportive. He'd go around the US -- he was saying Trump's gonna win. He was one of the earliest people that said Trump was gonna win. So, he's gotta feel for it. Michael, you should've written that we were gonna win.
Good, I'd love that. That's fantastic -- how to fight terrorism, I can use that.
",Times of London and Bild: Interview with Donald Trump,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-new-york-ny-january-16-2017
Jonathan Aitken,United Kingdom,2015-02-22,"Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken emphasised today the Government’s commitment to providing the taxpayer with better services that cost less and announced further reductions in the size of the Civil Service.
He said “The new plans announced in yesterday’s Budget represent a 10 per cent reduction in real terms in the costs of running central Government between 1993-94 and 1997-98. The public sector is increasing its efficiency while delivering high-quality services to the taxpayer.
“The size of the civil service is falling, too. There are 10,000 fewer civil servants now than in April, and numbers have fallen by 40,000 since the last election. The Civil Service is now at its smallest since 1939. The plans announced in the Budget will ensure that this trend carries on.
“Service to the public is our priority: but we can serve people’s needs without squeezing their pockets. The Government’s programme of Fundamental Expenditure Reviews are covering the whole of Whitehall and improving the cost-effective delivery of front-line services on all fronts. The Defence Costs Study at MoD, which I oversaw, produced annual savings of Pounds 750 million and actually enhanced operational capability. Today the Customs and Excise is announcing the results of its Fundamental Review, which has identified cuts of 4,000 posts by the end of the decade; the NHS will reduce bureaucracy in its HQ and in intermediate layers of management by 21 per cent; the Department of Transport is increasing its efficiency by a fifth; and the Treasury itself is consulting on the recommendations of its Fundamental Review, which could lead to savings in senior posts of more than a quarter, while improving its performance as an economics ministry.
“Running costs spending is being planned and controlled more sensibly, too. The new rules for end-year flexibility mean that Departments can now carry over unspent running costs provision from one year to the next: last-minute splurges on 31 March no longer need to happen.
“July’s Civil Service White Paper forecast that Civil Service numbers could fall significantly below 500,000 in the next four years. The Budget plans for increasing efficiency in the public service put us well on course to achieve that.”

James Buchanan,United States of America,1861-01-08 00:00:00,"At the opening of your present session I called your attention to the dangers which threatened the existence of the Union. I expressed my opinion freely concerning the original causes of those dangers, and recommended such measures as I believed would have the effect of tranquilizing the country and saving it from the peril in which it had been needlessly and most unfortunately involved. Those opinions and recommendations I do not propose now to repeat. My own convictions upon the whole subject remain unchanged.
The fact that a great calamity was impending over the nation was even at that time acknowledged by every intelligent citizen. It had already made itself felt throughout the length and breadth of the land. The necessary consequences of the alarm thus produced were most deplorable. The imports fell off with a rapidity never known before, except in time of war, in the history of our foreign commerce; the Treasury was unexpectedly left without the means which it had reasonably counted upon to meet the public engagements; trade was paralyzed; manufactures were stopped; the best public securities suddenly sunk in the market; every species of property depreciated more or less, and thousands of poor men who depended upon their daily labor for their daily bread were turned out of employment.
I deeply regret that I am not able to give you any information upon the state of the Union which is more satisfactory than what I was then obliged to communicate. On the contrary, matters are still worse at present than they then were. When Congress met, a stronge hope pervaded the whole public mind that some amicable adjustment of the subject would speedily be made by the representatives of the States and of the people which might restore peace between the conflicting sections of the country. That hope has been diminished by every hour of delay, and as the prospect of a bloodless settlement fades away the public distress becomes more and more aggravated. As evidence of this it is only necessary to say that the Treasury notes authorized by the act of 17th of December last were advertised according to the law and that no responsible bidder offered to take any considerable sum at par at a lower rate of interest than 12 per cent. From these facts it appears that in a government organized like ours domestic strife, or even a well-grounded fear of civil hostilities, is more destructive to our public and private interests than the most formidable foreign war.
In my annual message I expressed the conviction, which I have long deliberately held, and which recent reflection has only tended to deepen and confirm, that no State has a right by its own act to secede from the Union or throw off its federal obligations at pleasure. I also declared my opinion to be that even if that right existed and should be exercised by any State of the Confederacy the executive department of this Government had no authority under the Constitution to recognize its validity by acknowledging the independence of such State. This left me no alternative, as the chief executive officer under the Constitution of the United States, but to collect the public revenues and to protect the public property so far as this might be practicable under existing laws. This is still my purpose. My province is to execute and not to make the laws. It belongs to Congress exclusively to repeal, to modify, or to enlarge their provisions to meet exigencies as they may occur. I possess no dispensing power.
I certainly had no right to make aggressive war upon any State, and I am perfectly satisfied that the Constitution has wisely withheld that power even from Congress. But the right and the duty to use military force defensively against those who resist the Federal officers in the execution of their legal functions and against those who assail the property of the Federal Government is clear and undeniable.
But the dangerous and hostile attitude of the States toward each other has already far transcended and cast in the shade the ordinary executive duties already provided for by law, and has assumed such vast and alarming proportions as to place the subject entirely above and beyond Executive control. The fact can not be disguised that we are in the midst of a great revolution. In all its various bearings, therefore, I commend the question to Congress as the only human tribunal under Providence possessing the power to meet the existing emergency. To them exclusively belongs the power to declare war or to authorize the employment of military force in all cases contemplated by the Constitution, and they alone possess the power to remove grievances which might lead to war and to secure peace and union to this distracted country. On them, and on them alone, rests the responsibility.
The Union is a sacred trust left by our Revolutionary fathers to their descendants, and never did any other people inherit so rich a legacy. It has rendered us prosperous in peace and triumphant in war. The national flag has floated in glory over every sea. Under its shadow American citizens have found protection and respect in all lands beneath the sun. If we descend to considerations of purely material interest, when in the history of all time has a confederacy been bound together by such strong ties of mutual interest? Each portion of it is dependent on all and all upon each portion for prosperity and domestic security. Free trade throughout the whole supplies the wants of one portion from the productions of another and scatters wealth everywhere. The great planting and farming States require the aid of the commercial and navigating States to send their productions to domestic and foreign markets and to furnish the naval power to render their transportation secure against all hostile attacks.
Should the Union perish in the midst of the present excitement, we have already had a sad foretaste of the universal suffering which would result from its destruction. The calamity would be severe in every portion of the Union and would be quite as great, to say the least, in the Southern as in the Northern States. The greatest aggravation of the evil, and that which would place us in the most unfavorable light both before the world and posterity, is, as I am firmly convinced, that the secession movement has been chiefly based upon a misapprehension at the South of the sentiments of the majority in several of the Northern States. Let the question be transferred from political assemblies to the ballot box, and the people themselves would speedily redress the serious grievances which the South have suffered. But, in Heaven&#39;s name, let the trial be made before we plunge into armed conflict upon the mere assumption that there is no other alternative. Time is a great conservative power. Let us pause at this momentous point and afford the people, both North and South, an opportunity for reflection. Would that South Carolina had been convinced of this truth before her precipitate action! I therefore appeal through you to the people of the country to declare in their might that the Union must and shall be preserved by all constitutional means. I most earnestly recommend that you devote yourselves exclusively to the question how this can be accomplished in peace. All other questions, when compared to this, sink into insignificance. The present is no time for palliations. Action, prompt action, is required. A delay in Congress to prescribe or to recommend a distinct and practical proposition for conciliation may drive us to a point from which it will be almost impossible to recede.
A common ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produced is surely not unattainable. The proposition to compromise by letting the North have exclusive control of the territory above a certain line and to give Southern institutions protection below that line ought to receive universal approbation. In itself, indeed, it may not be entirely satisfactory, but when the alternative is between a reasonable concession on both sides and a destruction of the Union it is an imputation upon the patriotism of Congress to assert that its members will hesitate for a moment.
Even now the danger is upon us. In several of the States which have not yet seceded the forts, arsenals, and magazines of the United States have been seized. This is by far the most serious step which has been taken since the commencement of the troubles. This public property has long been left without garrisons and troops for its protection, because no person doubted its security under the flag of the country in any State of the Union. Besides, our small Army has scarcely been sufficient to guard our remote frontiers against Indian incursions. The seizure of this property, from all appearances, has been purely aggressive, and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a State or States to remain in the Union.
At the beginning of these unhappy troubles I determined that no act of mine should increase the excitement in either section of the country. If the political conflict were to end in a civil war, it was my determined purpose not to commence it nor even to furnish an excuse for it by any act of this Government. My opinion remains unchanged that justice as well as sound policy requires us still to seek a peaceful solution of the questions at issue between the North and the South. Entertaining this conviction, I refrained even from sending reenforcements to Major Anderson, who commanded the forts in Charleston Harbor, until an absolute necessity for doing so should make itself apparent, lest it might unjustly be regarded as a menace of military coercion, and thus furnish, if not a provocation, at least a pretext for an outbreak on the part of South Carolina. No necessity for these reenforcements seemed to exist. I was assured by distinguished and upright gentlemen of South Carolina that no attack upon Major Anderson was intended, but that, on the contrary, it was the desire of the State authorities as much as it was my own to avoid the fatal consequences which must eventually follow a military collision.
And here I deem it proper to submit for your information copies of a communication, dated December 28, 1860, addressed to me by R. W. Barnwell, J. H. Adams, and James L. Orr, ""commissioners"" from South Carolina, with the accompanying documents, and copies of my answer thereto, dated December 31.
In further explanation of Major Anderson&#39;s removal from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter, it is proper to state that after my answer to the South Carolina ""commissioners"" the War Department received a letter from that gallant officer, dated on the 27th of December, 1860, the day after this movement, from which the following is an extract:
I will add as my opinion that many things convinced me that the authorities of the State designed to proceed to a hostile act.
Evidently referring to the orders, dated December 11, of the late Secretary of War.
Under this impression I could not hesitate that it was my solemn duty to move my command from a fort which we could not probably have held longer than forty-eight or sixty hours to this one, where my power of resistance is increased to a very great degree.
It will be recollected that the concluding part of these orders was in the following terms:
The smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt to take possession of either one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance. You are also authorized to take similar defensive steps whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.

John F. Kennedy,United States of America,1963-09-20 00:00:00,"Mr. President--as one who has taken some interest in the election of Presidents, I want to congratulate you on your election to this high office--Mr. Secretary General, delegates to the United Nations, ladies and gentlemen: We meet again in the quest for peace. Twenty-four months ago, when I last had the honor of addressing this body, the shadow of fear lay darkly across the world. The freedom of West Berlin was in immediate peril. Agreement on a neutral Laos seemed remote. The mandate of the United Nations in the Congo was under fire. The financial outlook for this organization was in doubt. Dag Hammarskjold was dead. The doctrine of troika was being pressed in his place, and atmospheric nuclear tests had been resumed by the Soviet Union. Those were anxious days for mankind-and some men wondered aloud whether this organization could survive. But the 16th and 17th General Assemblies achieved not only survival but progress. Rising to its responsibility, the United Nations helped reduce the tensions and helped to hold back the darkness. Today the clouds have lifted a little so that new rays of hope can break through. The pressures on West Berlin appear to be temporarily eased. Political unity in the Congo has been largely restored. A neutral coalition in Laos, while still in difficulty, is at least in being. The integrity of the United Nations Secretariat has been reaffirmed. A United Nations Decade of Development is under way. And, for the first time in 17 years of effort, a specific step has been taken to limit the nuclear arms race. I refer, of course, to the treaty to ban nuclear tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and under water--concluded by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States--and already signed by nearly 100 countries. It has been hailed by people the world over who are thankful to be free from the fears of nuclear fallout, and I am confident that on next Tuesday at 10:30 o'clock in the morning it will receive the overwhelming endorsement of the Senate of the United States. The world has not escaped from the darkness. The long shadows of conflict and crisis envelop us still. But we meet today in an atmosphere of rising hope, and at a moment of comparative calm. My presence here today is not a sign of crisis, but of confidence. I am not here to report on a new threat to the peace or new signs of war. I have come to salute the United Nations and to show the support of the American people for your daily deliberations. For the value of this body's work is not dependent on the existence of emergencies-nor can the winning of peace consist only of dramatic victories. Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures. And however undramatic the pursuit of peace, that pursuit must go on. Today we may have reached a pause in the cold war--but that is not a lasting peace. A test ban treaty is a milestone--but it is not the millennium. We have not been released from our obligations--we have been given an opportunity. And if we fail to make the most of this moment and this momentum-if we convert our new-found hopes and understandings into new walls and weapons of hostility--if this .pause in the cold war merely leads to its renewal and not to its end--then the indictment of posterity will rightly point its finger at us all. But if we can stretch this pause into a period of cooperation--if both sides can now gain new confidence and experience in concrete collaborations for peace--if we can now be as bold and farsighted in the control of deadly weapons as we have been in their creation-then surely this first small step can be the start of a long and fruitful journey. The task of building the peace lies with the leaders of every nation, large and small. For the great powers have no monopoly on conflict or ambition. The cold war is not the only expression of tension in this world-and the nuclear race is not the only arms race. Even little wars are dangerous in a nuclear world. The long labor of peace is an undertaking for every nation--and in this effort none of us can remain unaligned. To this goal none can be uncommitted. The reduction of global tension must not be an excuse for the narrow pursuit of self-interest. If the Soviet Union and the United States, with all of their global interests and clashing commitments of ideology, and with nuclear weapons still aimed at each other today, can find areas of common interest and agreement, then surely other nations can do the same--nations caught in regional conflicts, in racial issues, or in the death throes of old colonialism. Chronic disputes which divert precious resources from the needs of the people or drain the energies of both sides serve the interests of no one--and the badge of responsibility in the modern world is a willingness to seek peaceful solutions. It is never too early to try; and it's never too late to talk; and it's high time that many disputes on the agenda of this Assembly were taken off the debating schedule and placed on the negotiating table. The fact remains that the United States, as a major nuclear power, does have a special responsibility in the world. It is, in fact, a threefold responsibility--a responsibility to our own citizens; a responsibility to the people of the whole world who are affected by our decisions; and to the next generation of humanity. We believe the Soviet Union also has these special responsibilities--and that those responsibilities require our two nations to concentrate less on our differences and more on the means of resolving them peacefully. For too long both of us have increased our military budgets, our nuclear stockpiles, and our capacity to destroy all life on this hemisphere--human, animal, vegetable--without any corresponding increase in our security. Our conflicts, to be sure, are real. Our concepts of the world are different. No service is performed by failing to make clear our disagreements. A central difference is the belief of the American people in self-determination for all people. We believe that the people of Germany and Berlin must be free to reunite their capital and their country. We believe that the people of Cuba must be free to secure the fruits of the revolution that have been betrayed from within and exploited from without. In short, we believe that all the world--in Eastern Europe as well as Western, in Southern Africa as well as Northern, in old nations as well as new--that people must be free to choose their own future, without discrimination or dictation, without coercion or subversion. These are the basic differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, and they cannot be concealed. So long as they exist, they set limits to agreement, and they forbid the relaxation of our vigilance. Our defense around the world will be maintained for the protection of freedom--and our determination to safeguard that freedom will measure up to any threat or challenge. But I would say to the leaders of the Soviet Union, and to their people, that if either of our countries is to be fully secure, we need a much better weapon than the H-bomb--a weapon better than ballistic missiles or nuclear submarines--and that better weapon is peaceful cooperation. We have, in recent years, agreed on a limited test ban treaty, on an emergency communications link between our capitals, on a statement of principles for disarmament, on an increase in cultural exchange, on cooperation in outer space, on the peaceful exploration of the Antarctic, and on tempering last year's crisis over Cuba. I believe, therefore, that the Soviet Union and the United States, together with their allies, can achieve further agreements-agreements which spring from our mutual interest in avoiding mutual destruction. There can be no doubt about the agenda of further steps. We must continue to seek agreements on measures which prevent war by accident or miscalculation. We must continue to seek agreement on safeguards against surprise attack, including observation posts at key points. We must continue to seek agreement on further measures to curb the nuclear arms race, by controlling the transfer of nuclear weapons, converting fissionable materials to peaceful purposes, and banning underground testing, with adequate inspection and enforcement. We must continue to seek agreement on a freer flow of information and people from East to West and West to East. We must continue to seek agreement, encouraged by yesterday's affirmative response to this proposal by the Soviet Foreign Minister, on an arrangement to keep weapons of mass destruction out of outer space. Let us get our negotiators back to the negotiating table to work out a practicable arrangement to this end. In these and other ways, let us move up the steep and difficult path toward comprehensive disarmament, securing mutual confidence through mutual verification, and building the institutions of peace as we dismantle the engines of war. We must not let failure to agree on all points delay agreements where agreement is possible. And we must not put forward proposals for propaganda purposes. Finally, in a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a special capacity-in the field of space--there is room for new cooperation, for further joint efforts in the regulation and exploration of space. I include among these possibilities a joint expedition to the moon. Space offers no problems of sovereignty; by resolution of this Assembly, the members of the United Nations have foresworn any claim to territorial rights in outer space or on celestial bodies, and declared that international law and the United Nations Charter will apply. Why, therefore, should man's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition? Why should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research, construction, and expenditure? Surely we should explore whether the scientists and astronauts of our two countries--indeed of all the world--cannot work together in the conquest of space, sending some day in this decade to the moon not the respresentatives of a single nation, but the representatives of all of our countries. All these and other new steps toward peaceful cooperation may be possible. Most of them will require on our part full consultation with our allies--for their interests are as much involved as our own, and we will not make an agreement at their expense. Most of them will require long and careful negotiation. And most of them will require a new approach to the cold war--a desire not to ""bury"" one's adversary, but to compete in a host of peaceful arenas, in ideas, in production, and ultimately in service to all mankind. The contest will continue--the contest between those who see a monolithic world and those who believe in diversity--but it should be a contest in leadership and responsibility instead of destruction, a contest in achievement instead of intimidation. Speaking for the United States of America, I welcome such a contest. For we believe that truth is stronger than error--and that freedom is more enduring than coercion. And in the contest for a better life, all the world can be a winner. The effort to improve the conditions of man, however, is not a task for the few. It is the task of all nations--acting alone, acting in groups, acting in the United Nations, for plague and pestilence, and plunder and pollution, the hazards of nature, and the hunger of children are the foes of every nation. The earth, the sea, and the air are the concern of every nation. And science, technology, and education can be the ally of every nation. Never before has man had such capacity to control his own environment, to end thirst and hunger, to conquer poverty and disease, to banish illiteracy and massive human misery. We have the power to make this the best generation of mankind in the history of the world--or to make it the last. The United States since the close of the war has sent over $100 billion worth of assistance to nations seeking economic viability. And 2 years ago this week we formed a Peace Corps to help interested nations meet the demand for trained manpower. Other industrialized nations whose economies were rebuilt not so long ago with some help from us are now in turn recognizing their responsibility to the less developed nations. The provision of development assistance by individual nations must go on. But the United Nations also must play a larger role in helping bring to all men the fruits of modern science and industry. A United Nations conference on this subject he;d earlier this year at Geneva opened new vistas for the developing countries. Next year a United Nations Conference on Trade will consider the needs of these nations for new markets. And more than four-fifths of the entire United Nations system can be found today mobilizing the weapons of science and technology for the United Nations' Decade of Development. But more can be done.--A world center for health communications under the World Health Organization could warn of epidemics and the adverse effects of certain drugs as well as transmit the results of new experiments and new discoveries.--Regional research centers could advance our common medical knowledge and train new scientists and doctors for new nations.--A global system of satellites could provide communication and weather information for all corners of the earth.--A worldwide program of conservation could protect the forest and wild game preserves now in danger of extinction for all time, improve the marine harvest of food from our oceans, and prevent the contamination of air and water by industrial as well as nuclear pollution.--And, finally, a worldwide program of farm productivity and food distribution, similar to our country's ""Food for Peace"" program, could now give every child the food he needs. But man does not live by bread alone-and the members of this organization are committed by the Charter to promote and respect human rights. Those rights are not respected when a Buddhist priest is driven from his pagoda, when a synagogue is shut down, when a Protestant church cannot open a mission, when a Cardinal is forced into hiding, or when a crowded church service is bombed. The United States of America is opposed to discrimination and persecution on grounds of race and religion anywhere in the world, including our own Nation. We are working to right the wrongs of our own country. Through legislation and administrative action, through moral and legal commitment, this Government has launched a determined effort to rid our Nation of discrimination which has existed far too longin education, in housing, in transportation, in employment, in the civil service, in recreation, and in places of public accommodation. And therefore, in this or any other forum, we do not hesitate to condemn racial or religious injustice, whether committed or permitted by friend or foe. I know that some of you have experienced discrimination in this country. But I ask you to believe me when I tell you that this is not the wish of most Americans--that we share your regret and resentment--and that we intend to end such practices for all time to come, not only for our visitors, but for our own citizens as well. I hope that not only our Nation but all other multiracial societies will meet these standards of fairness and justice. We are opposed to apartheid and all forms of human oppression. We do not advocate the rights of black Africans in order to drive out white Africans. Our concern is the right of all men to equal protection under the law--and since human rights are indivisible, this body cannot stand aside when those rights are abused and neglected by any member state. New efforts are needed if this Assembly's Declaration of Human Rights, now 15 years old, is to have full meaning. And new means should be found for promoting the free expression and trade of ideas--through travel and communication, and through increased exchanges of people, and books, and broadcasts. For as the world renounces the competition of weapons, competition in ideas must flourish--and that competition must be as full and as fair as possible. The United States delegation will be prepared to suggest to the United Nations initiatives in the pursuit of all the goals. For this is an organization for peace--and peace cannot come without work and without progress. The peacekeeping record of the United Nations has been a proud one, though its tasks are always formidable. We are fortunate to have the skills of our distinguished Secretary General and the brave efforts of those who have been serving the cause of peace in the Congo, in the Middle East, in Korea and Kashmir, in West New Guinea and Malaysia. But what the United Nations has done in the past is less important than the tasks for the future. We cannot take its peacekeeping machinery for granted. That machinery must be soundly financed-which it cannot be if some members are allowed to prevent it from meeting its obligations by failing to meet their own. The United Nations must be supported by all those who exercise their franchise here. And its operations must be backed to the end. Too often a project is undertaken in the excitement of a crisis and then it begins to lose its appeal as the problems drag on and the bills pile up. But we must have the steadfastness to see every enterprise through. It is, for example, most important not to jeopardize the extraordinary United Nations gains in the Congo. The nation which sought this organization's help only 3 years ago has now asked the United Nations' presence to remain a little longer. I believe this Assembly should do what is necessary to preserve the gains already made and to protect the new nation in its struggle for progress. Let us complete what we have started. For ""No man who puts his hand to the plow and looks back,"" as the Scriptures tell us, ""No man who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.""I also hope that the recent initiative of several members in preparing standby peace forces for United Nations call will encourage similar commitments by others. This Nation remains ready to provide logistic and other material support. Policing, moreover, is not enough without provision for pacific settlement. We should increase the resort to special missions of factfinding and conciliation, make greater use of the International Court of Justice, and accelerate the work of the International Law Commission. The United Nations cannot survive as a static organization. Its obligations are increasing as well as its size. Its Charter must be changed as well as its customs. The authors of that Charter did not intend that it be frozen in perpetuity. The science of weapons and war has made us all, far more than 18 years ago in San Francisco, one world and one human race, with one common destiny. In such a world, absolute -sovereignty no longer assures us of absolute security. The conventions of peace must pull abreast and then ahead of the inventions of war. The United Nations, building on its successes and learning from its failures, must be developed into a genuine world security system. But peace does not rest in charters and covenants alone. It lies in the hearts and minds of all people. And if it is east out there, then no act, no pact, no treaty, no organization can hope to preserve it without the support and the wholehearted commitment of all people. So let us not rest all our hopes on parchment and on paper; let us strive to build peace, a desire for peace, a willingness to work for peace, in the hearts and minds of all of our people. I believe that we can. I believe the problems of human destiny are not beyond the reach of human beings. Two years ago I told this body that the United States had proposed, and was willing to sign, a limited test ban treaty. Today that treaty has been signed. It will not put an end to war. It will not remove basic conflicts. It will not secure freedom for all. But it can be a lever, and Archimedes, in explaining the principles of the lever, was said to have declared to his friends: ""Give me a place where I can stand--and I shall move the world.""My fellow inhabitants of this planet: Let us take our stand here in this Assembly of nations. And let us see if we, in our own time, can move the world to a just and lasting peace.

The first responders have been -- so many first responders right here, and you've been incredible. Law enforcement has been incredible. And, frankly, you didn't need law enforcement, but they've done it so great.
They all just chipped in and helped everybody. It's love. It's great love. Your governor is here with us, your senators are here right now with us, and Secretary Nielsen -- and we've just said the A-plus job. We're going to take care of -- FEMA is here and doing an incredible job. I think you know that. And we said we're going to just lay it out.
These are incredible people. We just met some of the survivors and family members, and what they've been through is incredible. One woman lost 10 people in her family, and -- an incredible woman. And she -- I said, ""How -- how did it go?"" She said, ""I lost 10. Ten people."" And a couple of others lost two and three.
I've never seen anything like it. I just want to thank you. On behalf of the First Lady and myself, I want to thank you for the job you do. You're incredible people. We couldn't get here fast enough. I wanted to come the day it happened, but I spoke with the Governor, and she said, ""Just give us a little more time.
We need a little more time."" And already, the job is really great -- the job you've done. So thank you very much. FEMA is laying it out. They're all here. They're all heart. A lot of folks coming in. A lot of folks coming in. And so, Secretary, I want to thank you for a great job, and thank all of the folks at FEMA. And tell them to stay as long as they have to stay, whatever it is. Also a lot of the folks get aid, and we're providing all of the aid.
So you'll see the FEMA people; let them know as soon as you can so they know that, because a lot of people don't know that. And they really need aid, in this case. And, again, we love you all. We thank you all. We love the state of Alabama. Georgia got hit a little bit, and we're going to be talking about that later.
We met the Governor; we met with Brian a little while ago. He's very engaged, I can tell you that. Thank you very much everybody on behalf of the country and on behalf of the United States. We want to thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-06-26,"Thank you, Bill -- a special man. Thank you very much. And he's a fighter. He's a fighter for good. We like fighters. We like fighters for good. It's wonderful to be back here with so many friends, and patriots, pastors, rabbis, and a record number of students. Thank you all for the tireless work that your steadfast support and your daily prayers just -- it's incredible what it's done.
And just keep them coming. Very important. Keep them coming. We're in an interesting time in our country's history and we're doing great. Just keep them coming. It's very fragile. You know, it's one vote. It's one Justice. It's one little thing and it can all change. You have to be very hard, very vigilant.
You have to go out and vote. November 3rd is a big date next year. November 3rd. Mark it down. But I want to thank you for your voice, your time, and your energy. And to knock on doors and make calls and educate voters and mobilize your fellow Americans, because, with your help, we will soon once again win a historic victory for life, for family, for faith, and for freedom.
After just two and a half years, our country is soaring, our communities are thriving, our economy is booming perhaps like never before. We may have the greatest economy in the history of our country. And we are once again defending and promoting our great American values. And we're saying, ""Merry Christmas"" again.
Do you notice? Remember? Remember? I usually save that for November, December, but I was just thinking -- as I mentioned, I was saying, we're going to say, ""Merry Christmas."" They were all taking it down off the department stores -- everything. You'd see a big red -- they'd say, ""Happy Holidays."" No ""Merry Christmas."" They're saying, ""Merry Christmas,"" again.
It's very interesting. And they're proud of it. Since the election, we've created 6 million new jobs. Nobody would've believed that. We have lifted more than 6 million Americans off of food stamps and we're getting Americans off welfare and back into the labor force. And they're so happy, and they're making money, and they love what they're doing.
And you've seen me say this before -- where is Shaun? Is he here? Our NFL -- not only NFL, but he's MVP. Where is Shaun? Is he here? Where is he? Because we just went over some numbers. Stand up. MVP. I'm going to read his book. He gave me his book in 2005, 2006? What was that, Shaun? 2005 MVP. And I said, ""Do you think I could take him in an arm-wrestling contest?"" And his good friend said, ""Don't do it, Mr. President."" Right?
Thank you, Shaun. I'm going to read the book on the plane. I'm going to Japan right after this. So, I'll meeting with some nice fellows. Our other nations -- competitive nations and competitors, and that's okay. We're doing great. We're doing better than any of them. Thank you, Shaun. Thank you. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have reached the lowest rates in the history of our country.
The history -- the whole history. And if I was wrong about that, Shaun -- if I made that statement and if it wasn't exactly correct, all of those people back there -- and there's a lot of them -- you'd see before the -- before I was even finished, there would be headlines. I have to be very careful, Shaun.
The women's unemployment rate is now the lowest in 65 years. And to help American families, we doubled the child tax credit. That was -- Ivanka Trump worked hard on that. We are fighting for all Americans and we are embracing the faith community. We are embracing it like it hasn't been embraced in many, many years.
You know that. And when we're doing that, we're uplifting our nation. We're greatly uplifting our nation. When I asked for your support in 2016, Americans of faith were under assault. But the shameful attempt to suppress religious believers ended the day I took the oath of office. And now, by the way, because of what we did with respect to the Johnson Amendment -- you know what I'm talking about -- our leaders, like all of the people that have been so supportive -- our pastors, our ministers, our priests, our rabbis -- all of our religious leaders -- every -- we're allowed to speak again.
We're allowed to talk without having to lose your tax exemption, your tax status, and being punished for speaking. And the people that we most want to hear, our great clergy, is now able to speak without fear of retribution. And I'm very proud of that. I said I was going to do that. I'm very proud of it. They can speak -- unless they speak against me, in which case, we'll bring it back.
We'll bring back that Johnson Amendment so fast, Shaun. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. They're going to take it seriously. You know, they're going to go out -- ""We have breaking news."" They're going to say, ""See, I told you he wants to be a dictator. I told you that."" They are unbelievable, what they do. You have to say it with a big smile on your face, otherwise -- even that doesn't work.
Bill understands that. Right, Bill? We're cherishing our nation's religious heritage once again. My administration has taken historic action to protect religious liberty. We are protecting the conscience rights of doctors, and nurses, and teachers, and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. We're with them.
We've made a lot of progress. We've taken action to uphold free speech on college campuses. Colleges are now, by the way, looking around very carefully when they throw conservatives and religious folks off of their campuses. Looking around very, very carefully because they have a big, fat, beautiful monetary penalty to pay.
I haven't heard too much about it since I did that a few months ago. Do you notice that? I haven't heard -- I haven't heard so much about that. We give them billions and billions of dollars, and then they don't let people speak. And I don't care -- liberal, conservative, it doesn't matter. Republican, Democrat.
But you can't do that. We're preserving our country's vital tradition of faith-based adoption. And we are proudly defending the sanctity of life. Unfortunately, Democrat politicians have become increasingly hostile to pro-life Americans who want to help more children find a loving home and share their dreams with the world.
Virtually every top Democrat lawmaker now supports taxpayer-funded abortion, right up to the moment of birth. And, by the way, if you watched Virginia, the governor -- after the moment of birth.
Nobody believed it. I had never heard of it. I don't think anybody had heard of it. When he talked about wrapping the child and then discussing with the mother whether or not she wants to keep -- the child is born. So that becomes an execution. That becomes an execution. Every child born and unborn is made in the holy image of God, and that is why I have asked Congress to prohibit the late-term abortion of babies.
And they'll do that. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you. During my first week in office, I reinstated the Mexico City Policy. People thought that wasn't going to be happening. We've issued a final rule to prohibit Title X taxpayer funding from subsidizing the abortion industry.
And just last month, our administration ended federal funding of fetal tissue research. All of us are working to foster a culture that celebrates the sacred worth of every human life. And this could all change very quickly. Just remember. We've done things that nobody thought possible. We've done things that are so good and so righteous and also so fragile.
The wrong person in office -- in this office, right here -- can change it very quickly. Bill will tell you that. Bill understands this system probably better than anybody. And Bill will tell you that. We're building a society that values the limitless potential of every person. And we're strengthening the bonds that tie us together in the wondrous tapestry of creation.
Here with us today is someone who shows us the power and majesty of life. I was very proud to host her in the Oval Office earlier this year: Katie Shaw. Where is Katie? Where is Katie Shaw? Thank you, Katie. We had a great meeting -- right? -- in the Oval Office. Thank you, Katie. You look well, really well.
Thank you very much. Thank you. So nice. She was in the Oval Office and really made a great impression on everybody. And it was very exciting. Thank you very much for being here. Katie is from Indiana. She was born with Down syndrome and now works at a local store, does a fantastic job; volunteers in her community; and has testified before lawmakers.
As Katie said, ""It's a wonderful life. I've made the world a better place."" And, Katie, yes, you have. You have. Our nation is uplifted by incredible Americans like Katie who fight for the dignity of all humanity. My administration has also taken historic action to protect Americans' rights enshrined in the Constitution.
Democrats are determined to pack the courts with radical-left judges who will impose their own far-left views on the American people. That is why I will soon appoint my 145th judge to interpret the Constitution as written. You know, normally, when a President assumes his position in the White House, you have no judges.
You come as they retire. They get sick, they pass away, things happen, and they leave and you'll get one, two, three. I inherited 138 empty spots -- 138. I said, ""This is impossible."" Because President Obama either didn't get them through or couldn't get them through or something happened. But I said, ""How many judges do I have?"" ""Sir, you have 138."" Federal judges -- 138 -- which is, percentagewise, going to be a record.
But the only one that has a record greater than mine, percentagewise, is George Washington. I'll never beat that record. He had 100 percent. But I have more. The only thing -- we have more, but he had 100 percent. He appointed everybody. But think of that, 145 judges we're up to. I had 138, and then through attrition and things, we picked up some additional -- and we're putting fantastic people on the courts and it makes such a big difference.
Nobody would believe. And we have two new Supreme Court Justices: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. And exactly a year ago today, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the First Amendment rights of pregnancy care centers. And just last week, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the Peace Cross -- wasn't that nice, right?
There's one that would have come down. In a memorial -- a beautiful memorial in Maryland which honors our heroes of World War One -- but it's in the form of a cross, and they said it can stand on public land for all to see. Isn't that nice? It's so beautiful and it takes up such an important place in that area, in that whole state, and they wanted to rip it down.
They wanted to take it down because it was a cross. And we won that one just two days ago in the Supreme Court. Isn't that great? Americans' belief in God has forged the character of our country and made our nation a light unto the world. We are respected again as a nation, I will tell you that. And I'm not only talking about from a religious standpoint.
Our country is respected again. Today, we are excited to be joined by hundreds of college students, including eight students from Liberty University -- great school -- who just got back from a mission trip to Oklahoma. Where are you? Stand up, please. Wow. That's fantastic. It's a great school and Jerry Falwell is a friend of mine.
And he was with me right from the beginning, and he's so happy about it. I could tell you stories. He said that he was so honored to be there. He understood from the beginning what was going on. And he does say -- and so did Pastor Robert Jeffress, a great friend of mine -- he would say, ""Our President may not be the best at the Bible."" ""He may not have read it 2,000 times, but he's the best for us."" And that's good.
That's good. That's good. Thank you. And who are those 17 percent, right? Ralph asked that question. I do -- I want to talk to them. As one of the great students, Phoebe, recently said, ""Every day on the trip is a chance to love others the way Christ loves us."" Where's Phoebe?
Stand up, Phoebe. Thank you very much. Very nice. Beautiful. So I want to thank Phoebe and I want to thank the students who are here with us today from all over the country. You're really -- incredible what you're doing. And I think people have no idea the numbers we're talking about. You know, you see all of this stuff on television and they're noisy, they're loud, they're rude, they disgrace us in so many ways, and they get publicity.
But they don't realize that we have more than they do. They really don't. People don't realize it. We have more than they do. I see it all the time -- the young people that come. The other day, in Orlando, we had a rally that was unbelievable. It filled up -- we had thousands and thousands of people outside of the Orlando Magic arena, where they play the big basketball games.
The floor was packed. And it was an incredible thing to see. And then outside, there were -- I mean, literally tens of thousands of people couldn't get in. And then there were thousands that we said, ""Don't come."" We actually were putting out notices: ""Please don't come."" There's something going on. That's a great thing.
It's continuing, I think, even stronger than that great November day in 2016. I really believe it's stronger. And, you know, the media likes to talk about the energy the Left has. I don't think they have energy. They're trying to destroy themselves. And it's negative energy. It really is. It's like a negative energy, when you see what they want to do. And I think we have more energy than we've ever had.
And I said it the other day: I think the Republicans have much more energy than the Democrats -- though maybe I'm wrong, but I really believe that. And they like to talk about 2018. Well, number one, in 2018, I didn't run. I wasn't running. I was helping people. And almost everybody I helped -- the governor of Ohio, he's great; the governor of Georgia, he's great; the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, he's great; Oklahoma -- -- I mean, so many different places.
Every place, we have such tremendous -- and, remember, they were going to take over the Senate and House? Well, there's so many people in the House, but the ones -- like in Kentucky, Andy Barr -- the ones that we helped -- the ones that I went to -- won. They won their races against very tough competition.
But we held the Senate and picked up two seats, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. And if we didn't, we wouldn't be having judges, but nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to do is say, ""Oh, they lost House seats."" Well, you know, there's a lot of people running in the House.
And what I did is I campaigned for senators and we almost picked up another three. We came very close to big upsets. so I actually think we have the energy. And I'm going to be running, and it's going to make a big difference. We're going to win a lot of things that people have no idea. Like, for instance, in the audience the other night -- so many women for Trump.
So many. So many. But they did the same thing. They did the same thing -- . They did the same thing in 2016. ""Women -- they'll not vote for Trump. They're not going to vote."" I was saying to my wife, ""Do you think women are going to vote for me at all?"" And we got a tremen- -- I mean, the women came out and it was incredible what happened against Hillary Clinton -- a wonderful woman, wonderful person -- -- who dubbed us all the ""deplorables."" She actually said two words, you know.
You know the other word? She said ""deplorables"" and ""irredeemables."" And I thought the word ""irredeemable"" was going to catch on. Shows you what I thought. Because I think irredeemable is worse than deplorable, right? Wouldn't you say, Bill? Give me a definition. Isn't it worse? But the next day, I made a speech -- I'll never forget, she used it -- you know, I didn't think too much about it. The next day, I'm in this big stadium making a speech, and I see: ""We're the deplorables."" ""We love you."" I'm saying, ""What did that come from?"" See?
That's why politics is a tough business. One word can put you right out of business, right? One word. That was not a good speech she made. I don't know who wrote it, but I don't think she'd ever want to use them again. ""They're deplorables.
You're activists. Be an activist. They are activists. What they do is so terrible. Be activists. That's okay. There's nothing wrong with it. And the believers across our country, they strengthen our communities in countless ways -- so many ways. That's why we're empowering Americans of faith to live by the Lord's calling to love their neighbors.
We've created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, from South Carolina, who's been a great guy. Great guy. He came in with this idea, and now nobody had anybody idea it was going to work like this. There's never been anything that worked like this. It's incredible what's going with Opportunity Zones -- brand new -- which give churches and investors more ways to rebuild distressed communities.
And last year, with the help of many faith leaders, I signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. And, if you remember, Sleepy Joe Biden -- he's the one -- he was pushing it. And that was a killer for Hillary Clinton. And I remember, the first time I saw people -- real activists -- against Hillary because of her husband and what they did on criminal justice reform, and they did nothing to fix it. What they did -- it was terrible: the Crime Act.
What they did was terrible to so many people. And we got criminal justice reform passed with very conservative people and very liberal people. I mean, it was an amazing thing. But nobody until -- that was done four months ago -- nobody until this time thought it could ever happen. And you had to see the people that were in favor of it -- the most conservative people, some of the most conservative -- even more conservative than Bill Bennett, which is hard to believe.
Am I right? I mean, seriously conservative. And also, very liberal people. It was a great thing. It was a great thing. We're glad to be joined today by the first person released from prison under the First Step Act -- Matthew Charles. Where's Matthew? Thank you, Matthew. That was very unfair what happened to Matthew and many other people -- many other people.
And we're very tough on crime, but what happened to some people was very unfair. So it's really great that you're here, Matthew, and I hear you're doing phenomenally well, and we appreciate it. What a great, great person you are.
Thank you, Natalie. It's just -- it was an incredible thing. I saw the picture of Natalie. She was in a wheelchair. She was in a bed. And they showed them, and it was so incredible. And they were, actually, preparing her for death. And because of Right to Try, they had a medicine that wouldn't have been approved for years, but it was very, very -- it's looking good.
It was looking very good. Now it's looking a lot better, Natalie, I have to tell you. I don't know what that was, but that sucker worked, Natalie. You know, part of the problem with Right to Try is that the big pharmaceutical companies and the labs -- they didn't want to do it because they didn't want have where a person is terminally ill or very in bad shape.
They didn't want to have that on their record. I understood that. And so we didn't put it on their record. We made a second, you know, record, which people don't see and we don't want to show. You know, it's unfair to them. But they didn't want it to go on their record because people were very far along, unfortunately.
But cases like Natalie have not even been that unique. We've saved many lives with what's going on. And ultimately, I guess, that's probably also the best test for a medicine to see whether or not it's good, because it really -- it's worked so well and we're so proud of it. They've been trying to get that approved for 45 years.
They couldn't get it done. Not that easy, because the medicals didn't want it; the doctors didn't want it; the country didn't want it. Our country -- because they say, ""Well, if something happens and a person is terminally ill, then they die, then we'll get sued if we do something."" I said, ""That's okay.
They'll sign an exculpatory letter. They'll sign a letter saying that we're not going to hold anybody liable."" That's okay. And they said, ""Well, that's a good idea."" Can you imagine? Forty-five years, nobody thought of that. Obviously, they're not in the real estate business in New York. And we had great help from the Republicans.
And we actually had some Democrat support. And we got it done. And, to me, I thought that was going to be so easy. And I just want to say that, Natalie, you are an inspiration. You really do -- you lit up that screen.
My wife watched; I said, ""You have to see this."" It's a great invention -- it's called TiVo, okay? I don't want to be advertising, but you know it's like, better than television, because television, you never see it again. With TiVo, you play it back. I played it back. I played it back. And my wife said, ""That is amazing."" So, we're very proud of you, Natalie.
Thank you very much. Incredible person. Incredible spirit. We want every American to have the chance to live and to dream and to thrive. And to protect the safety and wellbeing of our citizens, we're securing our border, building the wall -- it's being built right now. It could have been so easy -- the wall -- if they gave us the money, but they won't give us the money.
The Democrats won't give us the money. And I think it's more political, because who -- I mean, a wall works. Okay? They have drones. They want to give me unlimited money for drones, unlimited money for everything. You know, a drone, flying up in the air, doesn't help as 5,000 people are charging the border.
Unless you want to take nice pictures of what's happening. So we'll have almost four -- probably more than 400 miles built by the end of next year. It's under construction now. And I'm taking from here -- . We're all over the place. We're taking -- Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job, but we're building a lot of it. It's already started, and it's -- a lot of it's being done.
And it's -- it has such a tremendous difference. It's day and night. This year alone, 43,000 minors have been illegally smuggled across our border, providing a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations anywhere in the world. Loopholes and federal law prevent Homeland Security from removing illegal aliens who get smuggled into our country through bad laws.
It's our bad laws. And, by the way, Mexico -- they're really helping us. They just put 6,000 soldiers on the southern border -- their southern border. And they just announced they're going to put 16,000 soldiers on our southern border. And it's had a huge impact. It's only been a few days, literally, but it's had a huge impact.
And they were great. And I'm glad I didn't have to do tariffs on Mexico. I'm glad. I'm very glad. But we've been trying to get them to do that for 40 years -- more, they say -- for 40 years. And, you know, I'll tell you what, they stepped up. And, as I say, Mexico is doing more to help us than the Democrats, who are doing nothing.
Nothing. We have repeatedly asked the Democrats to close these loopholes and to save the lives of young immigrants. I mean, they're too busy interviewing people on the Russian witch hunt, on the hoax. If they spent a little bit less time on the Russian witch hunt -- which turned out to be a total phony deal.
Actually, they're the ones that committed the crime, as it turned out. If they spent some time on that, they could solve the loophole problem in an hour, they could solve the asylum problem in an hour, and we'd have no problem whatsoever at the border. They don't want to do it. They want things to look bad, they want open borders.
Open borders mean crime, means human trafficking. Human trafficking -- mostly women. Okay? Human trafficking. This is like prehistoric -- a word like that, ""trafficking."" Who would think? There's more human trafficking in the world today than there ever has been in history. Who would think that? You think of it almost as an ancient term; it's not.
Because of the Internet, all over the world, it's happening. Mostly women. And the Democrats don't want to fix it. Someday, you'll explain this to me. And I actually think, even from the strictly political point of view, I think it's a terrible thing for them. I hope they -- you know, actually, I want them to fix it. I really do. But if they keep going on this path, who the hell would want to vote for them?
. And, frankly, coupled with Mexico and what Mexico is doing now on stopping people from coming through Mexico, you would have a border that would be better than it's ever been. And we'll be there pretty soon in any event.
And as the wall goes up, every area that we build, we pick the worst areas first. But it makes a tremendous difference. Democrats who refuse to close these smuggling loopholes are effectively supporting and promoting child endangerment and exploitation, and they're making some very, very bad people -- the cartel people -- rich.
Very rich. People are saying they're making as much money or more money with people now as they do with drugs. These are rough people and they're bad people, and we could solve this so easily. They've got to fix the loopholes and fix asylum. The tragedy playing out on our border is the predictable result of Democrats' twisted obsession with open borders policy.
They want open borders. You saw these massive caravans of ten and twelve thousand people; fifteen thousand people, in one case. And in those caravans are some very good people, but also in those caravans are some very, very bad people. And they're probably put there by the countries who want to get rid of them, probably.
I don't say that, but we were paying those countries $600 million a year, and I cut it off about seven or eight months ago. I said, ""Look, they can stop these caravans."" And then I took a lot of heat from Democrats that said, ""We want to pay them."" Well, maybe if they get it right, but they're doing better for us right now.
If you look -- Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador -- they're doing much better for us right now. We're close to a safe third agreement with Guatemala, which we appreciate. They're doing much better for us now than when we paid them. When we paid them, they were just taking our money and laughing at us. Now they want to -- they'll do anything to get that money back.
And if they do a great job, I think we'll maybe do that, right? Does that make sense? But $600 million a year we were paying, and we were getting nothing but disrespect. And this was for many, many years. Now I took it away, and, honestly, they've been, I think, much different. But they would put bad people in those caravans.
They don't want killers. They don't want murderers. They don't want people that are criminals. ""So let's send them to the United States."" And they're not doing that anymore. And we're doing some very strong work. And, again, with Mexico having 6,000 soldiers at that border, that's a tremendous deterrent, I can tell you.
Democrats are solely responsible for the humanitarian crisis because they've refused every single effort to shut off the magnets of child smuggling -- hard to believe. As long as coyotes believe they can use children to evade our laws, children will continue to be endangered. When you come in with a child, our laws are so bad that you have a tremendous advantage.
So you get these people and they give them children and they charge them for it. They walk in with a child that isn't their child. And because the Democrats have these horrible laws that were horrible many years ago, that they should've fixed a long time ago, but they don't want to do it for political reasons.
But think of it: If you have a child, it's much easier to come in. And that's why we have so many children who have been so badly abused. And we're taking care of them much better than President Obama took care of them, I can tell you that. Much better. And he was the one that had separation. I'm the one that put people together.
And I said, ""You know, when you put the families together…"" -- because separation is so bad -- ""…a lot more people are going to come up."" And I was right about that. But still, the whole concept of separation is so bad. But again, fixing the laws would solve everything. And they could do it so quickly. It's so simple.
They know what to do; they just don't want to do it. If the Democrats have any shred of moral decency on this issue, they must charge -- immediately charge forward and change our laws. They have to end all child smuggling. We have laws -- it would end all of this horrible child smuggling. How do we have thousands upon thousands of children?
We have them because the law incentivizes criminals to bring children up and use those criminals to get people into our country. Can you even imagine this? And we're the only country in the world that has this. The only country in the world. And we want to put behind bars those criminals that place children in this kind of danger.
Every day, Democrats obstruct these changes. They fight like hell so that we can't make the changes. Every day, they leave laws and trafficking victims and -- You know, we have a very, very tough rule, law: Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. They leave it in place. More migrants are put in harm's way and exposed to abuse and assault by criminal cartels.
They could fix that so easy. It would take no time. This lesson can be seen all over the world, where the rule of law is eroded -- where it is eroded. The Democrats -- even when we had both Houses -- where we had Congress, where we had the Senate and we had wonderful congressmen -- we had the House of Representatives and the Senate, but we didn't have enough votes because it was very close.
We needed 60 votes, and we had 51 votes. And sometimes, you know, we had a little hard time with a couple of them, right? Fortunately, they're gone now. They've gone on to greener pastures. Or perhaps, far less green pastures, but they're gone. They're gone, Bill. Very happy they're gone. And we have great senators, but we need 60. We have 53 right now and we had 51. We picked up two in the '18 election, but we need 60. So we need Democrat votes; it's very simple.
And we needed them before, too. We needed them even more so before, when we had both the House and the Senate. So where the door is open to smugglers and traffickers, disaster always ensues. Nonetheless, Democrats remain relentless in pushing policies to add even more incentives to the unlawful transportation of illegal alien minors across our borders.
You have no idea how bad it is, and it could be fixed instantaneously by the Democrats sitting down with the Republicans. The Republicans are all in favor of it -- virtually unanimous. I would say ""unanimous."" We could fix instant- -- we just need a few votes. We don't need many; we need a few. But they don't want to do it. And, you know, one thing I've learned in Washington -- I've heard about it for years: The Democrats have lousy policies and, in many ways, they're lousy politicians, but they stick together better than the Republicans stick together.
They stick together. They vote in a group. You don't see them going haywire. They may have a plan that's bad like this -- open borders. They want open borders. They stick. You don't have people going the other way and voting, and going out and making speeches about how we're wrong. They stick together. We have better politicians, we have far better policy, but the Democrats do stick together.
And, frankly, I give them credit for that, but it's bad for our country. It's very bad for our country. So let me state clearly: My administration will not tolerate -- and just, we can't do this; we can't do it -- we cannot tolerate the endangerment, abuse, or smuggling of children. And the only way to really stop it is to change the law, and the Democrats can do that immediately.
We will stand strong with the courageous heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and law enforcement. These are fantastic people. They want to get rid of ICE. ICE is so -- these are great patriots. These are great people, but they're also tough. Shaun can tell you about that. You need toughness at a certain point, Shaun, right?
You need physically tough -- strong, tough. These are great people. Shaun is a great person, but he's tough. It's okay. We need strong people. We need tough people. ICE goes into these areas where you have MS-13. And to them, it's like a day in the office. And they'll walk into the middle of a gang and they start swinging.
I don't think I'd want to do it. I don't think too many people want to do it. But these are brave people, and they're great people, and they love our country. And you have some congressmen, in particular -- but also some Democrats there -- they want to get rid of ICE. I'll tell you what: You get rid of ICE, you're going to have problems, because we take MS-13 out of our country by the thousands.
We take other gang members out and drop them back either into jails -- which, in a way, I hate to do because then we have to pay for them for 30 years. I hate to do it. But we bring them back to their countries and say, ""You handle them."" The problem is that, all of a sudden, two years later, you see them again because our laws are so screwed up. To protect our nation, we're also rebuilding the United States Armed Forces like never, ever before.
Lindsey Graham said last night -- he made a speech and he said last night that he's been a senator for a long time. He's been in politics for a long time. He's always been very strong on the military. He's never seen our military so strong as it is today. Great statement. And I know it hurts our budgets -- and budgets are very important to me -- but there's nothing more important than keeping our freedom.
And this is a time where we need military. More important than anything else, we need military. We'll worry about budgets. We spent -- we spent $716 billion last year, and $700 billion the year before. And we have brand new fighter jets. We had jets that were so old, they didn't fly. We had jets so old, they had to go to the desert to the ""airplane graveyards,"" they call them.
They have graveyards of old planes. They had to go there to get parts. Now, we have brand new, beautiful F-35s, F-18s. Best planes in the world. And they're all made in the USA, right? We like that. Made in the USA. And as was stated a few times, because I've seen it and heard it so much here, but I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Thank you. Thank you. Every President said they were going to do it. You go back many, many Presidents -- they said they were going to do it; they never did it. They never did it. And I understand why, because the pressure put on you -- once you get into office -- not to do it by other countries is amazing.
I got so many calls. And I knew they heard I was going to do it in two weeks. I got so many calls from the heads of countries. So when I knew they were calling about that, I'd say, ""Tell them I'll call them back in a week and a half. I'm very busy."" Because it's hard to tell, you know, a king, ""No."" They'd never heard ""no"" before.
So, you know, I don't mind telling them no, but what do I have to waste my time for, right? But I see why that other people -- that they just didn't do it. They campaigned, ""I will recognize…"" -- all of them. And they didn't do it. And they didn't do it. They didn't come through. This is many, many Presidents.
Not just President Obama. He campaigned on it, too; never did it. Bush campaigned on it. Clinton campaigned on it. Everybody did. They didn't do it. And I did it. But what I did with the calls -- I'll explain this just to this first row of young geniuses from Liberty University. What I did is I didn't take the calls.
And then after, I signed the document, had a press conference, announced it. And now Jerusalem becomes the capital of Israel. It's a big thing, right? After I did it, I probably had 25 calls from leaders of countries who were going to say, ""Please don't do it."" I called them back, ""Hey, what's up? What's going on?"" ""What's up?"" And they said, ""Sir, we were going to ask you not to do the embassy in Jerusalem, if that were possible, but you did it yesterday."" And, this year, we recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
That was another big thing. That's been 52 years in the making. Many, many summits -- they had many, many summits. People would fly in with their big jets from all these countries -- these big, beautiful jets. They'd land, they'd talk about the Golan Heights for two days, and then they'd fly out. Nothing would happen.
I did it. First time. And maybe most importantly or very importantly, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. Remember when they signed that deal? They were all screaming, ""Death to USA! Death to the United States!"" They were screaming as we're signing a deal. Whoever signs a deal when they're screaming ""Death to the USA""? You got John Kerry, the world's worst negotiator -- -- who, by the way, has totally violated the Logan Act, okay?
You know, he's talking to them all the time, telling them what to do. ""Gee, don't do it, you're going to make me look bad if you do it."" Don't make a deal. ""Wait, Trump!"" He probably says, ""Wait him out! Maybe he'll lose the election."" How about that? We have a long way to go. Fifteen months, right? And you have a guy saying, ""Wait him out.
Maybe he'll lose the election."" That's against the law. It's against the law. He can't do that. I'm supposed to be doing a good job. I'll tell you what: If it weren't for him, I really think they would've already been in negotiations with us, maybe even had a deal. But maybe that won't happen. And if it doesn't happen, that's fine with me. I have unlimited time, as far as I'm concerned.
But that was a disastrous deal. ""Death to America. Death to Israel."" Remember? They're signing it. Kerry is signing. They're screaming, ""Death to Israel! Death to America!"" We've imposed the toughest-ever sanctions on Iran, and we added more this week. My administration is also speaking out against religious persecution all around the world.
We believe that every community has the right to worship in peace. In Latin America, we support the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. A lot of progress, too. In America, we reject the failed socialist ideology of government domination. You'll end up with another Venezuela right here, and it won't take long.
Our rights don't come from politicians; they come from the Creator. America was not built by bureaucrats, America was built by innovators and entrepreneurs, pioneers, and pastors, and ministers, and priests, and families, and factory workers, and rabbis, and dreamers, and doers. Our destiny is not written in Washington, it's written in our hearts.
We know that faith and prayer, not federal regulation, defines the moral character of our country. We know that. We know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create strong and loving communities. That's why I want our pastors and our clergy telling us what they think. I want to hear from them.
I don't want them to be held up in making a statement. I want to hear from those people. Those are the people you want most to hear from -- perhaps even more so than your President. But maybe not. I don't know. You tell me. But I want to hear from them. I don't want them to be hurt or harmed or taxed because they're giving their views.
Those are the views I want to hear. Above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government; we worship God. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We've got your back. Got your back. You came out like no movement in history. There's never been a movement like happened in 2016. Never happened before to that extent, and there's never been a movement like that.
. I could ask somebody like Bill Bennett. I mean, there's never been -- there's never been a -- an election like this. And even now, we still fight and fight and fight. They just refuse to accept, but we're winning the fight, and it's a very important fight.
And the election coming up is, in certain ways, maybe going to be as important -- I can't say more important, but as important as the election of 2016. In certain ways, it could be more important. I mean, it really could, because it could all go down very quickly. I mean, you have to be very, very careful.
Bill, I don't think there's ever been anything like happened in 2016. What do you think?
I really -- you know, I believe it. I just -- not because of me; it's just a movement that nobody has ever seen anything like it, anywhere. All over the world, they talk about it. Everyone here today is united by the same tireless values: the dignity of work, the miracle of life, and the blessings of freedom.
Every day of my presidency, we fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise our children, protect our communities, and make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth. And today, I honestly believe it's greater than it's ever been before. And I also think, very importantly, that we have more potential than we've ever had before.
That's a very important thing. We haven't stopped. We have more potential. Do you know: If the stock market just sort of goes out nice and easy, some of the stats will be the greatest, the most successful June in over 80 years? Think of that. Over 80 years. And if it goes up a little bit more, it could even break the all-time record.
But 80 years is not so bad. The choice of our future has never been clearer. The radical left offers a vision of socialism, censorship, high taxes, open borders and extreme late-term abortion. Our movement is about lifting up all Americans. We're fighting for the American worker, we're fighting for the American family, and we're fighting for the American Dream.
With your help, our nation will prosper in the fullness of faith and the glory of liberty. Our families will be strong. Our children will be free. Our country will be safe. And America will forever remain one proud nation, under God. Together, with the love, the prayers, and devotion of everyone in this room, and the millions and millions of patriots all across our land, we will make America great again for all Americans --- greater than ever before.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
",Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Washington,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-faith-freedom-coalition-june-26-2019
Herbert Hoover,United States of America,1932-10-28 00:00:00,"My fellow citizens, my friends in Indianapolis, and may I also include Senator Watson, for I wish to add that he must be your next Senator--we require his services in Washington:
Now, my fellow citizens, my major purpose tonight is to discuss those long-view policies by which we not only cement recovery but also by which we secure over the years the enlarged comfort and the steady progress of the American people. I propose to contrast them with the ideas which have been developed by the Democratic House of Representatives, the Democratic platform, and the Democratic candidate in the course of this campaign.
When I refer to the views of these groups I wish to say at once that I do not refer to all members of the Democratic Party. Many of them, as in 1896 and in 1928, have signified their intention to support us against these notions. I also wish on all occasions to pay tribute to those Democratic Members of the Congress who supported the unprecedented measures which we presented during the course of the last winter and through which we saved this country from destruction and chaos.
I would like also to reiterate the statement which I recently made at Detroit, that the most important issue before the American people right now is to overcome this crisis, that we may secure a restoration of normal jobs to our unemployed, recovery of our agricultural prices and of our business, and that we may extend generous help in the meantime to tide our people over until these fundamental restorations are established.
I pointed out on that occasion that the battle has now changed from a successful defense of our country from disaster and chaos to forward marching attack on a hundred fronts through a score of instrumentalities and weapons toward recovery. Since that time I have had further positive evidence showing that the measures and policies that we have set in motion are driving the forces of depression into further retreat with constantly increasing rapidity. If there shall be no change in the strategy of this battle, if there shall be no delay and hesitation, we shall have the restoration of men and women to their normal jobs and we shall have that lift to agriculture from its anxieties and its losses.
But before I begin the major discussion of the evening, I wish to take a moment of your time to revert to those methods and policies for protection and recovery from this depression in the light of certain recent misstatements of the Democratic candidate in respect to them.
I presume the Governor of New York will announce that I am acting upon the defensive if I shall expose the self-interested inexactitude which he has broadcasted to the American people. I am equally prepared to defend, attack, or expound. I shall not be deterred from my purpose to lay before the people of the United States the truth as to the issues which they confront, and I shall do it with a sense of responsibility of one who has carried out and must carry into effect these issues.
I wish to call your attention to the fact that the Governor of New York in a speech on October 25 stated:
""This crash came in October 1929. The President had at his disposal all of the instrumentalities of the Government. From that day until December 31, 1931, he did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation. Not only did he do nothing, but he took the position that Congress could do nothing.""
That is the end of the quotation, and it is a charge which extends over the first 2 years and 2 months of this depression. It seems almost incredible that a man, a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, would broadcast such a violation of the truth. The front pages of every newspaper in the United States for the whole of those 2 years proclaimed the untruth of that statement. And I need remind you but of a few acts of the administration to demonstrate what I say.
The Governor dismisses the agreements brought about between the leaders of industry and labor under my assistance less than 1 month after the crash by which wages of literally millions of men and women were, for the first time in 15 depressions of a century, held without reduction until after profits had ceased and the cost of living had decreased.
He ignores the fact that today real wages in the United States are higher than at any other depression period, higher in purchasing power than in any other country in the world. And above all, he dismisses the healing effect of that great agreement by which this country has been kept free from industrial strife and class conflicts.
He would suppress from the American people the knowledge of the undertaking brought about within 2 months after the crash amongst the industries of the United States to divide the existing work in such fashion as to give millions of families some measure of income instead of discharging a large portion of them into destitution, as had always been the case in previous depressions and was the case abroad. He ignores the fact that these agreements have held until this day for the staggering unemployment.
If the Governor will look up his own files of his official correspondence, he will find that within a month after the crash I appealed to him, amongst the other Governors, for cooperation in creating employment and stabilization of wages, in which I set out to him the gravity of the national situation and urged that he should present in turn the great need to the counties and cities of his State. If he says nothing was done, it was a violation of the promise which he wrote to me on that occasion.
Nevertheless, the other States and the municipalities, including the great State of Indiana, entered into the general definite organization between the States to increase construction work in relief of unemployment during the winters not only of 1930 but of 1931. Not only were Federal, State, and municipal agencies mobilized, but private agencies were mobilized to that end. And by this, the Governor seems to have forgotten, I succeeded in reversing the whole usual process of decreasing construction work of this character in time of depression.
This type of work was increased during the first year of the depression by over $800 million above normal, thus giving a living to thousands of families who otherwise would have been destitute.
The Governor says nothing had been done. The Governor would also suppress the fact of the mobilization of the American people under my direction during the winters of 1930 and '31 of private charity and of public support to relief of distress in every town, village, and hamlet in the United States through which we carried them over these winters without serious suffering or loss, as is proved by the public health statistics of today.
The Governor cannot be ignorant of the recommendations which I made to the Congress within a month after the crash, and again in the session a year later, for the great increase of Federal public works in aid of employment, and he cannot be ignorant of the appropriations made at my recommendation for the care of farmers stricken by drought or the public funds raised under my leadership for these purposes.
The Governor ignores the most patent fact in the history of this depression: that, under the wise policies pursued by this administration, recovery of the United States from the first phase of the depression-that is, the collapse from our own speculation and boom--began about a year after the crash and continued definitely and positively until April 1931, when the general world crash took place which was not of our doing.
The Governor is probably ignorant of the international measures taken to limit the extension of this prairie fire under American leadership. He ignores the German moratorium and the standstill agreements in June 1931, which not only saved Germany from complete collapse but prevented much of the extended distress from reaching the United States. He neglects the creation, after the collapse of England, of the National Credit Corporation with a capital of $500 million in cooperation amongst American banks, which saved over 700 institutions involving the deposits of upwards of 10 millions of our people, and that was doing something.
The Governor entirely misrepresents the fact that the plan to meet this crisis which swept upon us from Europe was proposed by me to the political leaders of the United States at a White House conference on October 6, 1931. He ignores the fact that that plan was laid before the Congress by a message on December 8, and that it was not the creation of the Democratic leaders at the end of December, as he would imply. Although the leaders of the Democratic Party had promised 14 months before they would produce a plan, they produced no plan until they began their destructive program some months later. And not one of those acts has been disavowed by the Governor. He ignores the fact that the unprecedented measures proposed and carried through by the administration with the help of some of the Democratic colleagues in the Congress would have put us on the road to recovery 8 months ago instead of having had to await the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives only 4 months ago.
And again the Governor, despite every proof, keeps reiterating the implication that the measures taken by this administration have had no fruitful result to the common man. He has been told, at least by some of the men who advise him in this campaign, that the gigantic crisis with which the United States was faced was escaped by the narrowest margins and that it was due to unprecedented measures adopted by this administration. If some of these men will tell him the whole truth, they will tell him that they personally sought to buy and withdraw large sums of gold because of their belief that we could not maintain the gold reserves of the United States.
Would it not be well that every American citizen should take pride in the fact that America carried this Nation through this crisis safely and soundly and did it as a matter of national and united action?
Why cannot the Governor of New York be frank enough to recognize the successful care of the distressed in the United States; that a vast amount of employment has been provided by cooperative action amongst our citizens; that the savings of more than 95 percent of the depositors in our banks have been held secure; that the 20 million borrowers who otherwise would have been bankrupt by destructive pressures from forced selling of their assets in order to pay their debts have been protected; that the 70 million life insurance policies which represent the greatest act of self-denial of a people in provision for the future safety of their loved ones have been sustained in their vitality; and foreclosure of hundreds of thousands of mortgages upon homes and farms has been prevented ? Those are national accomplishments for which the whole American people are proud.
The Governor knows that the integrity of our currency has been sustained, that the credit of the Federal Government has been maintained, that credit and employment are being expanded day by day.
The living proof of these measures, which were conceived from the human heart as well as the human mind, can be found in the men and women in every city, every town, every township, and every block in this broad land, for they have been saved their jobs and their homes and secured from suffering and that by the action of the American people as a whole.
I have stated that my major purpose this evening is to speak upon some of the continuing policies of this administration and the Republican Party in contrast with the policies of our opponents.
Many of these continuing policies are dealt with in our platform. I dealt with some of them in my acceptance speech. Some have developed in the course of this campaign. Having had the responsibility of this office for 30 years, my views upon most public questions are already set out in many cases in the public record and by definite public action. I do not have to engage in promises in respect to them. I may point to performance.
The opposition has shown its true purposes by its legislation in the last session of the Democratic House of Representatives, through their platform, and through the statements or evasions of their candidate.
Of these subjects I may first refer to the tariff.
In a recent speech, in discussing the agricultural tariffs, I pointed out the specific disaster to our farms from the Democratic proposal to reduce the protective tariff. I pointed out that the Democratic Party had, in 1913, not been content with merely lowering the tariff, but had put a large part of the farm products on the free list. I pointed out that the Republican Party had passed an emergency farm tariff bill in 1921, as soon as they had a majority in the Congress, and that a Democratic President had vetoed it. I pointed out that the Democratic minority in Congress, in 1921, had voted against the revival of the emergency farm tariff, and that the Republican majority had passed it, and a Republican President had signed it. I pointed out that the Democratic minority had voted against an increase in agricultural tariffs in the Republican tariff act of 1922. I pointed out that most of the Democratic Members of Congress voted against the bill carrying the increases in tariffs on agricultural products in the special session of Congress which I called in 1929 for that purpose on which occasion we passed the Hawley-Smoot bill.
In the light of this historic attitude it is but natural that our opponents express their bitter opposition to the Republican tariff. They have habitually voted against these tariffs. And now they propose in their platform a ""competitive tariff for revenue,"" and they denounce the Smoot-Haw ley bill which is mainly devoted to the increase of farm tariffs. The Democratic candidate from the day of his nomination iterated and reiterated that he proposed to reduce the tariff. He stated that it was an unwarranted increase in the tariff.
During the first 7 weeks of this campaign he not only adopted the historic position of his party, but he constantly repeats their platform, and has reinforced it by repeated statements, as for instance:
""I support the competitive tariff for revenue.""
""The tariff law of 1932 was a drastic revision of the tariff upward in spite of the fact that the existing tariff levels were already high enough to protect American industries.""
""We sit on the high wall of the Hawley-Smoot tariff.""
""I condemn the Hawley-Smoot tariff.""
""A wicked and exorbitant tariff.""
""Sealed by the highest tariff in the history of the world.""
""Our policy declares for lowered tariffs.""
""A ghastly jest of the tariff.""
Mr. Roosevelt and his party knew that the major increases in the Hawley-Smoot act were farm tariffs when that platform was drawn, and he knew it was in effect when he made the statements that I have quoted. The evidence is complete that he and they intend to reduce the farm tariffs.
During the past 3 weeks I have reiterated this plain and evident purpose of their party and their candidate. Unquestionably my exposition has given their candidate great anxiety, because on the 25th of this month some 6 or 7 days ago, just 21 days after my first statement on the subject he announced another new deal. I call this a new shuffle. He now announces within 2 weeks of the election that he does not propose to reduce tariffs on farm products.
This is the most startling shift in position by a Presidential candidate: in the midst of a political campaign in all recent political history. What do you think Grover Cleveland or Samuel Tilden or Woodrow Wilson would have said to such a shift as that? Does the candidate realize that he has overnight thrown overboard the great historic position of his party? That he has rewritten the Democratic platform? Does he realize that he must withdraw large parts of the speeches in which he has denounced this Hawley-Smoot bill as the origin of all the world's calamity?
I have the privilege of informing him that 66 percent of all the duties collected on all of the imports into the United States are directly on imports of agricultural origin and the reduction of which would affect American farmers.
Are we to take it that all the diatribes we have heard from the Democratic orators throughout this campaign are in respect to only one-third of the American tariffs? For just 7 days ago the Democratic candidate said, ""The Hawley-Smoot tariff law carried the decline in world trade, and what amounted to a world calamity became a general international calamity."" Since that time he must have concluded that the farm tariffs have done the world no harm.
You will further remember that under the tariff act two-thirds of our imports are free of duty, and now he excludes two-thirds of the remaining one-third that are dutiable. Does the Democratic Party now pretend that this terrible world calamity which we have encountered was caused by the tariffs on one-ninth of the imports into the United States ? And further, do they know--and they do know--that of this one-ninth of the imports of nonagricultural commodities less than one-half of them were increased by the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill?
Now to continue our mathematical explorations a little further, I'm wondering if they pretend that this calamity was caused by increase of tariffs on one-eighteenth of the imports of the United States ? And I may pursue this mathematical course still further. Do they recognize that the whole of our imports, that is, the imports of the United States, constitute less than 12 percent of the imports of the world all taken together, and thus, in this revised view, the increased duties on one-eighteenth of one-twelfth or less than one-half of 1 percent of the world's import trade brought about this gigantic calamity by which 30 nations failed or gone to revolution.
Should not the Democratic candidate now at last search in the aftermath of the World War for the origins of our difficulties and stop this nonsense?
I wish to extend this discussion a little further. It is desirable that the Governor may explain himself some further on other tariff questions. Does he include the reduction of the tariff on cotton textiles, so largely manufactured in the South ? I have included but a part of the textile duties in the agricultural tariffs--the tariffs on agricultural products-inasmuch as only a part of the raw cotton is dutiable. And I wonder whether he proposes to close up the Southern cotton mills?
In view of this new light of maintaining tariffs, I wonder if he has considered the grievous position that the oil industry might be in in the States of California, Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas, if they are left out ? Has he considered the copper industry in the States of Arizona, Montana, Michigan, and Utah? Has he considered the tariffs on metal and other products which affect the welfare of the whole of the people of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, West Virginia, and other States ? Has he considered the tariff on pottery and chemicals and its effect upon New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, California, and a lot of other States? And will he consider the tariffs on lumber and their effect on Oregon, Washington, California, and Wisconsin? If we are going to retreat from a reduction of the tariff those people ought to have some word of comfort also.
Perhaps if he would give the same consideration as to the effect of reducing the tariff for these other people, he will come to the same conclusion as that which he has been forced to come by this debate in respect to agriculture. Now, if political exigencies have forced this temporary conversion on agricultural products, how far is the Governor authorized to change at will the traditional policies and the platform of the Democratic Party ? How far can he guarantee to bring with him the Democratic Members of the House and the Senate who voted against the bills carrying the increases in agricultural tariffs, and how about the men who wrote that plank in the Democratic platform ? Now do you who are farmers believe in eleventh-hour conversion? Do you consider that your livelihood is safe in the hands of the traditional and the present enemy of the protective tariff?
Perhaps the Governor and the whole Democratic Party will now withdraw and apologize for the defamation to which I have been subjected for the past 2 years because I called a special session of the Congress and secured an increase in agricultural tariffs.
Now I am, myself, taking heart over this debate. If it could be continued long enough, I believe we could drive him from every solitary position he has taken in this campaign. They are equally untenable. But even on the tariff, he perhaps remembers the dreadful experience of the chameleon on the Scotch plaid. And I can illustrate this to you.
As to the balance of the protective tariffs, unless this late conversion extends further than agriculture, he proposes to reduce them in the face of the fact that during the last 12 months there has been a violent change in the economy of the entire world through the depreciation of currencies in some 30 European nations and thus a lowering of their standards of living and the creation of still greater differences between the costs of production in the United States and abroad.
Now, the Republican Party is squarely for the protective tariff. I refuse to put the American workers and farmers into further unemployment and misery by any such action as the unrepented principles of their Members of the Democratic Congress and their platform.
The Governor's new shuffle, however, requires that he give some further assurances to our farmers in order to make it consistent. The Democratic House of Representatives and their allies in the Senate passed a bill directing me to call an international conference for the purpose of reducing tariffs. The Governor has supported this in his program. That means that we should surrender to foreigners the determination of a policy which we have zealously held under American control for nearly 150 years, ever since the first protective tariff was enacted under George Washington's administration. This would, in that manner, place the fate of American workers and American farmers in the hands of foreign nations, and I vetoed the bill.
But the point that I wish to make now is that the Governor should give to the farmers that if he calls this conference which he has assured he will do, that he will exempt agricultural tariffs from the discussion therein.
Further than this the Democratic Party and their candidate propose to enter upon reciprocal tariffs. That idea is not entirely new in our history, although it is a violation of what has now become a firmly fixed principle of uniform and equal treatment of all nations without preferences, concessions, or discriminations. It is just such concessions and discriminations that are producing today a large part of the frictions over tariffs in Europe. I suppose our Democratic friends blame these European tariff wars on the Hawley-Smoot bill.
Though reciprocal tariffs are a violation of well-established American principles, this Nation has fallen from grace at times and attempted to do this very thing. At one time 22 such treaties were negotiated for this purpose. Congress refused to confirm 16 of them; 2 of the remaining failed of confirmation by other governments; and 4 others were so immaterial as to be forgotten. On another occasion Congress conferred on the Executive a limited authority to make treaties of this character. Twenty-two of them were agreed upon, all of which were repealed by tariff acts. Now this demonstrates just one thing: that in an intelligent democracy you cannot surrender the welfare of one industry or one locality in order to gain something for another.
But there is an overriding objection to a reciprocal tariff upon which the Governor's new shuffle requires that he give these further assurances to the farmers. The vast majority of the wishes of foreign countries about our tariffs is to get us to reduce our farm tariffs so that they may enter our agricultural market. The only concessions that we could grant through reciprocal tariffs of any great importance would be at the cost of our farmers. Since the Governor has assured the Nation of a policy of reciprocal tariffs, he should give an assurance to the farmers that the farm tariffs will not be included and that he will abandon the whole idea of reciprocal tariffs in relation to agriculture. This, of course, takes away the whole foundation of the trading value in reciprocal tariffs. And we may as well abandon the further discussion of that in this campaign.
In all this discussion about reducing tariffs it should be remembered that if any one of the rates or schedules in our tariff is too high, it has been open to our opponents during the whole of the last session of the House of Representatives to pass a simple resolution and thereby secure its review by the Tariff Commission. Did they do that ? They did not.
The establishment of the Tariff Commission with this authority destroyed one of the campaign methods of the Democratic Party, and that was to conduct their campaigns by exhibiting kettles and pans to the housewives of the Nation and explaining what unjust cost was imposed upon them by the tariff. Now that maneuver is no longer effective, with the bipartisan Tariff Commission open to give remedy to the housewives of the United States.
The Democrats propose, in fact, passed a bill in the last session in the lower House, to destroy the authority of the bipartisan Tariff Commission by which it may change the tariff so as to correct inequities or to alter the schedules to meet the changing tides of an economic world. Thus, they propose to return to the old logrolling, the old orgies of greed, viciousness, and stagnation of business during general congressional action in review of the tariff.
The increased authority to the bipartisan Tariff Commission to make changes in the tariff with the approval of the President was brought about at my insistence, and with the sterling courage of your Senator, 2 years ago. That was the greatest reform in tariff legislation in half a century. And it originated from Theodore Roosevelt.
No better example of the vital importance of the flexible tariff exists than today, when we are in the crisis of men and women being thrown out of employment due to depreciated currencies abroad and of low-priced farm products moving over our borders. The commission is today reexamining the new differences in the cost of production at home and abroad that action may be taken to restore men and women to their jobs.
Sound public policy maintains the necessity of this Commission and its authorities. The Democratic policy is to destroy it, but perhaps the Governor of New York will offer us a new deal in this matter, also.
Now, related to the tariff, the Democratic candidate proposes to place the payment of the war debts owed to us by foreign countries squarely on the shoulders of the American workman and the American farmer by lowering the tariffs for this special purpose. He would let down the bars to the American market for foreign commodities to the extent necessary that foreign nations may collect from the profits of their manufactures the money with which to pay these debts. Will he now exclude the 66 percent of dutiable imports, which are farm products, from this proposal ?
My own view in opposition to cancellation of the war debts is a matter of public record through many public statements and messages to Congress. I have proposed that if opportunity offers we should use the foreign debts, payment by payment, to expand foreign markets for our labor and our own farmers. That is not cancellation and that is the reverse of the announced policy of the Democratic candidate.
At no point in this campaign have our opponents stated clearly and definitely their position on immigration. I have looked for it. I may have overlooked it. If I have I apologize. I have stated that I favor rigidly restricted immigration. I endeavored to secure from the Congress the return of the quota bases from the national origins to the base previously given. I have recommended that a more humane provision should be made for bringing in the near relatives of our citizens. I shall persist in these matters.
I have limited immigration by administrative order during the depression in order to relieve us of unemployment or, alternatively, to save the jobs of our people who are now at work. Two years prior to that order going into effect slightly under half a million immigrants came into the United States. Since it went into effect, more have gone out of the United States than have come in. The distressed people with lowered standards of living that would have come in would have been a far greater addition to our unemployed than even this amount. The Democratic candidate, incidentally, overlooked that little item in stating that the Republican administration had done nothing in the first 2 years and 2 months of this depression.
I have repeatedly recommended to the Congress a revision of our railway transportation laws in order that we might create greater stability and greater assurance in this vital service of transportation. The regulation should be extended to other forms of carriers, both to prevent the cutthroat destruction going on in their own business amongst themselves and to prevent their destruction of the other great major arm of our transportation. I have set this matter out in numerous messages to the Congress. I have supported the recommendations of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which are specific and not generalities. Our opponents have adopted my program in this matter during this campaign except for certain glittering generalizations, as to which they do not inform us how they are to be accomplished and upon which I enter a reservation.
I have repeatedly recommended the Federal regulation of interstate power. I stated as early as 7 years ago that ""glass pockets are the safety of the industry as well as of the public."" I secured the creation of an independent Power Commission by Congress 2 years ago under the leadership of your Senator. I have opposed and I will continue to oppose, the Federal Government going into the power business and the further extension of Federal bureaucracy.
The intention of many of the men at least that are campaigning for the Democratic Party and under the auspices of and with money provided by the Democratic National Committee, are certainly to put the Government into the power business, and it would seem that they must have confidence that their notions will be put over by the Democratic candidate.
The Democratic candidate assures us that he will preserve the great water powers of the country for the people. That is already provided by the law passed 20 years ago-passed in 1920--and it, therefore, presents no difficulty to vigorous campaign promises.
In my acceptance speech I stated that this depression had exposed many weaknesses in our economic system. It has shown much wrongdoing. There has been exploitation and abuse of financial power. These weaknesses must be corrected, and that wrongdoing must be punished. We will continue to reform such abuses and correct such wrongdoing as falls within the powers of the Federal Government.
Furthermore, the American people must have protection from insecure banking through a stronger banking system. They must have relief from conditions which permit the credit machinery of the country being made available without adequate check for wholesale speculation in securities, with its ruinous consequences to millions of our citizens and to our national economy. This the Federal Reserve System by its present constitution has proven incapable of bringing about. I recommended to the Congress the sane reform of our banking laws. The Democratic House of Representatives did not see fit to pass that legislation in the last session, but we shall persist until it has been accomplished.
About a year ago, I recommended to the Congress an emergency relief to our depositors in closed banks that through temporary use of the credit of the Federal Government a substantial portion of their assets should be forthwith distributed in order to relieve distress and to enable depositors to reestablish their business. The Democratic Congress refused to pass such legislation in the last session, except for a minor provision of authority to the Reconstruction Corporation which does not reach to the heart of the question.
The Democratic candidate and his corps of orators have not yet disclosed their position on this subject. It concerns the welfare of 4 or 5 million Americans.
We have listened to much prattle from the opposition about reducing Government expenses. Having a record of earnest performance, I naturally exposed those insincerities in the last address which I made at Detroit.
My only comment on this occasion is that if I receive a mandate from the American people in this election, I shall be able not only to force upon this Democratic House real economies, but I shall be able to stop further raids by the Democratic Party on the Treasury of the United States.
Now, through some misinformation presented to him, the Democratic candidate has annexed, as if it were a new discovery, the recommendations which I made in 1922 and have been continuously advocating ever since for the reorganization of the whole Federal administrative structure for purposes of economy by consolidation of bureaus and the elimination of useless boards and commissions. The candidate in a speech 3 days ago was thus led to misrepresent the present situation in suggesting that I, having these powers, had not executed them. He did not realize that the Congress having no longer been able to oppose this reform, did pass a measure during the last session granting such an authority to the Executive to bring it about. They, however, denied my request for immediate action, except on minor questions, and made that authority dependent upon the approval of the Congress, which cannot be given before next March under the terms of the law. If the Democratic candidate will read the law and inform himself fully on the subject I have no doubt he will withdraw that statement.
I recently gave an address at Des Moines devoted largely to specific measures now in action and to be put in action for agriculture.
I also, likewise at Cleveland, gave an extended exposition of the measures and policies which we have in action and propose for labor and employment. I am in hopes that these statements may be carefully considered, and our time is too short this evening to go into those items in detail although I hope to take them up again in this campaign.
One of the most important issues of the campaign arises from the fact that the Democratic candidate has not yet disavowed the bill passed by the Democratic House of Representatives under the leadership of the Democratic candidate for Vice President to issue $2,300 million of greenback currency--that is, unconvertible paper money. That is money purporting to come from the horn of plenty but with the death's head engraved upon it. Tampering with the currency has become a perennial policy of the Democratic Party. The Republican Party has had to repel that many times before now. In the absence of any declaration by the Democratic candidate on this subject during 7 weeks of this campaign, no delayed promise now can efface that policy. The taint of it is firmly embedded in the Democratic Party, and the dangers are embedded in this election. If you want to know what this ""new deal"" and this sort of money does to a people, ask any of your neighbors who have relatives in Europe, especially in Germany.
I have stated that I do not favor the prepayment of the soldiers' bonus of $2,300 million. It was passed by the last Democratic House of Representatives. It will no doubt be attempted again. The Democratic candidate has not yet stated to the American people fairly and squarely what his attitude will be upon that subject.
The reasons why I do not approve of it can be illustrated by the father who in a generous moment promised his young son a bonus of $100 when he was 21 years old. That boy was led to ask his father for the $100 13 years in advance. His father said: ""Times are bad. I am hard-pressed. I have to bring up and educate a great many children, and I haven't the money. I am placing $5 per annum in the savings bank and as it is compounded it will amount to the $100 when you are 21 years old."" Some of his friends added that he might pay the boy in stage money.
Now, the moral of that story is that you cannot eat your loaf of compound interest before the dough has had time to rise. And the further political moral of that story is that it was said by the father's political opponents that his son would never vote for his father for public office.
There is no one in high public office who knows better than I do from personal observation the service given by the youth of this country in the Great War. I have insisted upon their care when in distress. I have expanded the services given to the veterans at the cost of much personal criticism. But with all of my regard and my feeling I cannot endanger the stability of this country in this special demand of a part of the veterans or any other special group.
Someone just asked the difference between this payment and the loans given by the Reconstruction Corporation. There is just this difference: One of them is a large gift from the Government and the other is loans upon security for a period of 6 months only.
But of one thing I will assure the veterans, and that is, when they are paid, they will be paid in real American money.
During the past few weeks the Democratic candidate has had a great deal to say in endeavoring to establish the idea in the minds of the American people that I am personally responsible for the bad loans by American bankers and investors to numerous foreign countries. He says: ""This is an unsavory chapter in American finance."" I agree with part of that. ""These bonds are in large part the fruit of the distressing policies pursued by the present administration in Washington. None other, if you please, than the ability of lending to backward and crippled countries."" That is the end of the quotation from him.
The Governor does not inform the American people that there is no Federal law regulating the sale of securities and that there is doubtful constitutional authority for such a law. And he fails to state that most of these bonds are issued from the State of New York, which sovereignty has such an authority, and where the government has done nothing of a reform to that evil, if it be one. I recollect a Republican Governor of New York who, believing that wrong was being done to the citizens of his own and other States on life insurance, found a man named Charles Evans Hughes who cleaned that mess up once and for all.
The Governor has not stated to the American people my oft-repeated warnings that American loans made in foreign countries should be upon sound security and confined to reproductive purposes. I have defined these loans as being the loans made for creative enterprise on which their own earnings would repay interest and capital. In one of his addresses the Governor pretends at least not to understand what a reproductive loan is, and yet, as I will show you in a moment, he does know something about it. I will say at once that when we have surplus capital, properly secured loans for reproductive purposes abroad are an advantage to the American people. They furnish work to American labor in the manufacture of plants and equipments; they furnish continuing demand for American labor in supplies and replacements. The effect of such creative enterprise is to increase the standards of living amongst the people in those localities and enable them to buy more American Products and furnish additional work for American labor.
I have no apologies to make for that statement. It is sound; it makes for the upbuilding of the world; it makes for employment of American workmen and profits for American investors. If it be followed there would be no losses. In these statements made by the Governor he entirely omits the conditions and warnings with which I have repeatedly surrounded the statements upon this subject and the warnings which indeed I have given broadcast over the last 7 years in respect to this type of investment. Although no Federal official has any authority to control the security offered on these loans, none of them have defaulted where the safeguards proposed by me have been followed.
It is obvious from the Governor's many speeches that he now considers that all foreign loans are wrong. He seems to consider the selling of foreign bonds in our country to be wicked and the cause of our calamities. And an interesting part of all this tirade is that I have never yet been engaged in the selling of foreign bonds and foreign loans. I have not been accused of that. The Governor, however, has an advantage over me in experience in that particular. As late as 1928 the Governor was engaged in that business for profit and actively occupied in promotion of such loans. At that time he was the chairman of the organization committee of the Federal International Banking Company, a corporation organized for the selling of foreign securities and bonds to the American people. I have in my hand a prospectus of that corporation in which the foreword, written by Mr. Roosevelt before he resigned that position to take the Governorship, reads as follows:
""The organizers of the Federal International Banking Company feel that foreign investments are in the nature of alliances ....The Federal International Banking Company will provide a new source of supply from which American demand for foreign investments may be satisfied .... It is intended to promote the expansion of American foreign trade .... Investments in the Federal International Banking are intended to be self-liquidating .... It will be put to sound protective uses a part of the surplus capital of our Nation.""
""... its operations can be widely distributed in foreign countries and various industries.""
""... that we must aid foreign debtors to purchase our products, rehabilitate themselves, expand and develop, and earn money with which to liquidate their debts, that foreign loans should be facilitated to aid the export sale of American products.""
Now I'll ask you if any more vivid statement of the policies which I have just pronounced to you was ever made than that.
Throughout this prospectus constant reference is made to the fact that it is organized under the law, and the impression is given that in consequence it has some sort of official blessing from the Federal Government, including quotations from myself.
I have no reason to believe, I do not believe, that the Governor's enterprise on this occasion was not perfectly proper and was soundly rounded. I do not wish to convey any such an impression. But the Governor as a private promoter for profit during the boom of 1928 believed and practiced what the Governor, a Presidential candidate, now denounces immoral and a cause of our calamities.
Two weeks ago at Cleveland I felt it was necessary to denounce certain calumnies being circulated in this campaign by the Democratic National Committee in official instructions to their campaign speakers. That committee privately acknowledged that these have not a shred of foundation, and yet they refuse to take the manly course and withdraw those statements. They have sought to maintain their continuing poison by silence.
I now have before me other calumnies of the Democratic National Committee, circulated in the same fashion by instructions to their campaign speakers. These instructions bristle with titles such as these-and these questions will interest American women--they are entitled:
""How President Hoover has failed children.""
""His real interest in the Nation's children may be gained by his re-corded effort to emasculate and disrupt the Children's Bureau.""
""The bunk of the Home Loan Bank.""
Governor Roosevelt implies his endorsement of these calumnies by repeating these implications in his speeches when he speaks of what he calls ""... attempts that have been made to cut appropriations for child welfare.""
And again when he states that: ""the United States Public Health Service has said that over 6 million of our public school children have not enough to eat; many of them are fainting at their desks; they are the prey of disease; and their future health is menaced.""
In another speech he uttered a slur on the Home Loan Banking System created by this administration largely through the leadership of your Senator.
These things have importance only as indicating the desperate attempts to mislead the American voter. No woman in the United States believes that I am called upon to defend my interest in children over the past score of years. But more to the point of this discussion, I have a letter from the Chief of the United States Public Health Service to the effect that no such statement as that quoted by Governor Roosevelt has ever been put out by him or by that Service. Furthermore, I have an address, only a week old, by the president of the American Public Health Association, who is not a Government official, saying that ""by and large, the health oњ the people as measured in sickness and in death has never been better in the history of the United States despite this depression."" That shows the devoted work of thousands of American women and men whom his statements in this campaign sought to slur.
As to the Children's Bureau, I may demonstrate the untruth of that statement by the fact that the first year of my administration, despite hard times, I increased the appropriations of that Bureau from $320,000 to $368,000, which was every cent the Bureau asked for, and in the second year I recommended appropriations of $399,000, which was every cent they said they could advantageously spend, and in the third year I recommended appropriations of $395,000, but the Democratic House of Representatives reduced this by $20,000. That scarcely looks like an attempt to ruin the Children's Bureau--especially on my part.
In the matter of the home loan banks, the Governor states that this idea was brought out in the middle of the campaign, and, like the instructions to speakers sent out by the Democratic National Committee he makes slurs upon it. That statement falls a little to the ground in the same slough of untruth as the others when it is recollected that I rounded the Better Homes movement in the United States more than 10 years ago, whose activities in over 9,000 different communities through the devoted service of thousands of American women finally blossomed into the White House Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership more than a year ago. On that occasion I proposed and secured the backing of the men and women of the United States for the plan which ultimately resulted in the home loan banks. And that bill was drafted and presented to Congress in December last. The refusal of the Democratic House of Representatives to act prevented its passage until the last hour of the session 8 months later and then only when the pressures from the women and the men devoted to the upbuilding of the American home had become so great that they dare not defeat it in the face of this political campaign.
Had that bill been passed when it was introduced, nearly a year ago, the suffering and losses of thousands of small homeowners in the United States would have been prevented. I consider that that act was the greatest act yet undertaken by any government at any time on behalf of thousands of owners of small homes. It provides the machinery, through the mobilization of building and loan associations and savings bank, by which we may assure to men and women the opportunity to bring up their children in the surroundings which make for true unity and true purpose in American life.
Now, in conclusion, in Governor Roosevelt's address delivered on October 25, he stated:
""After March 4, 1929, the Republican Party was in complete control of all branches of the Government--Executive, Senate, and House, and I may add, for good measure . . . the Supreme Court as well.""
I invite your attention to that statement about the Supreme Court. There are many things revealed in this campaign by our opponents which should give American citizens concern for the future. One of the gravest is the state of mind revealed by my opponent in that statement. He implies that it is the function of a party in power to control the Supreme Court. For generations the Republican and Democratic Presidents alike have made it their most sacred duty to respect and maintain the independence of America's greatest tribunal. President Taft appointed a Democratic Chief Justice; President Harding mated a Democratic Justice; my last appointment was a Democrat from the State of New York whose appointment was applauded by Republicans and Democrats alike the Nation over. All appointees of the Supreme Court have been chosen solely on the basis of their character and their mental power. Not since the Civil War have the members of that Court divided on political lines.
Aside from the fact that the charge that the Supreme Court has been controlled by any political party is an atrocious one, there is a deeper implication in that statement. Does it disclose the Democratic candidate's conception of the functions of the Supreme Court? Does he expect the Supreme Court to be subservient to him and his party ? Does that statement express his intention by his appointments or otherwise to attempt to reduce that tribunal to an instrument of party policy and political action for sustaining such doctrines as he may bring with him?
My countrymen, I repeat to you, the fundamental issue of this campaign, the decision that will fix the national direction for a hundred years to come, is whether we shall go on in fidelity to American traditions or whether we shall turn to innovations, the spirit of which is disclosed to us by many sinister revelations and veiled promises.
My friends, I wish to make my position clear. I propose to go on in the faith and loyalty to the traditions of our race. I propose to build upon the foundations which our fathers have laid over this last 150 years.

Bernie Sanders,United States of America,2020-08-17,"Good evening. Our great nation is now living in an unprecedented moment. We’re facing the worst public health crisis in a hundred years, and the worst economic collapse since the great depression. We are confronting systemic racism and the enormous threat to our planet of climate change. And in the midst of all of this, we have a president who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. This election is the most important in the modern history of this country. In response to the unprecedented crises we face, we need an unprecedented response, a movement like never before, of people who are prepared to stand up and fight for democracy and decency, and against greed, oligarchy, and bigotry. And we need Joe Biden as our next president. Let me take this opportunity to say a word to the millions of people who supported my campaign this year and in 2016.
My friends, thank you for your trust, your support, and the love you show Jane, me, and our family. Together we have moved this country in a bold new direction, showing that all of us, black and white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, yearn for a nation based on the principles of justice, love, and compassion. Our campaign ended several months ago, but our movement continues and is getting stronger every day. Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical on now mainstream. But let us be clear if Donald Trump is re-elected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy. At its most basic, this election is about preserving our democracy. During this president’s term, the unthinkable has become normal. He has tried to prevent people from voting, undermined the US Postal Service, deployed the military and federal agents against peaceful protestors, threatened to delay the election, and suggested that he will not leave office if he loses.
This is not normal and we must never treat it like it is. Under this administration, authoritarianism has taken root in our country. I and my family and many of yours, know the insidious way authoritarianism destroys democracy, decency, and humanity. As long as I am here, I will work with Progressive’s, with Moderates, and yes, with Conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat. This president is not just a threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science, he has put our lives and health in jeopardy. Trump has attacked doctors and scientists trying to protect us from the pandemic, while refusing to take strong action, to produce the masks, gowns, and gloves our healthcare workers desperately need. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people.
Furthermore, Trump’s negligence has exacerbated the economic crisis we are now experiencing. Since this pandemic began, over 30 million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. Millions of working families are wondering how they will feed their kids, and they’re worried that they will be evicted from their homes. And how has Trump responded? Instead of maintaining the $600 a week unemployment supplement that workers were receiving, and the $1,200 emergency checks that many of you received… Instead of helping small businesses, Trump concocted fraudulent executive orders that do virtually nothing to address the crisis, while threatening the very future of Social Security and Medicare.
But the truth is that even before Trump’s negligent response to this pandemic, too many hardworking families have been caught on an economic treadmill with no hope of ever getting ahead. Together, we must build a nation that is more equitable, more compassionate, and more inclusive. I know that Joe Biden will begin that fight on day one. Let me offer you just a few examples of how Joe will move us forward. Joe supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This will give 40 million workers a pay raise, and push the wage scale up for everyone else. Joe will also-
Paid scale up for everyone else. Joe will also make it easier for workers to join unions, create 12 weeks of paid family leave, fund universal pre-K for three and four year olds and make childcare affordable for millions of families. Joe will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and fight the threat of climate change by transitioning us to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years. These initiatives will create millions of good paying jobs all across our country. As you know, we are the only industrialized nation not to guarantee healthcare for all people. While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage, he has a plan that will greatly expand healthcare and cut the cost of prescription drugs. Further, he will lower the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 down to 60.
To help reform our broken criminal justice system. Joe will end private prisons and detention centers, cash bail, and the school to prison pipeline. To heal the soul of our nation, Joe Biden will end the hate and division trump has created. He will stop the demonization of immigrants, the coddling of white nationalists, the racist dog whistling, the religious bigotry, and the ugly attacks on women.
My friends, I say to you, to everyone who supported other candidates in the primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election, the future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. We must come together, defeat Donald Trump, and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president. My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine. Thank you.
The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake.

Grant Shapps,United Kingdom,2020-01-10,"Passengers in the north have had to put up with unacceptable services for too long. We understand how frustrating this has been for people and we are taking action to make sure that performance improves.
This was triggered by concern over the financial position of ARN.
It has now been confirmed to me from the most recent available financial information that the franchise will only be able to continue for a number of months. The proposal I requested from ARN is being evaluated. Following completion of this process I will consider whether to award ARN a short-term management contract or whether to ask the Department of Transport’s own operator of Last Resort to step in and deliver passenger services. Longer-term decisions on the franchise will be made in the light of the recommendations of the Williams Rail Review.
My decision on which short-term option to choose will be made in accordance with the key principles set out in the statement on how I use my rail franchising powers. This includes:
– protecting the interests of passengers
– ensuring business and service continuity
– preserving the interests of taxpayers by ensuring value for money
– the continued quality of the franchise proposition;
In order to inform this decision, the Department will assess the extent to which each option performs against these principles. Our value for money assessment will be based on a number of criteria, including which option returns most money to the taxpayer, the risks attached to each, and the value of any improvements in passenger services. I intend to announce my decision before the end of January 2020.
To clarify, the current financial position of the Northern franchise will not impact on the railway’s day-to-day operations. Services will continue to run and there will be no impact on staff.

Nusrat Ghani,United Kingdom,2019-01-25,"I am today announcing the publication of Maritime 2050: Navigating the Future, the government’s landmark strategy setting out our vision and ambitions for the future of the British maritime sector.
Our nation depends on the wide range of benefits the maritime sector delivers. It contributes over £14 billion a year to the UK economy and directly supports an estimated 186,000 jobs. Around 95% of British imports and exports are moved by sea. The leisure and marine sectors are vital to our enjoyment of the seas. Our maritime clusters around the UK showcase the diversity of our regional economies, from professional services in London to ship management and educational excellence in Scotland.
We rightly take pride in our maritime past. Maritime 2050 is about looking forward; anticipating the challenges and opportunities ahead and recognising the UK’s strengths so we are well placed to capitalise on them. Maritime 2050 looks at these across 7 themes and under each makes short, medium and long-term recommendations:
It highlights multi-billion pound commercial investment in maritime infrastructure at ports and beyond. Our unwavering commitment to safety and security. Our reputation for innovation, paving the way on regulatory frameworks and technology to facilitate smart shipping and autonomy; leading the way in clean maritime growth. But no matter how far advances in ships and technology take us, it sets out how the people graduating from our maritime training and academic institutions will reflect the world around us and continue to be sought after across the globe for their skills.
As the global maritime sector adapts to challenges such as climate change, rapid technological advances and security concerns, Maritime 2050 sets a series of strategic ambitions around which government and the sector will focus its efforts, and core values which we will be guided by.
The partnership between government and the maritime sector has been vital to the development of this strategy. It began in March 2018 with a call for evidence, seeking to reach all branches of the sector, complemented by workshops around the UK to capture the views from across our maritime clusters, and interviews with leaders in industry and academia. Maritime 2050 has also benefited from the advice and scrutiny of an independent panel of 13 internationally respected academics, industry leaders, maritime business services providers and promotional bodies. As a result, Maritime 2050 reflects the depth and breadth of the UK’s rich maritime sector.
A copy of Maritime 2050 has been placed in the library of both Houses and is available on GOV.UK, together with the trade and technology route maps setting out in greater detail the steps needed to achieve the UK’s strategic maritime ambitions.

Justin Trudeau,Canada,2020-04-03,"Good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us today.
Before we get into things, I have two pieces of news to share with everyone.
The first one is about the distribution of critical equipment to provinces and territories.
For the past few weeks, our government has been working closely with industry to produce the supplies our health care workers need like masks, face shields, gowns, ventilators, and test kits.
Well today, I can announce that our government has signed an agreement with Amazon Canada to manage the distribution of this equipment to the provinces and territories.
Amazon will use its wide distribution network to deliver medical equipment where it is needed the most.
The second announcement I want to make this morning is about the army.
We have received a request from the Government of Quebec for help from the Canadian Armed Forces for northern and isolated communities.
As I said earlier this week, our Canadians in uniform are always ready to help communities fight COVID-19.
I can therefore confirm that the Armed Forces will be there for Quebecers and for all Canadians.
COVID-19 has been turning our lives upside down for a few weeks now.
We are doing school work at home. We are limiting travel. We are staying at home as much as possible.
The pandemic is having consequences on all of us, but some families are going through even more difficult and uncertain times.
If you have lost your job, if you are not getting a paycheque, you are wondering how you are going to not only pay your bills at the end of the month, but also buy food the next day.
Across the country, there are food banks that can help.
Food banks and charities do incredible work for our communities all year long.
But like most organizations, food banks are facing new challenges because of this pandemic.
For example, most of their volunteers are retirees, who are more at risk of catching COVID-19. This means fewer people to serve a growing clientele.
With everyone staying home, they have fewer volunteers. And a difficult economic climate means that they are receiving fewer donations that they normally would while demand rises.
The staff at the Neighbour to Neighbour Food Bank in Hamilton told us that they’re getting more and more calls. And it’s overwhelming for the volunteers who are spread really thin and working overtime to help their community.
There is also Maison de Quartier Villeray, which I have known for many years, where people work extremely hard to help their neighbours in my riding of Papineau.
The work being done by food banks and their volunteers is essential, so there’s no question that they need more support during this crisis.
If you have the time and the ability to help, reach out to your local food bank and ask them how you can help them.
At the same time, I’m announcing that the government will provide $100 million to meet the urgent food needs of vulnerable Canadians, including those living in Indigenous and northern communities.
This money will help ensure that organizations can buy and deliver food to those who need it the most.
It will help support organizations you may already know like Food Banks Canada, Breakfast Club, Moisson Montréal, the Salvation Army, and many more.
And on that note, I do want to take a moment to thank all the volunteers and organizers.
Thank you for feeding our communities, we see you and we are grateful for the incredible, tireless, work you do even in these extremely difficult circumstances, especially in these extremely difficult circumstances. You are doing essential work for our most vulnerable. You are showing what it is to be Canadian, to be there for each other in times of difficulty.
I know that many of you are having a hard time right now.
The pandemic is creating a lot of uncertainty and you’re worried.
But I want you to know that our government will not let you down.
We are investing in food banks so that you can meet your family’s urgent needs during this crisis.
And, at the same time, we are providing financial support to those who have lost their job or their paycheque because of COVID-19.
We are implementing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which will provide you with $2,000 a month.
Our government is also supplementing the GST Credit to help low-income people.
We had said that in May, every qualifying adult would receive up to $300 with $150 for each child, but I can now confirm that help is coming sooner, this month, in April instead.
Our government has also been working with major banks to deliver benefits, including the CERB, through direct deposit.
Effective today, people should visit their bank’s website for information on how to enroll for direct deposit if they haven’t already.
I know that a lot of you want to know how long this is going to last.
You are asking when you will be able to see your friends, hug your grandparents, and have people over for dinner.
Last night, I spoke with the provincial and territorial premiers and we mainly discussed the sharing of information and projections.
The good news is, we are testing a lot more people and the experts have new data to analyze.
The provinces and territories are currently updating their data and will publish the latest information soon.
As for the federal government, we are working very hard to check the latest figures so we can post them online.
Please visit canada.ca/coronavirus for the best up-to-date information on the spread of the virus. 
I would love to be able to tell you exactly when this will end. I often talk about weeks or maybe even months, but the truth is, it will really depend on each of us.
The best way to minimize the impact of COVID-19 is to continue following the experts’ advice.
You know what they are saying.
Stay home as much as possible.
Limit non-essential trips.
And if you must absolutely go out, stay at least two metres away from other people.
Continue doing your part and I promise you we will get through this.
I want to close with a message for kids.
On Sunday, I will be holding a video conference focused on you with Dr. Tam.
So, send me your questions through the CBCKids’ website by the end of the day, and I’m looking forward to answering you this weekend.
Thank you very much, everyone.

Donald Trump,United States of America,1999-11-10,"Well, basically, this would be a one-time tax, 14.25 percent against people with a net worth of over 10 million--$10 million or more. It would pay off in its entirety the national debt of $5.7 trillion, and you'd save $200 billion a year. So taxes for the middle class would go way down, the estate and inheritance tax totally wiped out, and the Social Security system would be saved. Now, this would be very positive for everybody, including the rich, the 1 percent that really are paying the tax.
That's correct.
I think it would be great for the country. I think it's a proposal that will be very strongly looked at and considered. And ultimately, I really expect to get it back.
It's a very fair question and very good question that's been thought of in great detail. Some people would be able to sell things off, easily pay the tax, and ultimately get it back many fold by the booming economy. And you will have a boom like you literally have never had before and by the saving of the inheritance tax.
Well, they sell off assets, you'd sell off assets. And the other...
Well, in my case it could be some real estate, we wouldn't sell everything, you'd sell some assets. And the other is that we do it over an installment of 10 years.
If I were president, it would be passed. I think if somebody else is president, it probably can't be. This is a tax paid by 1 percent, but the 1 percent will be very big beneficiaries with what's going to happen and the positive forces that would take place in the economy.
Of course.
I know lots of very great and talented economists. The ones that I've spoken to and consulted with and I'll be announcing who they are at a later date, if I decide to run, have said that this plan is, quote, ""brilliant."" I don't want to take the whole credit, but they have said it. They they...
",ABC: Bill Redeker Interviews Donald Trump on GMA,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-abc-bill-redeker-good-morning-america-november-10-1999
Bill Clinton,United States of America,1995-07-19 00:00:00,"Thank you very much. To the Members of Congress who are here, members of the Cabinet and the administration, my fellow Americans:
In recent weeks I have begun a conversation with the American people about our fate and our duty to prepare our Nation not only to meet the new century but to live and lead in a world transformed to a degree seldom seen in all of our history. Much of this change is good, but it is not all good, and all of us are affected by it. Therefore, we must reach beyond our fears and our divisions to a new time of great and common purpose.
Our challenge is twofold: first, to restore the American dream of opportunity and the American value of responsibility; and second, to bring our country together amid all our diversity into a stronger community, so that we can find common ground and move forward as one.
More than ever these two endeavors are inseparable. I am absolutely convinced we cannot restore economic opportunity or solve our social problems unless we find a way to bring the American people together. To bring our people together we must openly and honestly deal with the issues that divide us. Today I want to discuss one of those issues, affirmative action.
It is, in a way, ironic that this issue should be divisive today, because affirmative action began 25 years ago by a Republican President with bipartisan support. It began simply as a means to an end of enduring national purpose, equal opportunity for all Americans.
So let us today trace the roots of affirmative action in our never-ending search for equal opportunity. Let us determine what it is and what it isn't. Let us see where it's worked and where it hasn't and ask ourselves what we need to do now. Along the way, let us remember always that finding common ground as we move toward the 21st century depends fundamentally on our shared commitment to equal opportunity for all Americans. It is a moral imperative, a constitutional mandate, and a legal necessity.
There could be no better place for this discussion than the National Archives, for within these walls are America's bedrocks of our common ground, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. No paper is as lasting as the words these documents contain, so we put them in these special cases to protect the parchment from the elements. No building is as solid as the principles these documents embody, but we sure tried to build one with these metal doors 11 inches thick to keep them safe, for these documents are America's only crown jewels. But the best place of all to hold these words and these principles is the one place in which they can never fade and never grow old, in the stronger chambers of our hearts.
Beyond all else, our country is a set of convictions: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Our whole history can be seen first as an effort to preserve these rights and then as an effort to make them real in the lives of all our citizens.
We know that from the beginning there was a great gap between the plain meaning of our creed and the meaner reality of our daily lives. Back then, only white male property owners could vote. Black slaves were not even counted as whole people, and Native Americans were regarded as little more than an obstacle to our great national progress. No wonder Thomas Jefferson, reflecting on slavery, said he trembled to think God is just.
On the 200th anniversary of our great Constitution, Justice Thurgood Marshall, the grandson of a slave, said, ""The Government our Founders devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights we hold as fundamental today.""
Emancipation, women's suffrage, civil rights, voting rights, equal rights, the struggle for the rights of the disabled, all these and other struggles are milestones on America's often rocky but fundamentally righteous journey to close the gap between the ideals enshrined in these treasures here in the National Archives and the reality of our daily lives.
I first came to this very spot where I'm standing today 32 years ago this month. I was a 16-year-old delegate to the American Legion Boys Nation. Now, that summer was a high-water mark for our national journey.
That was the summer that President Kennedy ordered Alabama National Guardsmen to enforce a court order to allow two young blacks to enter the University of Alabama. As he told our Nation, ""Every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated.""
Later that same summer, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Martin Luther King told Americans of his dream that one day the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners would sit down together at the table of brotherhood, that one day his four little children would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. His words captured the hearts and steeled the wills of millions of Americans. Some of them sang with him in the hot sun that day. Millions more like me listened and wept in the privacy of their homes.
It's hard to believe where we were just three decades ago. When I came up here to Boys Nation and we had this mock congressional session, I was one of only three or four southerners who would even vote for the civil rights plank. That's largely because of my family. My grandfather had a grade school education and ran a grocery store across the street from the cemetery in Hope, Arkansas, where my parents and my grandparents are buried. Most of his customers were black, were poor, and were working people. As a child in that store, I saw that people of different races could treat each other with respect and dignity. But I also saw that the black neighborhood across the street was the only one in town where the streets weren't paved. And when I returned to that neighborhood in the late sixties to see a woman who had cared for me as a toddler, the streets still weren't paved. A lot of you know that I am an ardent movie-goer. As a child, I never went to a movie where I could sit next to a black American. They were always sitting upstairs.
In the 1960's, believe it or not, there were still a few courthouse squares in my State where the restrooms were marked ""white"" and ""colored."" I graduated from a segregated high school 7 years after President Eisenhower integrated Little Rock Central High School. And when President Kennedy barely carried my home State in 1960, the poll tax system was still alive and well there.
Even though my grandparents were in a minority, being poor Southern whites who were pro-civil rights, I think most other people knew better than to think the way they did. And those who were smart enough to act differently discovered a lesson that we ought to remember today: Discrimination is not just morally wrong, it hurts everybody.
In 1960, Atlanta, Georgia, in reaction to all the things that were going on all across the South, adopted the motto, ""the city too busy to hate."" And however imperfectly over the years, they tried to live by it. I am convinced that Atlanta's success -- it now is home to more foreign corporations than any other American city, and one year from today it will begin to host the Olympics -- that that success all began when people got too busy to hate.
The lesson we learned was a hard one. When we allow people to pit us against one another or spend energy denying opportunity based on our differences, everyone is held back. But when we give all Americans a chance to develop and use their talents, to be full partners in our common enterprise, then everybody is pushed forward.
My experiences with discrimination are rooted in the South and in the legacy slavery left. I also lived with a working mother and a working grandmother when women's work was far rarer and far more circumscribed than it is today. But we all know there are millions of other stories, those of Hispanics, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, people with disabilities, others against whom fingers have been pointed. Many of you have your own stories, and that's why you're here today, people who were denied the right to develop and to use their full human potential. And their progress, too, is a part of our journey to make the reality of America consistent with the principles just behind me here.
Thirty years ago in this city, you didn't see many people of color or women making their way to work in the morning in business clothes or serving in substantial numbers in powerful positions in Congress or at the White House or making executive decisions every day in businesses. In fact, even the employment want ads were divided, men on one side and women on the other. It was extraordinary then to see women or people of color as television news anchors or, believe it or not, even in college sports. There were far fewer women and minorities as job supervisors or firefighters or police officers or doctors or lawyers or college professors or in many other jobs that offer stability and honor and integrity to family life.
A lot has changed, and it did not happen as some sort of random evolutionary drift. It took hard work and sacrifices and countless acts of courage and conscience by millions of Americans. It took the political courage and statesmanship of Democrats and Republicans alike, the vigilance and compassion of courts and advocates in and out of Government committed to the Constitution and to equal protection and to equal opportunity. It took the leadership of people in business who knew that in the end we would all be better. It took the leadership of people in labor unions who knew that working people had to be reconciled.
Some people, like Congressman Lewis there, put their lives on the line. Other people lost their lives. And millions of Americans changed their own lives and put hate behind them. As a result, today all our lives are better. Women have become a major force in business and political life and far more able to contribute to their families' incomes. A true and growing black middle class has emerged. Higher education has literally been revolutionized, with women and racial and ethnic minorities attending once overwhelmingly white and sometimes all-male schools. In communities across our Nation, police departments now better reflect the makeup of those whom they protect. A generation of professionals now serve as role models for young women and minority youth. Hispanics and newer immigrant populations are succeeding in making America stronger.
For an example of where the best of our future lies, just think about our space program and the stunning hookup with the Russian space station this month. Let's remember that that program, the world's finest, began with heroes like Alan Shepard and Senator John Glenn, but today it's had American heroes like Sally Ride, Ellen Ochoa, Leroy Chiao, Guy Bluford, and other outstanding, completely qualified women and minorities.
How did this happen? Fundamentally, because we opened our hearts and minds and changed our ways. But not without pressure, the pressure of court decisions, legislation, executive action, and the power of examples in the public and private sector. Along the way we learned that laws alone do not change society, that old habits and thinking patterns are deeply ingrained and die hard, that more is required to really open the doors of opportunity. Our search to find ways to move more quickly to equal opportunity led to the development of what we now call affirmative action.
The purpose of affirmative action is to give our Nation a way to finally address the systemic exclusion of individuals of talent on the basis of their gender or race from opportunities to develop, perform, achieve, and contribute. Affirmative action is an effort to develop a systematic approach to open the doors of education, employment, and business development opportunities to qualified individuals who happen to be members of groups that have experienced longstanding and persistent discrimination.
It is a policy that grew out of many years of trying to navigate between two unacceptable pasts. One was to say simply that we declared discrimination illegal and that's enough. We saw that that way still relegated blacks with college degrees to jobs as railroad porters and kept women with degrees under a glass ceiling with a lower paycheck.
The other path was simply to try to impose change by leveling draconian penalties on employers who didn't meet certain imposed, ultimately arbitrary, and sometimes unachievable quotas. That, too, was rejected out of a sense of fairness.
So a middle ground was developed that would change an inequitable status quo gradually but firmly, by building the pool of qualified applicants for college, for contracts, for jobs, and giving more people the chance to learn, work, and earn. When affirmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works.
I know some people are honestly concerned about the times affirmative action doesn't work, when it's done in the wrong way. And I know there are times when some employers don't use it in the right way. They may cut corners and treat a flexible goal as a quota. They may give opportunities to people who are unqualified instead of those who deserve it. They may, in so doing, allow a different kind of discrimination. When this happens, it is also wrong. But it isn't affirmative action, and it is not legal.
So when our administration finds cases of that sort, we will enforce the law aggressively. The Justice Department files hundreds of cases every year attacking discrimination in employment, including suits on behalf of white males. Most of these suits, however, affect women and minorities for a simple reason, because the vast majority of discrimination in America is still discrimination against them. But the law does require fairness for everyone, and we are determined to see that that is exactly what the law delivers.
Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won't allow it to be. It does not mean and I don't favor the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn't mean and I don't favor numerical quotas. It doesn't mean and I don't favor rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit.
Like many business executives and public servants, I owe it to you to say that my views on this subject are, more than anything else, the product of my personal experience. I have had experience with affirmative action, nearly 20 years of it now, and I know it works.
When I was attorney general of my home State, I hired a record number of women and African-American lawyers, every one clearly qualified and exceptionally hardworking. As Governor, I appointed more women to my Cabinet and State boards than any other Governor in the State's history, and more African-Americans than all the Governors in the State's history combined. And no one ever questioned their qualifications or performance, and our State was better and stronger because of their service.
As President, I am proud to have the most diverse administration in history in my Cabinet, my agencies, and my staff. And I must say, I have been surprised at the criticism I have received from some quarters in my determination to achieve this.
In the last 2 1/2 years, the most outstanding example of affirmative action in the United States, the Pentagon, has opened 260,000 positions for women who serve in our Armed Forces. I have appointed more women and minorities to the Federal bench than any other President, more than the last two combined. And yet, far more of our judicial appointments have received the highest rating from the American Bar Association than any other administration since those ratings have been given.
In our administration many Government agencies are doing more business with qualified firms run by minorities and women. The Small Business Administration has reduced its budget by 40 percent, doubled its loan outputs, dramatically increased the number of loans to women and minority small business people, without reducing the number of loans to white businessowners who happen to be male and without changing the loan standards for a single, solitary application. Quality and diversity can go hand-in-hand, and they must.
Let me say that affirmative action has also done more than just open the doors of opportunity to individual Americans. Most economists who study it agree that affirmative action has also been an important part of closing gaps in economic opportunity in our society, thereby strengthening the entire economy.
A group of distinguished business leaders told me just a couple of days ago that their companies are stronger and their profits are larger because of the diversity and the excellence of their work forces achieved through intelligent and fair affirmative action programs. And they said, ""We have gone far beyond anything the Government might require us to do because managing diversity and individual opportunity and being fair to everybody is the key to our future economic success in the global marketplace.""
Now, there are those who say, my fellow Americans, that even good affirmative action programs are no longer needed, that it should be enough to resort to the courts or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in cases of actual, provable, individual discrimination because there is no longer any systematic discrimination in our society. In deciding how to answer that, let us consider the facts.
The unemployment rate for African-Americans remains about twice that of whites. The Hispanic rate is still much higher. Women have narrowed the earnings gap, but still make only 72 percent as much as men do for comparable jobs. The average income for an Hispanic woman with a college degree is still less than the average income of a white man with a high school diploma.
According to the recently completed glass ceiling report, sponsored by Republican Members of Congress, in the Nation's largest companies only six-tenths of one percent of senior management positions are held by African-Americans, four-tenths of a percent by Hispanic-Americans, three-tenths of a percent by Asian-Americans; women hold between 3 and 5 percent of these positions. White males make up 43 percent of our work force but hold 95 percent of these jobs.
Just last week, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank reported that black home loan applicants are more than twice as likely to be denied credit as whites with the same qualifications and that Hispanic applicants are more than 1 1/2 times as likely to be denied loans as whites with the same qualifications.
Last year alone the Federal Government received more than 90,000 complaints of employment discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender; less than 3 percent were for reverse discrimination.
Evidence abounds in other ways of the persistence of the kind of bigotry that can affect the way we think, even if we're not conscious of it, in hiring and promotion and business and educational decisions.
Crimes and violence based on hate against Asians, Hispanics, African-Americans, and other minorities are still with us. And I'm sorry to say that the worst and most recent evidence of this involves a recent report of Federal law enforcement officials in Tennessee attending an event literally overflowing with racism, a sickening reminder of just how pervasive these kinds of attitudes still are.
By the way, I want to tell you that I am committed to finding the truth about what happened there and to taking appropriate action. And I want to say that if anybody who works in Federal law enforcement thinks that that kind of behavior is acceptable, they ought to think about working someplace else.
Now, let's get to the other side of the argument. If affirmative action has worked and if there is evidence that discrimination still exists on a wide scale in ways that are conscious and unconscious, then why should we get rid of it as many people are urging? Some question the effectiveness or the fairness of particular affirmative action programs. I say to all of you, those are fair questions, and they prompted the review of our affirmative action programs about which I will talk in a few moments.
Some question the fundamental purpose of the effort. There are people who honestly believe that affirmative action always amounts to group preferences over individual merit, that affirmative action always leads to reverse discrimination, that ultimately, therefore, it demeans those who benefit from it and discriminates against those who are not helped by it.
I just have to tell you that all of you have to decide how you feel about that, and all of our fellow country men and women have to decide as well. But I believe if there are no quotas, if we give no opportunities to unqualified people, if we have no reverse discrimination, and if, when the problem ends, the program ends, that criticism is wrong. That's what I believe. But we should have this debate, and everyone should ask the question.
Now let's deal with what I really think is behind so much of this debate today. There are a lot of people who oppose affirmative action today who supported it for a very long time. I believe they are responding to the sea change in the experiences that most Americans have in the world in which we live. If you say now you're against affirmative action because the Government is using its power or the private sector is using its power to help minorities at the expense of the majority, that gives you a way of explaining away the economic distress that a majority of Americans honestly feel. It gives you a way of turning their resentment against the minorities or against a particular Government program, instead of having an honest debate about how we all got into the fix we're in and what we're all going to do together to get out of it.
That explanation, the affirmative action explanation, for the fix we're in is just wrong. It is just wrong. Affirmative action did not cause the great economic problems of the American middle class. And because most minorities or women are either members of that middle class or people who are poor who are struggling to get into it, we must also admit that affirmative action alone won't solve the problems of minorities and women who seek to be a part of the American dream. To do that, we have to have an economic strategy that reverses the decline in wages and the growth of poverty among working people. Without that, women, minorities, and white males will all be in trouble in the future.
But it is wrong to use the anxieties of the middle class to divert the American people from the real causes of their economic distress, the sweeping historic changes taking all the globe in its path and the specific policies or lack of them in our own country which have aggravated those challenges. It is simply wrong to play politics with the issue of affirmative action and divide our country at a time when, if we're really going to change things, we have to be united.
I must say, I think it is ironic that some of those -- not all but some of those who call for an end to affirmative action also advocate policies which will make the real economic problems of the anxious middle class even worse. They talk about opportunity and being for equal opportunity for everyone, and then they reduce investment in equal opportunity on an evenhanded basis. For example, if the real goal is economic opportunity for all Americans, why in the world would we reduce our investment in education from Head Start to affordable college loans? Why don't we make college loans available to every American instead?
If the real goal is empowering all middle class Americans and empowering poor people to work their way into the middle class without regard to race or gender, why in the world would the people who advocate that turn around and raise taxes on our poorest working families, or reduce the money available for education and training when they lose their jobs or they're living on poverty wages, or increase the cost of housing for lower income working people with children? Why would we do that? If we're going to empower America, we have to do more than talk about it. We have to do it. And we surely have learned that we cannot empower all Americans by a simple strategy of taking opportunity away from some Americans.
So to those who use this as a political strategy to divide us, we must say no. We must say no. But to those who raise legitimate questions about the way affirmative action works or who raise the larger question about the genuine problems and anxieties of all the American people and their sense of being left behind and treated unfairly, we must say yes, you are entitled to answers to your questions. We must say yes to that.
Now, that's why I ordered this review of all of our affirmative action programs, a review designed to look at the facts, not the politics, of affirmative action. This review concluded that affirmative action remains a useful tool for widening economic and educational opportunity. The model used by the military, the Army in particular -- and I'm delighted to have the Commanding General of the Army here today because he set such a fine example -- has been especially successful because it emphasizes education and training, ensuring that it has a wide pool of qualified candidates for every level of promotion. That approach has given us the most racially diverse and best qualified military in our history. There are more opportunities for women and minorities there than ever before. And now there are over 50 generals and admirals who are Hispanic, Asian, or African-Americans.
We found that the Education Department targeted on -- had programs targeted on under-represented minorities that do a great deal of good with the tiniest of investments. We found that these programs comprised 40 cents of every $1,000 in the Education Department's budget.
Now, college presidents will tell you that the education their schools offer actually benefit from diversity, colleges where young people get the education and make the personal and professional contacts that will shape their lives. If their colleges look like the world they're going to live and work in and they learn from all different kinds of people things that they can't learn in books, our systems of higher education are stronger.
Still, I believe every child needs the chance to go to college -- every child. That means every child has to have a chance to get affordable and repayable college loans, Pell grants for poor kids, and a chance to do things like join AmeriCorps and work their way through school. Every child is entitled to that. That is not an argument against affirmative action, it's an argument for more opportunity for more Americans until everyone is reached.
As I said a moment ago, the review found that the Small Business Administration last year increased loans to minorities by over two-thirds, loans to women by over 80 percent, did not decrease loans to white men, and not a single loan went to an unqualified person. People who never had a chance before to be part of the American system of free enterprise now have it. No one was hurt in the process. That made America stronger.
This review also found that the Executive order on employment practices of large Federal contractors also has helped to bring more fairness and inclusion into the work force.
Since President Nixon was here in my job, America has used goals and timetables to preserve opportunity and to prevent discrimination, to urge businesses to set higher expectations for themselves and to realize those expectations. But we did not and we will not use rigid quotas to mandate outcomes.
We also looked at the way we award procurement contracts under the programs known as set-asides. There's no question that these programs have helped to build up firms owned by minorities and women, who historically had been excluded from the old-boy networks in these areas. It has helped a new generation of entrepreneurs to flourish, opening new paths to self-reliance and an economic growth in which all of us ultimately share. Because of the set-asides, businesses ready to compete have had a chance to compete, a chance they would not have otherwise had.
But as with any Government program, set-asides can be misapplied, misused, even intentionally abused. There are critics who exploit that fact as an excuse to abolish all these programs, regardless of their effects. I believe they are wrong, but I also believe, based on our factual review, we clearly need some reform. So first, we should crack down on those who take advantage of everyone else through fraud and abuse. We must crack down on fronts and pass-throughs, people who pretend to be eligible for these programs and aren't. That is wrong. We also, in offering new businesses a leg up, must make sure that the set-asides go to businesses that need them most. We must really look and make sure that our standard for eligibility is fair and defensible. We have to tighten the requirement to move businesses out of programs once they've had a fair opportunity to compete. The graduation requirement must mean something: It must mean graduation. There should be no permanent set-aside for any company.
Second, we must and we will comply with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision of last month. Now, in particular, that means focusing set-aside programs on particular regions and business sectors where the problems of discrimination or exclusion are provable and are clearly requiring affirmative action. I have directed the Attorney General and the agencies to move forward with compliance with Adarand expeditiously.
But I also want to emphasize that the Adarand decision did not dismantle affirmative action and did not dismantle set-asides. In fact, while setting stricter standards to mandate reform of affirmative action, it actually reaffirmed the need for affirmative action and reaffirmed the continuing existence of systematic discrimination in the United States. What the Supreme Court ordered the Federal Government to do was to meet the same more rigorous standard for affirmative action programs that State and local governments were ordered to meet several years ago. And the best set-aside programs under that standard have been challenged and have survived.
Third, beyond discrimination we need to do more to help disadvantaged people and distressed communities, no matter what their race or gender. There are places in our country where the free enterprise system simply doesn't reach; it simply isn't working to provide jobs and opportunity. Disproportionately, these areas in urban and rural America are highly populated by racial minorities, but not entirely. To make this initiative work, I believe the Government must become a better partner for people in places in urban and rural America that are caught in a cycle of poverty. And I believe we have to find ways to get the private sector to assume their rightful role as a driver of economic growth.
It has always amazed me that we have given incentives to our business people to help to develop poor economies in other parts of the world, our neighbors in the Caribbean, our neighbors in other parts of the world -- I have supported this when not subject to their own abuses -- but we ignore the biggest source of economic growth available to the American economy, the poor economies isolated within the United States of America.
There are those who say, ""Well, even if we made the jobs available, people wouldn't work."" They haven't tried. Most of the people in disadvantaged communities work today, and most of them who don't work have a very strong desire to do so. In central Harlem, 14 people apply for every single minimum-wage job opening. Think how many more would apply if there were good jobs with a good future. Our job has to connect disadvantaged people and disadvantaged communities to economic opportunity so that everybody who wants to work can do so.
We've been working at this through our empowerment zones and community develop banks, through the initiatives of Secretary Cisneros of the Housing and Urban Development Department and many other things that we have tried to do to put capital where it is needed. And now I have asked Vice President Gore to develop a proposal to use our contracting to support businesses that locate themselves in these distressed areas or hire a large percentage of their workers from these areas, not to supplement what we're doing in affirmative action -- not to substitute for it but to supplement it, to go beyond it, to do something that will help to deal with the economic crisis of America. We want to make our procurement system more responsive to people in these areas who need help.
My fellow Americans, affirmative action has to be made consistent with our highest ideals of personal responsibility and merit and our urgent need to find common ground and to prepare all Americans to compete in the global economy of the next century.
Today I am directing all our agencies to comply with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, and also to apply the four standards of fairness to all our affirmative action programs that I have already articulated: No quotas in theory or practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including reverse discrimination; no preference for people who are not qualified for any job or other opportunity; and as soon as a program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that doesn't meet these four principles must be eliminated or reformed to meet them.
But let me be clear: Affirmative action has been good for America.
Affirmative action has not always been perfect, and affirmative action should not go on forever. It should be changed now to take care of those things that are wrong, and it should be retired when its job is done. I am resolved that that day will come. But the evidence suggests, indeed, screams that that day has not come.
The job of ending discrimination in this country is not over. That should not be surprising. We had slavery for centuries before the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. We waited another 100 years for the civil rights legislation. Women have had the vote less than 100 years. We have always had difficulty with these things, as most societies do. But we are making more progress than many people.
Based on the evidence, the job is not done. So here is what I think we should do. We should reaffirm the principle of affirmative action and fix the practices. We should have a simple slogan: Mend it, but don't end it.
Let me ask all Americans, whether they agree or disagree with what I have said today, to see this issue in the larger context of our times. President Lincoln said, ""We cannot escape our history."" We cannot escape our future, either. And that future must be one in which every American has the chance to live up to his or her God-given capacities.
The new technology, the instant communications, the explosion of global commerce have created enormous opportunities and enormous anxieties for Americans. In the last 2 1/2 years, we have seen 7 million new jobs, more millionaires and new businesses than ever before, high corporate profits, and a booming stock market. Yet, most Americans are working harder for the same or lower pay, and they feel more insecurity about their jobs, their retirement, their health care, and their children's education. Too many of our children are clearly exposed to poverty and welfare, violence and drugs.
These are the great challenges for our whole country on the homefront at the dawn of the 21st century. We've got to find the wisdom and the will to create family-wage jobs for all the people who want to work, to open the door of college to all Americans, to strengthen families and reduce the awful problems to which our children are exposed, to move poor Americans from welfare to work.
This is the work of our administration, to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives, to give families and communities the tools they need to solve their own problems. But let us not forget affirmative action didn't cause these problems. It won't solve them. And getting rid of affirmative action certainly won't solve them.
If properly done, affirmative action can help us come together, go forward, and grow together. It is in our moral, legal, and practical interest to see that every person can make the most of his own life. In the fight for the future, we need all hands on deck, and some of those hands still need a helping hand.
In our national community we're all different; we're all the same. We want liberty and freedom. We want the embrace of family and community. We want to make the most of our own lives, and we're determined to give our children a better one. Today there are voices of division who would say forget all that. Don't you dare. Remember we're still closing the gap between our Founders' ideals and our reality. But every step along the way has made us richer, stronger, and better. And the best is yet to come.
Thank you very much, and God bless you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-02-28,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All I can say is that the fake news just doesn’t get it, do they? They don’t get it. They just don’t get it. Hello Charleston, and I’m thrilled to be back in the great state of South Carolina with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country. Thank you. It’s a phenomenal crowd, only topped by the number of people outside that didn’t get in. If anybody would like to give up where you’re standing or your seat, please raise your hand. All right. Then let’s begin, right? Thank you all very much though. This is great. No, they don’t get it. Down the road, they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow. They’re trying to get to a hundred, but they’re not going to make it. So I think they’re going to set up a round table. Well, that’s what they do. So people want to go to a rally, they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment. Crazy.
No, it’s crazy. Crazy! It’s a crazy deal. No, the fake news media, they’ve been trying to figure this out for years. They still don’t get it though. They don’t get it. Look at all of those cameras. Look at all of those cameras. That’s a lot of cameras. That’s a lot of cameras, Lindsey and Tim, that’s a lot of… They heard you guys were here. They heard Tim was here and that Lindsey was here and that… And they said, “We’re not going to attend that rally,” but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen, they’re here, great congressmen. But this is an incredible time for our nation. We’re thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the Great American Comeback and that’s what it is. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, factories are returning, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military. Our country is stronger than ever before.
We are stronger, we are better, but while we are building a great future, the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down. They have spent the last three years, and I can even go further than that, three years since the election, but we go before the election, working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy. But with your help, we have exposed the far left’s corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let’s see what happens in the coming months. Let’s watch. Let’s just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, “How’s President Trump doing?” They go, “Oh, not good, not good.” They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We’re doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. It’s okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000, that’s a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t, but think of it. You hear 35 and 40,000 people and we’ve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode. CNN fake news and the camera just went off, the camera. The camera just went off. Turn it back on. Hey, by the way, hold it. Look at this, and honestly, all events are like this. It’s about us. It’s all about us. I wish they’d take the camera, show the arena please. They never do. They never do. They never do it. They never show the arena. You can hear it because when you hear it, that’s not 200 people. That’s not a hundred people. That’s thousands and thousands of people including people outside. You can hear it. They always show my face. See that face? They show my face. I want them to show the arena, not my face, right? How many have you been to? How many rallies have you gone?
Practically every one. Can you believe it? I’m sure your husbands are thrilled, right? They’re thrilled. Where are you going tonight? I’m going to another Trump rally. Cool. Number 114. What do your husbands say about that? This group up here. She said, “We don’t care.” Thank you. Thank you. Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job with what we have to work with. It’s incredible. The Democrats want us to fail so badly. Even if their actions, and you take a look, hurt the people of this country, they’ll hurt the people themselves, their wealth, their everything. They’re willing to hurt our country in order to say bad, even if they know it’s not so. We made an unbelievable deal with Mexico, with Canada, with China, with South Korea, with Japan. And if you put a microphone with these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be, not anymore. Best movie of the year. It’s made in South Korea. What’s that all about? I’m waiting to see the best movie of the year-
And it’s made… He said, “It’s garbage.” Only in South Carolina can you say that. Only in South Carolina. You’re going to get us in trouble. No, I’m just repeating what he said for the fake news. No, but seriously the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings. Do you know why? Because they started attacking us and we don’t believe in it anymore. That’s why. No, but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea. They make enough stuff for us, right? And they’re good. They’re our friends. Take advantage of us, that’s okay. Not so much anymore. We are really, you take a look, magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world. We’re prepared for the absolute worst. You have to be prepared for the worst, but hopefully it will all amount to very little. That’s why I tell you when we have the flu with 35,000 people and this one we have to take it very, very seriously. That’s what we’re doing. We are preparing for the worst.
My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States. We are ready. We are ready. Totally ready. On January 31st, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States. An action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody’s complimenting me saying, “Thank you very much. You were 100% correct.” Could’ve been a whole different story. But I say, so let’s get this right. A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes, and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right? It’s Donald Trump’s fault. No, just things that happened.
But you know what this does show you? Things happen. Whoever thought of this two weeks ago? Who would’ve thought this could be going on four weeks ago? You wouldn’t. But things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it. And my guys that we have the best professionals in the world, the best in the world and we are so ready. At the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We had a quarantine some people. They weren’t happy, they weren’t happy about it. I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy, but after two weeks they got happy. You know who got happy? The people around them got happy. That’s who got happy.
I also created a White House virus task force. It’s a big thing, a virus task force. I requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need. The Democrats said, “That’s terrible. He’s doing the wrong thing. He needs eight and a half billion, not two and a half.” I’ve never had that before. I ask for two and a half, they want to give me eight and a half, so I said, “I’ll take it.” Does that make me a bad… I’ll take it. I’ll take it. I never had that before. I never had it. We want two and a half million. That’s plenty. We demand you take eight and a half. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. We want eight and a half. These people are crazy. We must understand that border security is also health security. And you’ve all seen the wall has gone up like magic. It’s gone up like magic. You think that was an easy one? That was not an easy one. It’s going up great and we’re up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security, water, everything.
This is everything they wanted, 132 miles already. We’ll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime. One of the reasons the numbers are so good. We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country. We have no choice. Whether it’s the virus that we’re talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus, you see it. You see it with the coronavirus. You see that. When you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, it’s not the only thing that comes in through the border. And we’re setting records now at the border. We’re setting records. And now just using this, so important, right? So important. I’m doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the United States. We’ve got phenomenal numbers. No, it’s true. The worst presidential harassment in history.
We had a great event yesterday, an event that was so beautiful, young African American leaders. One of the things I asked them, and I’ve been thinking about this for a long time… And great people, great people. Some of them are here tonight. Do you like the name African American or Black? And they said, “Black!” all at the same time. No, true. I tell you. Because you say, “African American or Black?” And they said almost immediately, “Black.” But we had an incredible group of people and what happened is NBC… It was such a love fest. It was so incredible. It went on for 45 minutes. It was a love fest. It was incredible. NBC turned down… There they are right there. They turned down… Comcast, which owns NBC… Actually NBC, I think, we call it MSDNC, right? MSDNC. But NBC I think is worse than CNN. I actually do. And Comcast, a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image… I’ll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible. They are terrible. They’re a terrible group of people.
And they paid me a fortune for years for the Apprentice. They paid me a fortune. And when I left the show, it was doing great. When I left the show, 14 seasons, think of that, they got a big movie star. I won’t tell you his name. Nobody would know. Actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time. But the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had Trump. But the country in five years from now, of course you want to upset them, five years or nine years or 13 years. Or 18 years! 10 more years. Nah. Oh, they go crazy when you say it. When you say to them five more years, so it’s five, but you then say maybe nine, maybe 13, maybe 17, maybe 21, or not, maybe 21. Let’s do this. Let’s term limit ourselves at 25 years. No more than 25 years. No more. Okay. They’ll pass something in the Senate. Tim, pass it in the Senate with Lindsey, a 25 year term limit please.
No, we’re looking to do a great job. We need that extra five to get everything solidified. It’s like you take a tree and you plant it, it needs some time to grab on, right? And that’s what we need. We’ve got incredible things that we’ve done. We have things we still can do, but we have done actually much, much more than we even promised we’d do. If you think over [inaudible 00:22:07. While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with these vile hoaxes, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We added another 225,000 jobs last month alone. And that makes seven million jobs since our election, seven million. The unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina. You ever hear of that place?
Now Sleepy Joe would say, “The unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio…” No, no. You’re in South Carolina. Joe! Joe, you’re in South Carolina. Come up. You ever see the guy with the note, “No, no, it’s South Carolina! It’s not Ohio.” Okay. Then he goes, “All right, Iowa. Did you say Iowa?” No. No. They did that seven times. If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right? Be the end of the road. They’d say Trump has lost it. They like to say that anyway, I guess though. These people are bad people. Now, Sleepy Joe. Well, he’s running tomorrow. No, but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes, which are unbelievable? Every speech. I actually said the other night, I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns. I said, “That’s a horrible thing. That’s the end of his evening. That’s the end of his political career.” And then after the debate, they’re revealing him and they said, “Joe Biden had a great night last night.” I don’t get it, Tim. The unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2.3%, the lowest rate in your state’s history. The lowest rate in all of America. It’s the lowest rate in all of America. I said to a friend of mine, a Democrat, “How’s the race going tomorrow? Who’s going to win?” And he says, “Mr. President…” No, it’s very interesting. He said something. This guy’s a real political pro too, in all fairness, even though he’s a Democrat. But I said, “Who’s going to win?” He said, “Honestly, sir, it doesn’t matter. You are so far ahead in South Carolina that it’s meaningless.” Meaningless. That’s what they say. And in North Carolina too. In North Carolina.
We’ve destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al Baghdadi is dead. He’s dead! He’s dead! And we recently took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. But as we keep on winning Washington, Democrats keep on losing their minds. They’ve gone crazy. The good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates. Whether it’s this character that nobody ever heard of him. I’d never heard it. I thought I knew all the wealthy people. This guy Tom, Mr. Impeachment, how did that work out, Tom Hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa, right? Millions. He got less than 1%. He got one third of 1%. I wrote a little note. Did you see it? It said, “Tom, it’s not so easy doing what I did. Is it?” Not so easy. Not so easy.
All you have to do is ask Mini Mike. He’s in there for a fortune. He wished he never started. Mini Mike, he wished he never started. He said, “Well, Trump can do it. I’m going to do it too.” Unfortunately it’s not working out too well. Was that the worst debate performance in history? They had a big audience. Everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what we’re supposed to be doing up here. He turned out to be a total catastrophe. 35 million people, can you believe that? That’s a big audience. Very big. And what a killer. But this guy Steyer, he spends all this money. He’s not that wealthy. He spends all of this money and you shouldn’t waste your vote on him tomorrow. I have to be honest. By the way, are the Republicans allowed to vote anyway even though… Are you ready? You ready? Let’s do it together. I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint, I assume. Lindsey, Tim, our great congressmen, are we allowed to do this? So am I allowed to request… First we-
Congressman, are we allowed to do this? Am I allowed to request … First, we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against President Trump. And then if it’s legal, I always say if it’s permissible by law, because they have so many little booby traps, but they only like getting the Republicans. Democrats skirt, right? But we’ll see what happens about that. The Democrats. But let me ask you this. Lindsey, Tim, you’re pros. These are two of the greatest guys I know. So let me ask you this.
So I don’t know what the record attendance is in this arena, but I was told that we broke it by a lot. And you got the people outside. Are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for? Because you’re allowed to skip. All right, so wait a minute, let’s do a poll. We do this for the fake news back there. Ready? Who would be the best candidate for us? Not for them. We’re ready. Ready? So let’s go through them just quickly. We won’t include Steyer because he’s a loser. He’s out, okay? We won’t include him. Who would be the best? This is a real poll. This isn’t one of those fake polls taken by … In all fairness, I love you, Fox, taken by Fox, the worst pollster. This guy … this pollster hates Trump’s guts. I was losing the last election by a fortune. They said, “He did great with women.” Everything was wrong. And they never replaced this guy. But watch this. You ready?
So first we’ll go … let’s say sleepy Joe, right? Right? Then we’ll go crazy Bernie. Then we’ll go mini Mike. I think he’s out of it. Should we include mini Mike or not? Mini Mike is gone. Mini Mike is gone. I think he’s gone. He doesn’t have a chance. So let’s not talk … and he’s not in your election anyways, so let’s forget. So mini Mike, I hear mini Mike, by the way, has left. He’s basically given up. That’s what I hear. He gave up. He gave up. Now, I hope what I just said keeps him in. You know, he’s the kind of a guy, he’ll stay in because, “I don’t want to be wrong.” Mike, it’s time to go home. Go home, Mike, and enjoy your life. Go home and spend some money on something.
So let’s just go … okay. Do you agree we’ll go for the two … Look, Pocahontas, we can forget about her, right? Pocahontas. They said, “She’s not dumb, but she’s just damn mean. We can’t vote for her.” She’s a mean one. She is mean. So Pocahontas, should we leave her in or out?
How about Klobuchar? Not going to happen. So really we’re down to two candidates, right? Sleepy Joe Biden and crazy Bernie. So this is a poll. I guarantee you this. As much as they hate me, they hate me. They’re going to put this all over the place. We have a poll of like 30,000 people inside and out. They’re doing it outside, too. We have a poll. Are you ready?
Who do I … So in other words, who’s the weaker of the two? I’m not interested in who does better. No, no. I’m not interested … wait. Ready? In other words, who do I want to run against? Meaning … very simple. We put it into nice, simple language. Who the hell is easier to beat? So who is easier for us? Not me. For us to beat. Ready? Crazy Bernie? Or sleepy Joe? I don’t know. I think maybe a crazy Bernie has it a little bit. Once more just quick. Ready?
He said, “It doesn’t matter, you’ll beat them all.”
I hope so. I hope so. So who is easier to beat, crazy Bernie or sleepy Joe? They think Bernie’s easier to beat. They think Bernie’s easier to beat. So whether it’s Bernie Sanders’ plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Warren’s plan. I told you that I had more Indian blood in me than her, even though I have none. I have none. Zero. I have none. I have none. I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has. And she choked. She said, “I’m going to show. I’m going to show.” She hired this company and they went out and did a blood test. 1,024th, right? So that means I probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago.
I’m telling you, that was horrible. She choked. We don’t want a person to win that chokes. We don’t want to choke artist, right? One thing you will say about me, I’m not a choker. With all these people for years, they’re after me years. We can’t have chokers. We can’t have chokers as your president. So Elizabeth Warren’s plan to eliminate America’s borders. That’s what she would … or mini Mike’s plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns. How about that? Mini Mike wants to take away your guns. The insanity of the Democrat party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great new Republican party. This November, we are going to take back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House.
I wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people. Seriously. I wonder what they say. They never talk about it. They’ll say, “Joe Biden had a fabulous crowd today.” Fabulous. So fabulous that there’s like five people. And they’ll leave and they’ll say, “President Trump had a smattering of applause.” Smattering. They use the word smattering a lot. This is not … let’s let them hear it. This is not a … this is a big … this is not a smattering. It’s not a smattering. Turn the cameras. That’s not a smattering. That is not a smattering.
I hate it. They say Donald Trump … In India, I hate to say this to you, but … so they actually have 129,000 seat stadium. Did you see it? The place was packed, and they did better than most. They gave me credit for 100,000. That was not bad. It’s 129. The stadium holds 100. They had a field that’s about three times … it’s cricket. It’s the biggest stadium. And they had 129. I was with the Prime Minister of India, Modi. Great guy, loved by the people of India. And we had an amazing thing. And I went in, and here’s the problem. This is a big crowd. And normally I like talking about my crowds because I get the crowds like nobody, but I just got back from 140 or 50 or 60,000 people and now I’m coming here. What does this place hold, 15? It’s hard to be enthused. You understand that?
I may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India. Think of this, they have 1.5 billion people. We have 350, so we’re doing pretty well, I’ll tell you what, but I love this crowd, and I love that crowd too. Tell you they have a great love for … They have a great love. They have a great leader, and they have a great love for the people of this country. That was really a worthwhile trip. With us tonight are both of your incredible US Senators. Two incredible friends, two warriors. Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, come up here. And by the way, Tim’s incredible mother is right here in the front row. As they’re doing that, they got this big … I was going to almost do a poll on the two of them, but we’re not doing that. But Lindsey is a true fighter for South Carolina. Loves your state. And as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee … you know that, right? He’s the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So important. So important. Senator Graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the Constitution as written. Lindsey was amazing, you remember, for Justice Brett Kavanaugh? Remember how badly he … Great job, Lindsey. Great job, man. Thank you.
Senator Scott is a leading superstar. He’s a superstar. But he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it. People don’t know, but in the last year, prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years. And that was with no Democrat help. If we had the help, we could lower it by 50%. But we’ll get their help. One of these days, they’re going to get smart. Senator Scott provides world class care for our veterans. What he’s done for our veterans is incredible. And bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones, including 135 right here in South Carolina. That’s what it is. Tim Scott came to my office with an idea. He said, “Opportunity zone.” I said, “Tim, what the hell is that?” What is it? Right, Tim?
And he went through a whole big thing and I said, “This maybe could work,” and we tried it. It is an incredible success, and what he’s done for this country is incredible. It’s incredible. Lindsey. We’ll start with Lindsey. Say a few words, please. Thank you.
Well, that was quite a display, wasn’t it? Now there’s a lot of love in this room. A lot of people say to me, friends of mine, they’ve very successful. They’ll say, “How do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this?” You know why? There’s such love in the room it’s easy. No, it’s true. There is such … I explained, they don’t understand it, because they’re not for doing that, but I say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it’s easy to do. Very easy. Right? It’s sort of easy to do. We’re also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state. And some of you maybe know I liked this guy for a long time, Governor Henry McMaster. Come up, Henry. Come up, Henry.
Representatives Joe Wilson, Jeff Duncan, William Timmons, Ralph Norman, Tom Rice, and the Chairman of the South Carolina Republican party, Drew McKissick.
As I introduce somebody, and I’ll just say stay there because he was brave, but he got hit hard. He’s a very special man, retired Marine Corps, major general, and most of you know he received the Congressional Medal of Honor, James E. Livingston. James, just relax. Where’s James? He got hit hard. Thank you, James. Congressional Medal of Honor winner. Thank you, James.
They are great brave people. You know, we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and they’re both the highest awards. One civilian, one is military. I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off, I’ll read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honors, many are not living, to be honest with you. And I’ll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill, hit 19 times by gunfire, grabbing four people, bringing them down, getting onto a helicopter, falling out of the helicopter, hitting a tree on the way down. Hitting a tree. They went back and saved him, but he died later. I mean, those are tough deals. Those are tough deals. We have one right here who’s living. We have one right here who’s living. But they are tough. So thank you very much for being here. And maybe I could ask our governor, our great governor of this incredible state, to say a few words. Please, Henry.
Thank you very much. And where’s Alan? Is your son here? You’re great son, Attorney General? Alan, thank you very much. Take good care of him, okay? Thank you. Thank you, Alan. And thanks to Republicans all over America. We are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible. Since my election, over 121,000 new jobs have been created right here in South Carolina. We’ve lifted 10 million people off welfare, including 7 million off of food stamps. And that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. They’re working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they’re making much more money and it costs our country nothing. We make money, they pay taxes. It’s a whole different deal.
Median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country. The unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. How about that one? It’s a good one. That’s a good one. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached record lows. Black youth unemployment has reached an all time low. Black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.
For decades, Democrat politicians betrayed African-Americans. They forced their children into failing schools. They shipped their jobs to foreign countries. They pushed their unfair sentencing policies. You know about Alice? You know Alice? And they favored illegal aliens over their own constituents. You know that. That’s been happening for a long time. My administration is reversing these failed policies and delivering record gains for African-Americans. We are going to compete for every single vote in 2020, and we expect to win a historic share of the black vote come election day. We are supporting working families by fighting paid … we got something that nobody thought could happen: Paid family leave. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 more in their pocket thanks to the Republican Child Tax Credit. Republican, not Democrat. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country. For years, politicians sold you out to global special interests, enriching other countries at your expense. That ended. That ended. But I am not the president of the globe. I don’t want to be the president of the world. I am the president of the United States of America.
Last month, we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe, and I signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. The USMCA is a tremendous, giant, beautiful victory for South Carolina farmers, ranchers, manufacturers all across the state. Nothing like it, what you had to go through with NAFTA. Everybody was leaving. It was a disgrace that it was ever signed. You know it better than anybody. You had those empty hopes all over the country, all over this state. All around the world, we are demanding trade that is fair and my all time favorite word: reciprocal. Reciprocal. Got to be fair.
After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. We are finally putting America first. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you, the American taxpayer. They want to treat illegal aliens, people that come into our country illegally, better than they want to treat our military and our veterans. Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it threatens innocent lives. I recently invited to the White House the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped, beaten, brutalized, and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in New York City.
Here in Charleston County, an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade. In Berkeley County, officers captured a previously deported MS-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire. And he should have never been in our country. He shouldn’t have been allowed.
It’s being built.
It’s being built.
By the way, just in case you haven’t heard, it is being built. That, you know. And they’re going to go nuts. They’re going to go nuts. They thought they got me. They said, “Okay.” Have you heard them recently? “Okay. He’s building the wall.” And you think it’s easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep State and some never-Trumpers? They’re a dying breed though. The good thing, they’re on respirator. They’re on respirator. They’re on mouth to mouth resuscitation. You can do it. I’m not doing it. They’re on mouth to mouth resuscitation, the never-Trumpers. But you think it’s easy. It’s not. But that’s been built. But you know what they say now. “Okay. He’s building the wall, but Mexico’s not paying for it.” Yes they are, actually. They are. They are. They are paying for it.
And some of the fake news knows that, but they refuse to report it, but that’s okay. You’ll see. You’ll see what’s going on. And I want to thank Mexico because, by the way, right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border. We have Mexico protecting our border. And they only do that for Trump. They don’t do that for sleepy Joe. They don’t do that for crazy Bernie. And they don’t do it for mini Mike, that’s for sure. They’re only doing that for Trump, right? 27,000 soldiers protecting our border. In this region …
… thousand soldiers protecting our border. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE … They’ve been treated so badly, right? They are great. They’re brave. They’re tough. Any men? There are tough guys in here, but anybody want to be an ICE officer? It’s tough stuff, right? They go into those nests. They call them nest. That’s where these guys get together and they knock the hell. I mean, if they have to … I have to be very careful. I don’t want to get them in trouble, because the press wants us to be very politically correct. So let me change it around. They go into a nest of MS13, and they say, “Oh, hello gentlemen. How are you?” On occasion, they have a fight. They never lose those fights. We need people like that. “Hello gentleman. How are you? How many people did you kill last year? How many people did you get kill last year with a knife,” because they like knives because it’s more painful. This is the kind of people that we were letting into our country. ICE has taken them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands.
Last year, ICE officers arrested 12,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape and many for a thing called murder. On Wednesday we won the big case in federal court. Did you see that? Did you see that? We won the case unanimously. Unanimously. Federal appeals court, where we don’t have to give money to sanctuary cities and States if they don’t work with us, finally. Finally. Finally. Why should we?
Yet the Democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens. They want unfettered catch and release. We have ended that program. It was not easy. We have to go through courts. Everything is a court. Everything is a suit. We do anything. We turn to the right, they sue us. We turn to the left, they sue us. We win. But we’re winning. We have 218 judges now. It’s good. Let me just preface that by saying I know they give fair opinions. It bears no relationship to who appoints them, but I never win with an Obama appointed judge ever. I don’t win. No, we have great judges going onto the courts. Great judges. They’re fair judges. They’re judges that truly love our constitution. It’s great.
They’re judges that if we feel it’s right, they don’t want to invite the world to trespass across our borders. Very simple. The democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens. You know that. You’ve been reading. All you have to do is pick up a paper every day. They release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities. We don’t do that anymore. We won’t let it happen, and now we don’t have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they’re going to want. It’s a whole game changer.
They don’t even want to report it. “I don’t know. I didn’t see much.” They keep talking about the virus. “Oh, the virus. Is Trump doing a good job? Oh, I don’t think so. Gee, I don’t think so.” Chucky Schumer: “I don’t think he’s doing a good job.” This guy doesn’t know he’s alive. Oh, what bad people. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.
Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring, and we have ended catch and release permanently. You know what catching release is? We catch them, we grab them. We say, “Could we please have your address?” “Address? I don’t know what the hell is an address?” They don’t have an address. “Could we have a number? Do you have a phone? Could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court.” What they do is they catch him, they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives, and it’s one of those things in many cases, and then release. We release him into our country. We don’t do that anymore. If you knew what it took …
We catch them, and we take some information and we release them in, and we say, “Please report back in four years from now for your trial.” About 2% come back, and they’re the ones that are the dumbest people I’ve ever seen. 2%. Nobody comes back. It’s crazy, but we’re getting a change. It would be so easy. They call it loopholes. Loopholes. That word alone, they call it loopholes. It would be so easy if we had some democrat support. We don’t have any Democrat support. They want open borders. They don’t care about crime. Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year. We have deported record numbers of gang members. We are building the wall faster than ever, and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day.
Washington democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders’ healthcare takeover. They want to take away your healthcare. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security. That’s what’s going to happen. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice. Remember when President Obama would say, “You can keep your doctor. You could keep your plan.” 28 times. He said, “You can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan.” Well, he lied. We should impeach him. We should impeach him for that. He lied 28 times. “You’ll keep your doctor, keep your plan. It’s wonderful. Great.” Went through the roof. We’re doing a great job.
We killed the individual mandate, which is the most unbelievable, horrible. It’s not really Obamacare anymore, but we’re running the hulk of it and we’re trying to kill it entirely, and then we will put it back. You’ll have great health care, and preexisting conditions will be totally protected. Preexisting conditions will be totally protected. We’re making healthcare better and much cheaper. While premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office, we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old Obamacare. Think of that and better. And better.
We are stopping surprise medical billing, a disgrace. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency, because when providers are required to show their prices, which they don’t have to do, but now they do, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. They’re just as good. I always like a name brand. I mean, there’s something. There’s no difference. Probably sometimes they’re better. We’ve totally transformed veteran’s healthcare, getting long ought VA choice and VA accountability passed after 50 years.
Hopefully nobody in this great arena needs it, but we have passed something that they said couldn’t happen: the spectacular right to try. You know what that is? If you’re terminally ill, you go all over the world. If you have no money, you can’t. You go home and you die. You’re terminally ill. They go all over the world. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe. They’re searching. We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world, greatest technicians in the world, and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems. Now, you sign a piece of paper. We’re not going to hold anybody liable. You get to use that drug, and the results have been unbelievable. Unbelievable.
Hopefully you don’t need it, but now we have right to try. They’ve been trying for 51 years to get that approved. 51 years, and we got it approved. I guess I’m good at getting things approved, aren’t I? Those people that I brought up here where the reason too, every one of them. They were incredible. Thank you. Thank you. Senators, Congressman, they were the reasons.
We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years. We have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease, which is a big deal. Kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it’s so much work. They die from overwork. It’s just crazy. In theory, they could keep them going for a long time, but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do. We’ve done things that make it so much easier, and it’s just such an honor to be involved. Also, Alzheimer’s disease, we’re really making strides. It’s really a great thing. Great thing.
we’re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America’s youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and of course the late, great Abraham Lincoln.
Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are a big tent. We are a big party. We are the party of big ideas for the future. This is where it is. This is where it is. this is not the old Republican Party. This is a very inclusive party. This is a great party. Republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice, including right here in South Carolina. We want to give school choice to every child in America who needs it, from kindergarten to 12th grade, because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.
I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. That’s a big deal. This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party. They came to me, a group of people, and they wanted criminal justice reform. I wasn’t sure about the issue, but we had a lot of great Republicans, very much in favor of it, including people that happen to be right here today. They were very much, and I started studying the issue, worked hard on the issue, and criminal justice reform. You saw Alice Johnson come out of prison. 22 years. She had another 20 years left. Think of it. For a phone call. For a phone call. A great woman, but we have many people coming out that shouldn’t be there for anywhere near those terms. Not for those terms.
But they came to see me, a group. A group of people came. Van Jones, he came up. “Oh, thank you, sir.” They needed four senators. They needed help. I called Lindsey, I called everybody. I called Tim, who’s so great on everything. I called everybody. They needed four senators and maybe five, and they needed help with some of the ones that weren’t moving in the right direction. I gave it to them, and I got it, and it was not easy. We get criminal justice reform, and then I signed it. Then this Van Jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all. They say, “Van Jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform.” I called our great first lady over. I said, “Darling, please take a look. It’s going to be so nice, because honestly, look, they couldn’t have done even close without me.” I got all these people together, got them done. It was impossible. Previous presidents couldn’t even think about it. They couldn’t even think about doing it, and they tried, although I don’t think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it.
So he gets up, and he starts by saying, “I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton. I knew Al when he was very heavy. He looked better when he was heavy. It’s true. He’s one of the few people, he really looked better when he was heavy. He looked much better when he was heavy. I’ve got to tell him. I have to explain, because I know him very well. He would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president, but he can’t admit it on television.” But he called and he said, “I want to take the Reverend Al Sharpton,” and then name after name after name of people that I never heard of. My wife said, “Are they going to think about you, right? Are they going to think about you?” I said, “Darling, of course.” I said, “He’s saving me til the end, because I was by far.” It’s true. This is true, Tim. Lindsay, this is true.
I said, “He’s saving me til the end. It’s going to be such an honor to be recognized, because I don’t get enough publicity. I need a little bit more.” He got to the end and he didn’t say it, and she looked at me. She sort of smiled. I think she loved it in a certain way. But she sort of smiled. She said, “That’s too bad.” I said, “Yeah, it is.” Then he said, “I have one more thing to say. We must get out this year and fight and vote against this President of the United States.” Can you believe that? It’s true? It’s a true story. Van Jones. These are just terrible that they could … I was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady, but I’ll live through it somehow.
I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years. 52 years that Golan Heights had been fighting and fighting for it. I did it, and I did the true capital, Jerusalem, right? How many presidents promise that? Every president for many, many decades promised we’re going to do that. They never did it. I did it. We did a lot. We’ve invested more than $2 trillion in the United States military, including more than $150 million this year in Joint Base Charleston, Fort Jackson, and Paris Island. We created the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the Space Force. We have another branch. 72 years. Not for 72 years, the Air Force, have they done a new branch. We did the Space Force.
When I first said it, everybody thought I was joking. I said, “I’m not joking.” They thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies. I said, “No, it’s all about space.” In a number of years, people are going to say, “I can’t believe we didn’t do this sooner.” We need a little vision. We need a little foresight. You know what? I mentioned Space Force. At arenas like this, it gets one of the biggest hands, because that’s where it’s at. That’s where it’s going, unfortunately, or fortunately. We needed it for defense. We needed it for offense. Sixth branch. 72 years. For years, we watched as your politicians apologize for America.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of South Carolina. At stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation. I really believe that it’s the survival. You see these maniacs that we’re dealing with. They want to give away everything. We will end up being Venezuela large scale version. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, to secure, then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in November of 2020, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the swamp. I never thought it was this deep.
Man. I talked about a swamp. You never told me it was this bad, fellas. That swamp is bad. You got dirty cops at the top of the FBI. You got a lot of dirty people, but you also have phenomenal people in the FBI and other places, but we’re draining that swamp. I never knew it was going to be this dirty, and we’re getting a lot of help from a lot of great people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening. Think of it. From poverty to prosperity. Look at some of the stories that you have over there. Look at some of the incredible stories. Look at Tim Scott. Look at that incredible story. No, really. It’s an incredible story. Lindsay will say it.
I give about 99% of the credit to Tim Scott’s mother. I do. I guarantee you, Tim, there was no games, right? There was no games in your household. It was let’s go to work, right? Great mother. Thank you very much. Thank you. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system finally of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, infectious diseases like we’re working on right now, and ending the AIDS epidemic. Nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years, and it should have been started before. We will end the AIDS epidemic. Who would have thought we could have done that?
We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have to land on moon, and then you go to Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag, and we live by the words of our national motto, “In God we trust.”
From Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head to right here in Charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. It’s true. It’s true. True. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day.
Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
You have the best year ever on record, right? Southeast, best year you’ve ever had, right? You have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year you’ve ever had, but some people in South Carolina are getting a little tired, I’m surprised to hear this, of winning. I’ve very surprised to hear this. Some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, “Senator Scott, Senator Lindsay Graham, we’re tired of winning and South Carolina. Can’t do it anymore. It’s too much. It’s too much. We’ve had years where we weren’t winning, and it was okay. We couldn’t get jobs. We took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us. We want you to say, ‘Mr. President, South Carolina is tired of winning. We don’t want to win anymore. We are tired, sick, tired of winning.'”
They’re going to come in and say, “Sir, I hate to tell you, but the people of South Carolina don’t want to win anymore.” I’ll say, “Mr. Senators, let me tell you something. South Carolina does want to win. They want to win more than anybody, and we’re not going to change a thing, because we’re winning like never before. You know what? We’re going to keep it that way. Sorry, senators. Go back to South Carolina, senators.” Go back to South Carolina, because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of South Carolina, the best is yet to come.
The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come, because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Thank you, South Carolina. Thank you.
","Donald Trump Charleston, South Carolina Rally Transcript – February 28, 2020",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-charleston-south-carolina-rally-transcript-february-28-2020
John Stokes,United Kingdom,2020-04-21,"It seems quite a long time now since I heard the Gracious Speech read over six hours ago. Apart from the excellent speech of the leader of my party, my main recollection of all the other speeches I have heard is of their length. I hope that in my case I can speak to the point and not perhaps at such excessive length.
I found it hard to reconcile the complacent tone of the Gracious Speech with the state of affairs in the country today. I wish to speak with extreme seriousness for a few moments, quite broadly, on the present state of our country. There was no recognition in the Gracious Speech that the nation is demoralised and that our proud national spirit is to some extent diminished. Nor have the Government brought forward any new measures to fulfil their fundamental duty to defend the realm and maintain law and order in our land.
The second paragraph of the Gracious Speech reads:
“My Government will continue to safeguard the nation’s security and make a full contribution to the North Atlantic Alliance”.
I do not believe that the Government are continuing to safeguard the nation’s security to anything like the extent that they should, nor do I believe that they are making “a full contribution” to NATO. We know this from the complaints that we have heard from Dr. Luns and others.
Some weeks ago I was with our forces in Germany. As everyone knows, they are short of almost every kind of equipment, notably tanks and aircraft, but also vehicles. Many of those which they have are older than the men who drive them. The forces are also short of arms, ammunition and petrol for exercises and manoeuvres. Even more disgraceful, we found that in many units the soldiers were short of certain mundane articles such as boots, socks, and jerseys.
The troops feel that they are to some extent neglected, and I am afraid that this is true. All ranks have lost faith in the Government. That is a deeply serious matter. They have no confidence that they will be paid properly. I have never come across such bitterness, not only among the serving men but among their wives. Yet now we hear that there is to be yet another defence review and that still more cuts in our defences are envisaged.
Our forces may soon be reduced to the size of those of a small country such as Denmark or Belgium. In spite of these serious deficiencies, I am glad to say that I found the morale of our troops high. I am certain that this is due to the inspired leadership of the officers, warrant officers ​ and NCOs—leadership which, in my view, is far above that which we see in all walks of civilian life.
Turning to the situation at home, the Gracious Speech says on the second page:
“My Government will seek to ensure that respect for the law is maintained, and will give full support to strengthening the Police Service.”
Yet, as we all know, there is probably more violence now in this country than at any time since the fearful disturbances of the Middle Ages.
Violent crime, including the most distressing crime of rape, continually increases. Many people in my constituency—and I know that this is general throughout many towns in England—are fearful of leaving their homes at night.
Protection by the police of private property against burglary or theft has almost broken down, and respect for authority and for the law has woefully diminished. There is general lack of discipline in the community. Vandalism and thuggery continue in many of our towns. The situation in our prisons is clearly dangerous and getting out of hand. Meanwhile, the Home Secretary does nothing. He hardly even wrings his hands. I doubt whether he could keep order in a nursery.
On the economic scene, we observe a Government presided over by a Prime Minister and a Chancellor of the Exchequer who have seen both prices and unemployment double since 1974. If anyone had prophesied that situation in 1974, he would have been considered a dangerous lunatic. But I believe that there will be no escaping these trends for the nation as long as this Government remain in office.
Production and productivity are still appallingly low, and unless the situation is improved rapidly there is nothing to prevent the nation from becoming the poorest in Europe. I have recently been in France and Germany. As more and more people now realise, they are increasingly drawing ahead of us in prosperity. One can see it in many ways. When one returns to this country, one’s first feeling is “My goodness, what a poor, shabby nation we have become,” starting at our railway stations, getting into our dirty trains and seeing our dirty streets in London or ​ Birmingham or many of our big towns. If we cannot even keep our trains and streets and public places clean, there is clearly a decline of very serious proportions.
The conduct of foreign affairs is, after defence and law and order, one of the most important functions of government. As the House knows, I am a student and lover of English history. I am sorry to say so, but I believe that under our present Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs the nation has reached its lowest point in esteem in many centuries. The Government seem to have ceased to believe in us and in our nation. Yet, if we do not stand up for ourselves, no one else—neither the EEC nor any other nation, and certainly not the United Nations—will stand up for us. What strikes one so forcefully in France is that every Frenchman puts France first, second and third on the list. Do we really think that our Government have the same feeling towards our beloved country?
In Rhodesia, where I was a few weeks ago, we have the extraordinary and, I believe, almost unprecedented spectacle of our Foreign Office supporting terrorists who have been trained by the Cubans and armed by the Russians. These are the people who are being backed by our Government, particularly by our Foreign Secretary, against the interim Government of Rhodesia composed of blacks and whites. No doubt there are reasons of State for that. No doubt it is not just wishy-washy sentimentality. No doubt this is meant to placate America, which has always hated the British Empire, has never had the slightest idea of how to handle black people, and which certainly can teach us nothing. It may also be an attempt to placate Nigeria and some of the black countries in Africa. But if we do not respect ourselves as a nation, and look after our own people in Rhodesia, no black nation and no black people will have any respect whatever for us.
I therefore very much hope that next week, when these grave matters come before this Chamber, my party will have the courage of its convictions, above all, listen increasingly to what most people in England are saying and vote determinedly against the continuation of sanctions.
Finally, we see in education an attempt to devalue examinations and to water ​ down everything of merit. Under this Government, the country is rapidly losing its way, its sense of direction and its sense of purpose. If this goes on, I believe that we shall end up as a sort of second rate Socialist State with lower and lower standards and, of course, less and less freedom. The Government seem quite unaware of the grave deterioration which has taken place, certainly since 1974 and probably earlier. The sooner we have a General Election, the better.
I noticed a poll in the West Midlands today—and I have some interest in that part of the country—which put my party 18 per cent. ahead. I am not surprised. That is a feeling which I have had all along. I am certain that if an election were held in the next few weeks, we should, at least in England, gain a substantial majority, and then the task of national recovery will have to begin.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-09-21,"I’m going to Ohio. Things seem to be very good. We have been doing very well with the China virus, but they’ve had pretty big spike in Europe as you know, in UK in particular. And I’m sure they’ll have that under control, hopefully soon, but we’re in very good shape. The vaccines are coming along. I just got a report. The vaccines are coming along rapidly. Therapeutics are coming along very well and we’ll see what happens, but too bad about Europe, too bad.
I would say on Friday or Saturday, I’ll be announcing the pick. Five women are being looked at and vetted very carefully. Five, and we’ll make a decision probably Saturday, but Friday, or Saturday.
Yeah, I will.
During this period of time.
I don’t know. I doubt it.
I doubt it,, but we’ll meet with a few, probably.
Say it.
I have.
I have. Today and yesterday, day before.
Well, I’d much rather have a vote before the election, because there’s a lot of work to be done and I’d much rather have it. We have plenty of time to do it. There’s really a lot of time. So, let’s say I make the announcement on Saturday. There’s a great deal of time before the election. That’ll be up to Mitch and the Senate, but I’d certainly much rather have the vote. I think it sends a good signal and it’s solidarity and lots of other things. And I’m just doing my constitutional obligation. I have an obligation to do this, so I would rather see it before the election.
We’ll have to see. I would think that that would be very bad for them. I think their voters, the people that voted them, put them there because of a certain ideology, or a certain feel. And they don’t want to have somebody do that. I think it’s very bad if they do that.
Yeah, it just sounds to me like it would be somebody else. I don’t believe… It could be. It could be, and it might not be too. It was just too convenient.
No concern, I just think it would be better. They asked would I rather have it. I’d rather have it before the election. I think it would be better for our country and we’ll pick somebody that’s outstanding, very qualified. They’re all qualified, but somebody that is outstanding and I’d rather see it all take place before the election. So before November 3rd.
No, I don’t think so. No, I think we’re going to win. If you look at the polls, the real polls, we’re doing very well. We’re going to Ohio tonight. We’re packed. We’re packed everywhere. There’s never been, we’ve never had spirit like we have now. Even four years ago, the spirit now is greater even than it was four years ago.
I did. I just did it, just there. My message is a strong message on China. And basically you’ll see it, you’ll see it tomorrow, but I just did it a little while ago.
I have one, or two that I have in mind.
Say it.
We’ll talk about that at another time.
One of the people that’s very respected, but they’re all respected. She’s certainly one of the candidates. Yes.
I may, she’s highly thought of. And I’m getting a lot of phone calls from a lot of people. She has a lot of support. I don’t know it, but I hear she’s outstanding.
And she’s one of the people we’re looking at.
Well, I think they are, but that’s up to DOJ. That will be up to the attorney general. But certainly they are. If you look at Portland, you look at what’s going on there. What a mess. Go ahead. And we could straighten it out. All Democrats, all radical lefts, we could straighten it out so fast. Go ahead.
That’s working its way through. I give it a preliminary okay. They will work at two great companies, Oracle and Walmart. Now Larry Ellison’s a great genius at that kind of thing. The technology is incredible. And so if we can save it, we’ll save it. And if we can’t, we’ll cut it off. But they have preliminary. We’ll see what they could do. We have to have total security. That’s the only thing. Very important. We have to have total security. I’ll see you in Ohio. Thank you.
",Donald Trump Transcript September 21: Wants SCOTUS Vote Before Election,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-transcript-september-21-wants-scotus-vote-before-election
Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-08-25,"My fellow Americans. I had the profound honor this week of addressing American troops at Fort Myer, and speaking to thousands of veterans at the American Legion National Convention. Today, I want to speak to all Americans about what we can learn from the men and women of our incredible Armed Forces.
Every person who puts on the uniform makes our nation proud. They all come from across our land. They represent every race, ethnicity and creed. But they all pledge the same oath, fight the same cause, and operate as one team with one shared sense of purpose.
They love their families. They cherish their freedom. They salute our flag, and above all they believe in America. Now, we must draw inspiration from their love and loyalty to one another and to our nation.
As we seek to heal divisions from within, we must also remember what our service personnel know better than anyone: that we are one people, with one home, and one glorious American destiny.
We come from all different walks of life, but we all share the same dream: to live in peace and safety, to work with honor and dignity, and to build a better future for those we love.
Together we can achieve this dream, but we must first remember who we are and the values that bind us together. We must speak out against the voices that try to sow hatred and division. We must treat our fellow citizens with love and affection, and we must honor our heroes and prove worthy of the sacrifice they've made.
For all of us, I ask every American to make a simple promise to the courageous warriors who fight in our name: when they come home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of loyalty that unite us together as one.
Only when we work together with a shared purpose will we carry on the proud tradition of those who came before us. Only when we honor our history will we have confidence in our few, and only when we strive for peace among one another will we remain a force for peace all around the world.
We can achieve this peace. We can foster this unity, and we can rebuild this loyalty because together we are truly one nation under God. Thank you. God bless you.
","Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-weekly-address-august-25-2017
Grover Cleveland,United States of America,1886-12-06 00:00:00,"To the Congress of the United States: In discharge of a constitutional duty, and following a well-established precedent in the Executive office, I herewith transmit to the Congress at its reassembling certain information concerning the state of the Union, together with such recommendations for legislative consideration as appear necessary and expedient. Our Government has consistently maintained its relations of friendship toward all other powers and of neighborly interest toward those whose possessions are contiguous to our own. Few questions have arisen during the past year with other governments, and none of those are beyond the reach of settlement in friendly counsel. We are as yet without provision for the settlement of claims of citizens of the United States against Chile for injustice during the late war with Peru and Bolivia. The mixed commissions organized under claims conventions concluded by the Chilean Government with certain European States have developed an amount of friction which we trust can be avoided in the convention which our representative at Santiago is authorized to negotiate. The cruel treatment of inoffensive Chinese has, I regret to say, been repeated in some of the far Western States and Territories, and acts of violence against those people, beyond the power of the local constituted authorities to prevent and difficult to punish, are reported even in distant Alaska. Much of this violence can be traced to race prejudice and competition of labor, which can not, however, justify the oppression of strangers whose safety is guaranteed by our treaty with China equally with the most favored nations. In opening our vast domain to alien elements the purpose of our lawgivers was to invite assimilation, and not to provide an arena for endless antagonism. The paramount duty of maintaining public order and defending the interests of our own people may require the adoption of measures of restriction, but they should not tolerate the oppression of individuals of a special race. I am not without assurance that the Government of China, whose friendly disposition toward us I am most happy to recognize, will meet us halfway in devising a comprehensive remedy by which an effective limitation of Chinese emigration, joined to protection of those Chinese subjects who remain in this country, may be secured. Legislation is needed to execute the provisions of our Chinese convention of 1880 touching the opium traffic. While the good will of the Colombian Government toward our country is manifest, the situation of American interests on the Isthmus of Panama has at times excited concern and invited friendly action looking to the performance of the engagements of the two nations concerning the territory embraced in the interoceanic transit. With the subsidence of the Isthmian disturbances and the erection of the State of Panama into a federal district under the direct government of the constitutional administration at Bogota, a new order of things has been inaugurated, which, although as yet somewhat experimental and affording scope for arbitrary exercise of power by the delegates of the national authority, promises much improvement. The sympathy between the people of the United States and France, born during our colonial struggle for independence and continuing today, has received a fresh impulse in the successful completion and dedication of the colossal statue of ""Liberty Enlightening the World"" in New York Harbor--the gift of Frenchmen to Americans. A convention between the United States and certain other powers for the protection of submarine cables was signed at Paris on March 14, 1884, and has been duly ratified and proclaimed by this Government. By agreement between the high contracting parties this convention is to go into effect on the 1st of January next, but the legislation required for its execution in the United States has not yet been adopted. I earnestly recommend its enactment. Cases have continued to occur in Germany giving rise to much correspondence in relation to the privilege of sojourn of our naturalized citizens of German origin revisiting the land of their birth, yet I am happy to state that our relations with that country have lost none of their accustomed cordiality. The claims for interest upon the amount of tonnage dues illegally exacted from certain German steamship lines were favorably reported in both Houses of Congress at the last session, and I trust will receive final and favorable action at an early day. The recommendations contained in my last annual message in relation to a mode of settlement of the fishery rights in the waters of British North America, so long a subject of anxious difference between the United States and Great Britain, was met by an adverse vote of the Senate on April 13 last, and thereupon negotiations were instituted to obtain an agreement with Her Britannic Majesty's Government for the promulgation of such joint interpretation and definition of the article of the convention of 1818 relating to the territorial waters and inshore fisheries of the British Provinces as should secure the Canadian rights from encroachment by the United States fishermen and at the same time insure the enjoyment by the latter of the privileges guaranteed to them by such convention. The questions involved are of long standing, of grave consequence, and from time to time for nearly three-quarters of a century have given rise to earnest international discussions, not unaccompanied by irritation. Temporary arrangements by treaties have served to allay friction, which, however, has revived as each treaty was terminated. The last arrangement, under the treaty of 1871, was abrogated after due notice by the United States on June 30, 1885, but I was enabled to obtain for our fishermen for the remainder of that season enjoyment of the full privileges accorded by the terminated treaty. The joint high commission by whom the treaty had been negotiated, although invested with plenary power to make a permanent settlement, were content with a temporary arrangement, after the termination of which the question was relegated to the stipulations of the treaty of 1818, as to the first article of which no construction satisfactory to both countries has ever been agreed upon. The progress of civilization and growth of population in the British Provinces to which the fisheries in question are contiguous and the expansion of commercial intercourse between them and the United States present to-day a condition of affairs scarcely realizable at the date of the negotiations of 1818.New and vast interests have been brought into existence; modes of intercourse between the respective countries have been invented and multiplied; the methods of conducting the fisheries have been wholly changed; and all this is necessarily entitled to candid and careful consideration in the adjustment of the terms and conditions of intercourse and commerce between the United States and their neighbors along a frontier of over 3,500 miles. This propinquity, community of language and occupation, and similarity of political and social institutions indicate the practicability and obvious wisdom of maintaining mutually beneficial and friendly relations. Whilst I am unfeignedly desirous that such relations should exist between us and the inhabitants of Canada, yet the action of their officials during the past season toward our fishermen has been such as to seriously threaten their continuance. Although disappointed in my efforts to secure a satisfactory settlement of the fishery question, negotiations are still pending, with reasonable hope that before the close of the present session of Congress announcement may be made that an acceptable conclusion has been reached. As at an early day there may be laid before Congress the correspondence of the Department of State in relation to this important subject, so that the history of the past fishing season may be fully disclosed and the action and the attitude of the Administration clearly comprehended, a more extended reference is not deemed necessary in this communication. The recommendation submitted last year that provision be made for a preliminary reconnoissance of the conventional boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia is renewed. I express my unhesitating conviction that the intimacy of our relations with Hawaii should be emphasized. As a result of the reciprocity treaty of 1875, those islands, on the highway of Oriental and Australasian traffic, are virtually an outpost of American commerce and a stepping-stone to the growing trade of the Pacific. The Polynesian Island groups have been so absorbed by other and more powerful governments that the Hawaiian Islands are left almost alone in the enjoyment of their autonomy, which it is important for us should be preserved. Our treaty is now terminable on one year's notice, but propositions to abrogate it would be, in my judgment, most ill advised. The paramount influence we have there acquired, once relinquished, could only with difficulty be regained, and a valuable ground of vantage for ourselves might be converted into a stronghold for our commercial competitors. I earnestly recommend that the existing treaty stipulations be extended for a further term of seven years. A recently signed treaty to this end is now before the Senate. The importance of telegraphic communication between those islands and the United States should not be overlooked. The question of a general revision of the treaties of Japan is again under discussion at Tokyo. As the first to open relations with that Empire, and as the nation in most direct commercial relations with Japan, the United States have lost no opportunity to testify their consistent friendship by supporting the just claims of Japan to autonomy and independence among nations. A treaty of extradition between the United States and Japan, the first concluded by that Empire, has been lately proclaimed. The weakness of Liberia and the difficulty of maintaining effective sovereignty over its outlying districts have exposed that Republic to encroachment. It can not be forgotten that this distant community is an offshoot of our own system, owing its origin to the associated benevolence of American citizens, whose praiseworthy efforts to create a nucleus of civilization in the Dark Continent have commanded respect and sympathy everywhere, especially in this country. Although a formal protectorate over Liberia is contrary to our traditional policy, the moral right and duty of the United States to assist in all proper ways in the maintenance of its integrity is obvious, and has been consistently announced during nearly half a century. I recommend that in the reorganization of our Navy a small vessel, no longer found adequate to our needs, be presented to Liberia, to be employed by it in the protection of its coastwise revenues. The encouraging development of beneficial and intimate relations between the United States and Mexico, which has been so marked within the past few years, is at once the occasion of congratulation and of friendly solicitude. I urgently renew my former representation of the need or speedy legislation by Congress to carry into effect the reciprocity commercial convention of January 20, 1883.Our commercial treaty of 1831 with Mexico was terminated, according to its provisions, in 1881, upon notification given by Mexico in pursuance of her announced policy of recasting all her commercial treaties. Mexico has since concluded with several foreign governments new treaties of commerce and navigation, defining alien rights of trade, property, and residence, treatment of shipping, consular privileges, and the like. Our yet unexecuted reciprocity convention of 1883 covers none of these points, the settlement of which is so necessary to good relationship. I propose to initiate with Mexico negotiations for a new and enlarged treaty of commerce and navigation. In compliance with a resolution of the Senate, I communicated to that body on August 2 last, and also to the House of Representatives, the correspondence in the case of A. K. Cutting, an American citizen, then imprisoned in Mexico, charged with the commission of a penal offense in Texas, of which a Mexican citizen was the object. After demand had been made for his release the charge against him was amended so as to include a violation of Mexican law within Mexican territory. This joinder of alleged offenses, one within and the other exterior to Mexico, induced me to order a special investigation of the case, pending which Mr. Cutting was released. The incident has, however, disclosed a claim of jurisdiction by Mexico novel in our history, whereby any offense committed anywhere by a foreigner, penal in the place of its commission, and of which a Mexican is the object, may, if the offender be found in Mexico, be there tried and punished in conformity with Mexican laws. This jurisdiction was sustained by the courts of Mexico in the Cutting case, and approved by the executive branch of that Government, upon the authority of a Mexican statute. The appellate court in releasing Mr. Cutting decided that the abandonment of the complaint by the Mexican citizen aggrieved by the alleged crime (a libelous publication) removed the basis of further prosecution, and also declared justice to have been satisfied by the enforcement of a small part of the original sentence. The admission of such a pretension would be attended with serious results, invasive of the jurisdiction of this Government and highly dangerous to our citizens in foreign lands. Therefore I have denied it and protested against its attempted exercise as unwarranted by the principles of law and international usages. A sovereign has jurisdiction of offenses which take effect within his territory, although concocted or commenced outside of it; but the right is denied of any foreign sovereign to punish a citizen of the United States for an offense consummated on our soil in violation of our laws, even though the offense be against a subject or citizen of such sovereign. The Mexican statute in question makes the claim broadly, and the principle, if conceded, would create a dual responsibility in the citizen and lead to inextricable confusion, destructive of that certainty in the law which is an essential of liberty. When citizens of the United States voluntarily go into a foreign country, they must abide by the laws there in force, and will not be protected by their own Government from the consequences of an offense against those laws committed in such foreign country; but watchful care and interest of this Government over its citizens are not relinquished because they have gone abroad, and if charged with crime committed in the foreign land a fair and open trial, conducted with decent regard for justice and humanity, will be demanded for them. With less than that this Government will not be content when the life or liberty of its citizens is at stake. Whatever the degree to which extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction may have been formerly allowed by consent and reciprocal agreement among certain of the European States, no such doctrine or practice was ever known to the laws of this country or of that from which our institutions have mainly been derived. In the case of Mexico there are reasons especially strong for perfect harmony in the mutual exercise of jurisdiction. Nature has made us irrevocably neighbors, and wisdom and kind feeling should make us friends. The overflow of capital and enterprise from the United States is a potent factor in assisting the development of the resources of Mexico and in building up the prosperity of both countries. To assist this good work all grounds of apprehension for the security of person and property should be removed; and I trust that in the interests of good neighborhood the statute referred to will be so modified as to eliminate the present possibilities of danger to the peace of the two countries. The Government of the Netherlands has exhibited concern in relation to certain features of our tariff laws, which are supposed by them to be aimed at a class of tobacco produced in the Dutch East Indies. Comment would seem unnecessary upon the unwisdom of legislation appearing to have a special national discrimination for its object, which, although unintentional, may give rise to injurious retaliation. The establishment, less than four years ago, of a legation at Teheran is bearing fruit in the interest exhibited by the Shah's Government in the industrial activity of the United States and the opportunities of beneficial interchanges. Stable government is now happily restored in Peru by the election of a constitutional president, and a period of rehabilitation is entered upon; but the recovery is necessarily slow from the exhaustion caused by the late war and civil disturbances. A convention to adjust by arbitration claims of our citizens has been proposed and is under consideration. The naval officer who bore to Siberia the testimonials bestowed by Congress in recognition of the aid given to the Jeannette survivors has successfully accomplished his mission. His interesting report will be submitted. It is pleasant to know that this mark of appreciation has been welcomed by the Russian Government and people as befits the traditional friendship of the two countries. Civil perturbations in the Samoan Islands have during the past few years been a source of considerable embarrassment to the three Governments-Germany, Great Britain, and the United States--whose relations and extraterritorial rights in that important group are guaranteed by treaties. The weakness of the native administration and the conflict of opposing interests in the islands have led King Malietoa to seek alliance or protection in some one quarter, regardless of the distinct engagements whereby no one of the three treaty powers may acquire any paramount or exclusive interest. In May last Malietoa offered to place Samoa under the protection of the United States, and the late consul, without authority, assumed to grant it. The proceeding was promptly disavowed and the overzealous official recalled. Special agents of the three Governments have been deputed to examine the situation in the islands. With a change in the representation of all three powers and a harmonious understanding between them, the peace, prosperity, autonomous administration, and neutrality of Samoa can hardly fail to be secured. It appearing that the Government of Spain did not extend to the flag of the United States in the Antilles the full measure of reciprocity requisite under our statute for the continuance of the suspension of discriminations against the Spanish flag in our ports, I was constrained in October last to rescind my predecessor's proclamation of February 14, 1884, permitting such suspension. An arrangement was, however, speedily reached, and upon notification from the Government of Spain that all differential treatment of our vessels and their cargoes, from the United States or from any foreign country, had been completely and absolutely relinquished, I availed myself of the discretion conferred by law and issued on the 27th of October my proclamation declaring reciprocal suspension in the United States. It is most gratifying to bear testimony to the earnest spirit in which the Government of the Queen Regent has met our efforts to avert the initiation of commercial discriminations and reprisals, which are ever disastrous to the material interests and the political good will of the countries they may affect. The profitable development of the large commercial exchanges between the United States and the Spanish Antilles is naturally an object of solicitude. Lying close at our doors, and finding here their main markets of supply and demand, the welfare of Cuba and Puerto Rico and their production and trade are scarcely less important to us than to Spain. Their commercial and financial movements are so naturally a part of our system that no obstacle to fuller and freer intercourse should be permitted to exist. The standing instructions of our representatives at Madrid and Havana have for years been to leave no effort unessayed to further these ends, and at no time has the equal good desire of Spain been more hopefully manifested than now. The Government of Spain, by removing the consular tonnage fees on cargoes shipped to the Antilles and by reducing passport fees, has shown its recognition of the needs of less trammeled intercourse. An effort has been made during the past year to remove the hindrances to the proclamation of the treaty of naturalization with the Sublime Porte, signed in 1874, which has remained inoperative owing to a disagreement of interpretation of the clauses relative to the effects of the return to and sojourn of a naturalized citizen in the land of origin. I trust soon to be able to announce a favorable settlement of the differences as to this interpretation. It has been highly satisfactory to note the improved treatment of American missionaries in Turkey, as has been attested by their acknowledgments to our late minister to that Government of his successful exertions in their behalf. The exchange of ratifications of the convention of December 5, 1885, with Venezuela, for the reopening of the awards of the Caracas Commission under the claims convention of 1866, has not yet been effected, owing to the delay of the Executive of that Republic in ratifying the measure. I trust that this postponement will be brief; but should it much longer continue, the delay may well be regarded as a rescission of the compact and a failure on the part of Venezuela to complete an arrangement so persistently sought by her during many years and assented to by this Government in a spirit of international fairness, although to the detriment of holders of bona fide awards of the impugned commission. I renew the recommendation of my last annual message that existing legislation concerning citizenship and naturalization be revised. We have treaties with many states providing for the renunciation of citizenship by naturalized aliens, but no statute is found to give effect to such engagements, nor any which provides a needed central bureau for the registration of naturalized citizens. Experience suggests that our statutes regulating extradition might be advantageously amended by a provision for the transit across our territory, now a convenient thoroughfare of travel from one foreign country to another, of fugitives surrendered by a foreign government to a third state. Such provisions are not unusual in the legislation of other countries, and tend to prevent the miscarriage of justice. It is also desirable, in order to remove present uncertainties, that authority should be conferred on the Secretary of State to issue a certificate, in case of an arrest for the purpose of extradition, to the officer before whom the proceeding is pending, showing that a requisition for the surrender of the person charged has been duly made. Such a certificate, if required to be received before the prisoner's examination, would prevent a long and expensive judicial inquiry into a charge which the foreign government might not desire to press. I also recommend that express provision be made for the immediate discharge from custody of persons committed for extradition where the President is of opinion that surrender should not be made. The drift of sentiment in civilized communities toward full recognition of the rights of property in the creations of the human intellect has brought about the adoption by many important nations of an international copyright convention, which was signed at Berne on the 18th of September, 1885.Inasmuch as the Constitution gives to the Congress the power ""to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries,"" this Government did not feel warranted in becoming a signatory pending the action of Congress upon measures of international copyright now before it; but the right of adhesion to the Berne convention hereafter has been reserved. I trust the subject will receive at your hands the attention it deserves, and that the just claims of authors, so urgently pressed, will be duly heeded. Representations continue to be made to me of the injurious effect upon American artists studying abroad and having free access to the art collections of foreign countries of maintaining a discriminating duty against the introduction of the works of their brother artists of other countries, and I am induced to repeat my recommendation for the abolition of that tax. Pursuant to a provision of the diplomatic and consular appropriation act approved July 1, 1886, the estimates submitted by the Secretary of State for the maintenance of the consular service have been recast on the basis of salaries for all officers to whom such allowance is deemed advisable. Advantage has been taken of this to redistribute the salaries of the offices now appropriated for, in accordance with the work performed, the importance of the representative duties of the incumbent, and the cost of living at each post. The last consideration has been too often lost sight of in the allowances heretofore made. The compensation which may suffice for the decent maintenance of a worthy and capable officer in a position of onerous and representative trust at a post readily accessible, and where the necessaries of life are abundant and cheap, may prove an inadequate pittance in distant lands, where the better part of a year's pay is consumed in reaching the post of duty, and where the comforts of ordinary civilized existence can only be obtained with difficulty and at exorbitant cost. I trust that in considering the submitted schedules no mistaken theory of economy will perpetuate a system which in the past has virtually closed to deserving talent many offices where capacity and attainments of a high order are indispensable, and in not a few instances has brought discredit on our national character and entailed embarrassment and even suffering on those deputed to uphold our dignity and interests abroad. In connection with this subject I earnestly reiterate the practical necessity of supplying some mode of trustworthy inspection and report of the manner in which the consulates are conducted. In the absence of such reliable information efficiency can scarcely be rewarded or its opposite corrected. Increasing competition in trade has directed attention to the value of the consular reports printed by the Department of State, and the efforts of the Government to extend the practical usefulness of these reports have created a wider demand for them at home and a spirit of emulation abroad. Constituting a record at the changes occurring in trade and of the progress of the arts and invention in foreign countries, they are much sought for by all interested in the subjects which they embrace. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury exhibits in detail the condition of the public finances and of the several branches of the Government related to his Department. I especially direct the attention of the Congress to the recommendations contained in this and the last preceding report of the Secretary touching the simplification and amendment of the laws relating to the collection of our revenues, and in the interest of economy and justice to the Government I hope they may be adopted by appropriate legislation. The ordinary receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, were $336,439,727.06. Of this amount $192,905,023.41 was received from customs and $116,805,936.48 from internal revenue. The total receipts, as here stated, were $13,749,020.68 greater than for the previous year, but the increase from customs was $11,434,084.10 and from internal revenue $4,407,210.94, making a gain in these items for the last year of $15,841,295.04, a falling off in other resources reducing the total increase to the smaller amount mentioned. The expense at the different custom-houses of collecting this increased customs revenue was less than the expense attending the collection of such revenue for the preceding year by $490,608, and the increased receipts of internal revenue were collected at a cost to the Internal-Revenue Bureau $155,944.99 less than the expense of such collection for the previous year. The total ordinary expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, were $242,483,138.50, being less by $17,788,797 than such expenditures for the year preceding, and leaving a surplus in the Treasury at the close of the last fiscal year of $93,956,588.56, as against $63,463,771.27 at the close of the previous year, being an increase in such surplus of $30,492,817.29.The expenditures are compared with those of the preceding fiscal year and classified as follows: For the current year to end June 30, 1887, the ascertained receipts up to October 1, 1886, with such receipts estimated for the remainder of the year, amount to $356,000,000.The expenditures ascertained and estimated for the same period are $266,000,000, indicating an anticipated surplus at the close of the year of $90,000,000.The total value of the exports from the United States to foreign countries during the fiscal year is stated and compared with the preceding year as follows: The value of some of our leading exports during the last fiscal year, as compared with the value of the same for the year immediately preceding, is here given, and furnishes information both interesting and suggestive: Our imports during the last fiscal year, as compared with the previous year, were as follows: In my last annual message to the Congress attention was directed to the fact that the revenues of the Government exceeded its actual needs, and it was suggested that legislative action should be taken to relieve the people from the unnecessary burden of taxation thus made apparent. In view of the pressing importance of the subject I deem it my duty to again urge its consideration. The income of the Government, by its increased volume and through economies in its collection, is now more than ever in excess of public necessities. The application of the surplus to the payment of such portion of the public debt as is now at our option subject to extinguishment, if continued at the rate which has lately prevailed, would retire that class of indebtedness within less than one year from this date. Thus a continuation of our present revenue system would soon result in the receipt of an annual income much greater than necessary to meet Government expenses, with no indebtedness upon which it could be applied. We should then be confronted with a vast quantity of money, the circulating medium of the people, hoarded in the Treasury when it should be in their hands, or we should be drawn into wasteful public extravagance, with all the corrupting national demoralization which follows in its train. But it is not the simple existence of this surplus and its threatened attendant evils which furnish the strongest argument against our present scale of Federal taxation. Its worst phase is the exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of the relations between the people and their Government and a dangerous departure from the rules which limit the right of Federal taxation. Good government, and especially the government of which every American citizen boasts, has for its objects the protection of every person within its care in the greatest liberty consistent with the good order of society and his perfect security in the enjoyment of his earnings with the least possible diminution for public needs. When more of the people's substance is exacted through the form of taxation than is necessary to meet the just obligations of the Government and the expense of its economical administration, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of the fundamental principles of a free government. The indirect manner in which these exactions are made has a tendency to conceal their true character and their extent. But we have arrived at a stage of superfluous revenue which has aroused the people to a realization of the fact that the amount raised professedly for the support of the Government is paid by them as absolutely if added to the price of the things which supply their daily wants as if it was paid at fixed periods into the hand of the tax gatherer. Those who toil for daily wages are beginning to understand that capital, though sometimes vaunting its importance and clamoring for the protection and favor of the Government, is dull and sluggish till, touched by the magical hand of labor, it springs into activity, furnishing an occasion for Federal taxation and gaining the value which enables it to bear its burden. And the laboring man is thoughtfully inquiring whether in these circumstances, and considering the tribute he constantly pays into the public Treasury as he supplies his daily wants, he receives his fair share of advantages. There is also a suspicion abroad that the surplus of our revenues indicates abnormal and exceptional business profits, which, under the system which produces such surplus, increase without corresponding benefit to the people at large the vast accumulations of a few among our citizens, whose fortunes, rivaling the wealth of the most favored in antidemocratic nations, are not the natural growth of a steady, plain, and industrious republic. Our farmers, too, and those engaged directly and indirectly in supplying the products of agriculture, see that day by day, and as often as the daily wants of their households recur, they are forced to pay excessive and needless taxation, while their products struggle in foreign markets with the competition of nations, which, by allowing a freer exchange of productions than we permit, enable their people to sell for prices which distress the American farmer. As every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly increasing pride of our people in American citizenship and in the glory of our national achievements and progress, a sentiment prevails that the leading strings useful to a nation in its infancy may well be to a great extent discarded in the present stage of American ingenuity, courage, and fearless self-reliance; and for the privilege of indulging this sentiment with true American enthusiasm our citizens are quite willing to forego an idle surplus in the public Treasury. And all the people know that the average rate of Federal taxation upon imports is to-day, in time of peace, but little less, while upon some articles of necessary consumption it is actually more, than was imposed by the grievous burden willingly borne at a time when the Government needed millions to maintain by war the safety and integrity of the Union. It has been the policy of the Government to collect the principal part of its revenues by a tax upon imports, and no change in this policy is desirable. But the present condition of affairs constrains our people to demand that by a revision of our revenue laws the receipts of the Government shall be reduced to the necessary expense of its economical administration; and this demand should be recognized and obeyed by the people's representatives in the legislative branch of the Government. In readjusting the burdens of Federal taxation a sound public policy requires that such of our citizens as have built up large and important industries under present conditions should not be suddenly and to their injury deprived of advantages to which they have adapted their business; but if the public good requires it they should be content with such consideration as shall deal fairly and cautiously with their interests, while the just demand of the people for relief from needless taxation is honestly answered. A reasonable and timely submission to such a demand should certainly be possible without disastrous shock to any interest; and a cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless action, often the outgrowth of impatience and delayed justice. Due regard should be also accorded in any proposed readjustment to the interests of American labor so far as they are involved. We congratulate ourselves that there is among us no laboring class fixed within unyielding bounds and doomed under all conditions to the inexorable fate of daily toil. We recognize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of the Republic, and we treat those who have it in their keeping as citizens entitled to the most careful regard and thoughtful attention. This regard and attention should be awarded them, not only because labor is the capital of our workingmen, justly entitled to its share of Government favor, but for the further and not less important reason that the laboring man, surrounded by his family in his humble home, as a consumer is vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost of living and enables him to bring within his domestic circle additional comforts and advantages. This relation of the workingman to the revenue laws of the country and the manner in which it palpably influences the question of wages should not be forgotten in the justifiable prominence given to the proper maintenance of the supply and protection of well-paid labor. And these considerations suggest such an arrangement of Government revenues as shall reduce the expense of living, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work nor reduce the compensation of American labor and injuriously affect its condition and the dignified place it holds in the estimation of our people. But our farmers and agriculturists--those who from the soil produce the things consumed by all--are perhaps more directly and plainly concerned than any other of our citizens in a just and careful system of Federal taxation. Those actually engaged in and more remotely connected with this kind of work number nearly one-half of our population. None labor harder or more continuously than they. No enactments limit their hours of toil and no interposition of the Government enhances to any great extent the value of their products. And yet for many of the necessaries and comforts of life, which the most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes, and for their implements of husbandry, they are obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit, which by the action of the Government is given to the more favored manufacturer. I recommend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the increasing and unnecessary surplus of national income annually accumulating be released to the people by an amendment to our revenue laws which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported materials as by American labor may be manufactured into marketable commodities. Nothing can be accomplished, however, in the direction of this much-needed reform unless the subject is approached in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the interests of the entire country and with a willingness to yield something for the public good. The sum paid upon the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, was $44,551,043.36.During the twelve months ended October 31,1886, 3 per cent bonds were called for redemption amounting to $127,283,100, of which $80,643,200 was so called to answer the requirements of the law relating to the sinking fund and $46,639,900 for the purpose of reducing the public debt by application of a part of the surplus in the Treasury to that object. Of the bonds thus called $102,269,450 became subject under such calls to redemption prior to November 1, 1886. The remainder, amounting to$25,013,650, matured under the calls after that date. In addition to the amount subject to payment and cancellation prior to November 1, there were also paid before that day certain of these bonds, with the interest thereon, amounting to $5,072,350, which were anticipated as to their maturity, of which $2,664,850 had not been called, Thus $107,341,800 had been actually applied prior to the 1st of November, 1886, to the extinguishment of our bonded and interest-bearing debt, leaving on that day still outstanding the sum of $1,153,443,112. Of this amount $86,848,700 were still represented by 3 per cent bonds. They however, have been since November 1, or will at once be, further reduced by $22,606,150, being bonds which have been called, as already stated, but not redeemed and canceled before the latter date. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, there were coined, under the compulsory silver-coinage act of 1878,29,838,905 silver dollars, and the cost of the silver used in such coinage was $23,448,960.01. There had been coined up to the close of the previous fiscal year under the provisions of the law 203,882,554 silver dollars, and on the 1st day of December, 1886, the total amount of such coinage was $247,131,549.The Director of the Mint reports that at the time of the passage of the law of 1878 directing this coinage the intrinsic value of the dollars thus coined was 94 1/4 cents each, and that on the 31st day of July, 1886, the price of silver reached the lowest stage ever known, so that the intrinsic or bullion price of our standard silver dollar at that date was less than 72 cents. The price of silver on the 30th day of November last was such as to make these dollars intrinsically worth 78 cents each. These differences in value of the coins represent the fluctuations in the price of silver, and they certainly do not indicate that compulsory coinage by the Government enhances the price of that commodity or secures uniformity in its value. Every fair and legal effort has been made by the Treasury Department to distribute this currency among the people. The withdrawal of United States Treasury notes of small denominations and the issuing of small silver certificates have been resorted to in the endeavor to accomplish this result, in obedience to the will and sentiments of the representatives of the people in the Congress. On the 27th day of November, 1886, the people held of these coins, or certificates representing them, the nominal sum of $166,873,041, and we still had $79,464,345 in the Treasury as against about $142,894,055 so in the hands of the people and $72,865,376 remaining in the Treasury one year ago. The Director of the Mint again urges the necessity of more vault room for the purpose of storing these silver dollars which are not needed for circulation by the people. I have seen no reason to change the views expressed in my last annual message on the subject of this compulsory coinage, and I again urge its suspension on all the grounds contained in my former recommendation, reenforced by the significant increase of our gold exportations during the last year, as appears by the comparative statement herewith presented, and for the further reasons that the more this currency is distributed among the people the greater becomes our duty to protect it from disaster, that we now have abundance for all our needs, and that there seems but little propriety in building vaults to store such currency when the only pretense for its coinage is the necessity of its use by the people as a circulating medium. The great number of suits now pending in the United States courts for the southern district of New York growing out of the collection of customs revenue at the port of New York and the number of such suits that are almost daily instituted are certainly worthy the attention of the Congress. These legal controversies, based upon conflicting views by importers and the collector as to the interpretation of our present complex and indefinite revenue laws, might be largely obviated by an amendment of those laws. But pending such amendment the present condition of this litigation should be relieved. There are now pending about 2,500 of these suits. More than 1,100 have been commenced within the past eighteen months, and many of the others have been at issue for more than twenty-five years. These delays subject the Government to loss of evidence and prevent the preparation necessary to defeat unjust and fictitious claims, while constantly accruing interest threatens to double the demands involved. In the present condition of the dockets of the courts, well filled with private suits, and of the force allowed the district attorney, no greater than is necessary for the ordinary and current business of his office, these revenue litigations can not be considered. In default of the adoption by the Congress of a plan for the general reorganization of the Federal courts, as has been heretofore recommended, I urge the propriety of passing a law permitting the appointment of an additional Federal judge in the district where these Government suits have accumulated, so that by continuous sessions of the courts devoted to the trial of these cases they may be determined. It is entirely plain that a great saving to the Government would be accomplished by such a remedy, and the suitors who have honest claims would not be denied justice through delay. The report of the Secretary of War gives a detailed account of the administration of his Department and contains sundry recommendations for the improvement of the service, which I fully approve. The Army consisted at the date of the last consolidated return of 2,103 officers and 24,946 enlisted men. The expenses of the Department for the last fiscal year were $36,990,903.38, including $6,294,305.43 for public works and river and harbor improvements. I especially direct the attention of the Congress to the recommendation that officers be required to submit to an examination as a preliminary to their promotion. I see no objection, but many advantages, in adopting this feature, which has operated so beneficially in our Navy Department, as well as in some branches of the Army. The subject of coast defenses and fortifications has been fully and carefully treated by the Board on Fortifications, whose report was submitted at the last session of Congress; but no construction work of the kind recommended by the board has been possible during the last year from the lack of appropriations for such purpose. The defenseless condition of our seacoast and lake frontier is perfectly palpable. The examinations made must convince us all that certain of our cities named in the report of the board should be fortified and that work on the most important of these fortifications should be commenced at once. The work has been thoroughly considered and laid out, the Secretary of War reports, but all is delayed in default of Congressional action. The absolute necessity, judged by all standards of prudence and foresight, of our preparation for an effectual resistance against the armored ships and steel guns and mortars of modern construction which may threaten the cities on our coasts is so apparent that I hope effective steps will be taken in that direction immediately. The valuable and suggestive treatment of this question by the Secretary of War is earnestly commended to the consideration of the Congress. In September and October last the hostile Apaches who, under the leadership of Geronimo, had for eighteen months been on the war path, and during that time had committed many murders and been the cause of constant terror to the settlers of Arizona, surrendered to General Miles, the military commander who succeeded General Crook in the management and direction of their pursuit. Under the terms of their surrender as then reported, and in view of the understanding which these murderous savages seemed to entertain of the assurances given them, it was considered best to imprison them in such manner as to prevent their ever engaging in such outrages again, instead of trying them for murder. Fort Pickens having been selected as a safe place of confinement, all the adult males were sent thither and will be closely guarded as prisoners. In the meantime the residue of the band, who, though still remaining upon the reservation, were regarded as unsafe and suspected of furnishing aid to those on the war path, had been removed to Fort Marion. The women and larger children of the hostiles were also taken there, and arrangements have been made for putting the children of proper age in Indian schools. The report of the Secretary of the Navy contains a detailed exhibit of the condition of his Department, with such a statement of the action needed to improve the same as should challenge the earnest attention of the Congress. The present Navy of the United States, aside from the ships in course of construction, consists of--First. Fourteen single-turreted monitors, none of which are in commission nor at the present time serviceable. The batteries of these ships are obsolete, and they can only be relied upon as auxiliary ships in harbor defense, and then after such an expenditure upon them as might not be deemed justifiable. Second. Five fourth-rate vessels of small tonnage, only one of which was designed as a war vessel, and all of which are auxiliary merely. Third. Twenty-seven cruising ships, three of which are built of iron, of small tonnage, and twenty-four of wood. Of these wooden vessels it is estimated by the Chief Constructor of the Navy that only three will be serviceable beyond a period of six years, at which time it may be said that of the present naval force nothing worthy the name will remain. All the vessels heretofore authorized are under contract or in course of construction except the armored ships, the torpedo and dynamite boats, and one cruiser. As to the last of these, the bids were in excess of the limit fixed by Congress. The production in the United States of armor and gun steel is a question which it seems necessary to settle at an early day if the armored war vessels are to be completed with those materials of home manufacture. This has been the subject of investigation by two boards and by two special committees of Congress within the last three years. The report of the Gun Foundry Board in 1884, of the Board on Fortifications made in January last, and the reports of the select committees of the two Houses made at the last session of Congress have entirely exhausted the subject, so far as preliminary investigation is involved, and in their recommendations they are substantially agreed. In the event that the present invitation of the Department for bids to furnish such of this material as is now authorized shall fail to induce domestic manufacturers to undertake the large expenditures required to prepare for this new manufacture, and no other steps are taken by Congress at its coming session, the Secretary contemplates with dissatisfaction the necessity of obtaining abroad the armor and the gun steel for the authorized ships. It would seem desirable that the wants of the Army and the Navy in this regard should be reasonably met, and that by uniting their contracts such inducement might be offered as would result in securing the domestication of these important interests. The affairs of the postal service show marked and gratifying improvement during the past year. A particular account of its transactions and condition is given in the report of the Postmaster-General, which will be laid before you. The reduction of the rate of letter postage in 1883, rendering the postal revenues inadequate to sustain the expenditures, and business depression also contributing, resulted in an excess of cost for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1885, of eight and one-third millions of dollars. An additional check upon receipts by doubling the measure of weight in rating sealed correspondence and diminishing one-half the charge for newspaper carriage was imposed by legislation which took effect with the beginning of the past fiscal year, while the constant demand of our territorial development and growing population for the extension and increase of mail facilities and machinery necessitates steady annual advance in outlay, and the careful estimate of a year ago upon the rates of expenditure then existing contemplated the unavoidable augmentation of the deficiency in the last fiscal year by nearly $2,000,000. The anticipated revenue for the last year failed of realization by about $64,000, but proper measures of economy have so satisfactorily limited the growth of expenditure that the total deficiency in fact fell below that of 1885, and at this time the increase of revenue is in a gaining ratio over the increase of cost, demonstrating the sufficiency of the present rates of postage ultimately to sustain the service. This is the more pleasing because our people enjoy now both cheaper postage proportionably to distances and a vaster and more costly service than any other upon the globe. Retrenchment has been effected in the cost of supplies, some expenditures unwarranted by law have ceased, and the outlays for mail carriage have been subjected to beneficial scrutiny. At the close of the last fiscal year the expense of transportation on star routes stood at an annual rate of cost less by over $560,000 than at the close of the previous year and steamboat and mail-messenger service at nearly $200,000 less. The service has been in the meantime enlarged and extended by the establishment of new offices, increase of routes of carriage, expansion of carrier-delivery conveniences, and additions to the railway mail facilities, in accordance with the growing exigencies of the country and the long-established policy of the Government. The Postmaster-General calls attention to the existing law for compensating railroads and expresses the opinion that a method may be devised which will prove more just to the carriers and beneficial to the Government; and the subject appears worthy of your early consideration. The differences which arose during the year with certain of the ocean steamship companies have terminated by the acquiescence of all in the policy of the Government approved by the Congress in the postal appropriation at its last session, and the Department now enjoys the utmost service afforded by all vessels which sail from our ports upon either ocean--a service generally adequate to the needs of our intercourse. Petitions have, however, been presented to the Department by numerous merchants and manufacturers for the establishment of a direct service to the Argentine Republic and for semimonthly dispatches to the Empire of Brazil, and the subject is commended to your consideration. It is an obvious duty to provide the means of postal communication which our commerce requires, and with prudent forecast of results the wise extension of it may lead to stimulating intercourse and become the harbinger of a profitable traffic which will open new avenues for the disposition of the products of our industry. The circumstances of the countries at the far south of our continent are such as to invite our enterprise and afford the promise of sufficient advantages to justify an unusual effort to bring about the closer relations which greater freedom of communication would tend to establish. I suggest that, as distinguished from a grant or subsidy for the mere benefit of any line of trade or travel, whatever outlay may be required to secure additional postal service, necessary and proper and not otherwise attainable, should be regarded as within the limit of legitimate compensation for such service. The extension of the free-delivery service as suggested by the Postmaster-General has heretofore received my sanction, and it is to be hoped a suitable enactment may soon be agreed upon. The request for an appropriation sufficient to enable the general inspection of fourth-class offices has my approbation. I renew my approval of the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that another assistant be provided for the Post-Office Department, and I invite your attention to the several other recommendations in his report. The conduct of the Department of Justice for the last fiscal year is fully detailed in the report of the Attorney-General, and I invite the earnest attention of the Congress to the same and due consideration of the recommendations therein contained. In the report submitted by this officer to the last session of the Congress he strongly recommended the erection of a penitentiary for the confinement of prisoners convicted and sentenced in the United States courts, and he repeats the recommendation in his report for the last year. This is a matter of very great importance and should at once receive Congressional action. United States prisoners are now confined in more than thirty different State prisons and penitentiaries scattered in every part of the country. They are subjected to nearly as many different modes of treatment and discipline and are far too much removed from the control and regulation of the Government. So far as they are entitled to humane treatment and an opportunity for improvement and reformation, the Government is responsible to them and society that these things are forthcoming. But this duty can scarcely be discharged without more absolute control and direction than is possible under the present system. Many of our good citizens have interested themselves, with the most beneficial results, in the question of prison reform. The General Government should be in a situation, since there must be United States prisoners, to furnish important aid in this movement, and should be able to illustrate what may be practically done in the direction of this reform and to present an example in the treatment and improvement of its prisoners worthy of imitation. With prisons under its own control the Government could deal with the somewhat vexed question of convict labor, so far as its convicts were concerned, according to a plan of its own adoption, and with due regard to the rights and interests of our laboring citizens, instead of sometimes aiding in the operation of a system which causes among them irritation and discontent. Upon consideration of this subject it might be thought wise to erect more than one of these institutions, located in such places as would best subserve the purposes of convenience and economy in transportation. The considerable cost of maintaining these convicts as at present, in State institutions, would be saved by the adoption of the plan proposed, and by employing them in the manufacture of such articles as were needed for use by the Government quite a large pecuniary benefit would be realized in partial return for our outlay. I again urge a change in the Federal judicial system to meet the wants of the people and obviate the delays necessarily attending the present condition of affairs in our courts. All are agreed that something should be done, and much favor is shown by those well able to advise to the plan suggested by the Attorney-General at the last session of the Congress and recommended in my last annual message. This recommendation is here renewed, together with another made at the same time, touching a change in the manner of compensating district attorneys and marshals; and the latter subject is commended to the Congress for its action in the interest of economy to the Government, and humanity, fairness, and justice to our people. The report of the Secretary of the Interior presents a comprehensive summary of the work of the various branches of the public service connected with his Department, and the suggestions and recommendations which it contains for the improvement of the service should receive your careful consideration. The exhibit made of the condition of our Indian population and the progress of the work for their enlightenment, notwithstanding the many embarrassments which hinder the better administration of this important branch of the service, is a gratifying and hopeful one. The funds appropriated for the Indian service for the fiscal year just passed, with the available income from Indian land and trust moneys, amounting in all to $7,850,775.12, were ample for the service under the conditions and restrictions of laws regulating their expenditure. There remained a balance on hand on June 30, 1886, of $1,660,023.30, of which $ 1,337,768.21 are permanent funds for fulfillment of treaties and other like purposes, and the remainder, $322,255.09, is subject to be carried to the surplus fund as required by law. The estimates presented for appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year amount to $5,608,873.64, or $442,386.20 less than those laid before the Congress last year. The present system of agencies, while absolutely necessary and well adapted for the management of our Indian affairs and for the ends in view when it was adopted, is in the present stage of Indian management inadequate, standing alone, for the accomplishment of an object which has become pressing in its importance--the more rapid transition from tribal organizations to citizenship of such portions of the Indians as are capable of civilized life. When the existing system was adopted, the Indian race was outside of the limits of organized States and Territories and beyond the immediate reach and operation of civilization, and all efforts were mainly directed to the maintenance of friendly relations and the preservation of peace and quiet on the frontier. All this is now changed. There is no such thing as the Indian frontier. Civilization, with the busy hum of industry and the influences of Christianity, surrounds these people at every point. None of the tribes are outside of the bounds of organized government and society, except that the Territorial system has not been extended over that portion of the country known as the Indian Territory. As a race the Indians are no longer hostile, but may be considered as submissive to the control of the Government. Few of them only are troublesome. Except the fragments of several bands, all are now gathered upon reservations. It is no longer possible for them to subsist by the chase and the spontaneous productions of the earth. With an abundance of land, if furnished with the means and implements for profitable husbandry, their life of entire dependence upon Government rations from day to day is no longer defensible. Their inclination, long fostered by a defective system of control, is to cling to the habits and customs of their ancestors and struggle with persistence against the change of life which their altered circumstances press upon them. But barbarism and civilization can not live together. It is impossible that such incongruous conditions should coexist on the same soil. They are a portion of our people, are under the authority of our Government, and have a peculiar claim upon and are entitled to the fostering care and protection of the nation. The Government can not relieve itself of this responsibility until they are so far trained and civilized as to be able wholly to manage and care for themselves. The paths in which they should walk must be clearly marked out for them, and they must be led or guided until they are familiar with the way and competent to assume the duties and responsibilities of our citizenship. Progress in this great work will continue only at the present slow pace and at great expense unless the system and methods of management are improved to meet the changed conditions and urgent demands of the service. The agents, having general charge and supervision in many cases of more than 5,000 Indians, scattered over large reservations, and burdened with the details of accountability for funds and supplies, have time to look after the industrial training and improvement of a few Indians only. The many are neglected and remain idle and dependent, conditions not favorable for progress and civilization. The compensation allowed these agents and the conditions of the service are not calculated to secure for the work men who are fitted by ability and skill to properly plan and intelligently direct the methods best adapted to produce the most speedy results and permanent benefits. Hence the necessity for a supplemental agency or system directed to the end of promoting the general and more rapid transition of the tribes from habits and customs of barbarism to the ways of civilization. With an anxious desire to devise some plan of operation by which to secure the welfare of the Indians and to relieve the Treasury as far as possible from the support of an idle and dependent population, I recommended in my previous annual message the passage of a law authorizing the appointment of a commission as an instrumentality auxiliary to those already established for the care of the Indians. It was designed that this commission should be composed of six intelligent and capable persons--three to be detailed from the Army--having practical ideas upon the subject of the treatment of Indians and interested in their welfare, and that it should be charged, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, with the management of such matters of detail as can not with the present organization be properly and successfully conducted, and which present different phases, as the Indians themselves differ in their progress, needs, disposition, and capacity for improvement or immediate self-support. By the aid of such a commission much unwise and useless expenditure of money, waste of materials, and unavailing efforts might be avoided; and it is hoped that this or some measure which the wisdom of Congress may better devise to supply the deficiency of the present system may receive your consideration and the appropriate legislation be provided. The time is ripe for the work of such an agency. There is less opposition to the education and training of the Indian youth, as shown by the increased attendance upon the schools, and there is a yielding tendency for the individual holding of lands. Development and advancement in these directions are essential, and should have every encouragement. As the rising generation are taught the language of civilization and trained in habits of industry they should assume the duties, privileges, and responsibilities of citizenship. No obstacle should hinder the location and settlement of any Indian willing to take land in severalty; on the contrary, the inclination to do so should be stimulated at all times when proper and expedient. But there is no authority of law for making allotments on some of the reservations, and on others the allotments provided for are so small that the Indians, though ready and desiring to settle down, are not willing to accept such small areas when their reservations contain ample lands to afford them homesteads of sufficient size to meet their present and future needs. These inequalities of existing special laws and treaties should be corrected and some general legislation on the subject should be provided, so that the more progressive members of the different tribes may be settled upon homesteads, and by their example lead others to follow, breaking away from tribal customs and substituting therefor the love of home, the interest of the family, and the rule of the state. The Indian character and nature are such that they are not easily led while brooding over unadjusted wrongs. This is especially so regarding their lands. Matters arising from the construction and operation of railroads across some of the reservations, and claims of title and right of occupancy set up by white persons to some of the best land within other reservations require legislation for their final adjustment. The settlement of these matters will remove many embarrassments to progress in the work of leading the Indians to the adoption of our institutions and bringing them under the operation, the influence, and the protection of the universal laws of our country. The recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office looking to the better protection of public lands and of the public surveys, the preservation of national forests, the adjudication of grants to States and corporations and of private land claims, and the increased efficiency of the public-land service are commended to the attention of Congress. To secure the widest distribution of public lands in limited quantities among settlers for residence and cultivation, and thus make the greatest number of individual homes, was the primary object of the public-land legislation in the early days of the Republic. This system was a simple one. It commenced with an admirable scheme of public surveys, by which the humblest citizen could identify the tract upon which he wished to establish his home. The price of lands was placed within the reach of all the enterprising, industrious, and honest pioneer citizens of the country. It was soon, however, found that the object of the laws was perverted, under the system of cash sales, from a distribution of land among the people to an accumulation of land capital by wealthy and speculative persons. To check this tendency a preference right of purchase was given to settlers on the land, a plan which culminated in the general preemption act of 1841. The foundation of this system was actual residence and cultivation. Twenty years later the homestead law was devised to more surely place actual homes in the possession of actual cultivators of the soil. The land was given without price, the sole conditions being residence, improvement, and cultivation. Other laws have followed, each designed to encourage the acquirement and use of land in limited individual quantities. But in later years these laws, through vicious administrative methods and under changed conditions of communication and transportation, have been so evaded and violated that their beneficent purpose is threatened with entire defeat. The methods of such evasions and violations are set forth in detail in the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of the General Land Office. The rapid appropriation of our public lands without bona fide settlements or cultivation, and not only without intention of residence, but for the purpose of their aggregation in large holdings, in many cases in the hands of foreigners, invites the serious and immediate attention of the Congress. The energies of the Land Department have been devoted during the present Administration to remedy defects and correct abuses in the public-land service. The results of these efforts are so largely in the nature of reforms in the processes and methods of our land system as to prevent adequate estimate; but it appears by a compilation from the reports of the Commissioner of the General Land Office that the immediate effect in leading cases which have come to a final termination has been the restoration to the mass of public lands of 2,750,000 acres; that 2,370,000 acres are embraced in investigations now pending before the Department or the courts, and that the action of Congress has been asked to effect the restoration of 2,790,000 acres additional; besides which 4,000,000 acres have been withheld from reservation and the rights of entry thereon maintained. I recommend the repeal of the preemption and timber-culture acts, and that the homestead laws be so amended as to better secure compliance with their requirements of residence, improvement, and cultivation for the period of five years from date of entry, without commutation or provision for speculative relinquishment. I also recommend the repeal of the desert-land laws unless it shall be the pleasure of the Congress to so amend these laws as to render them less liable to abuses. As the chief motive for an evasion of the laws and the principal cause of their result in land accumulation instead of land distribution is the facility with which transfers are made of the right intended to be secured to settlers, it may be deemed advisable to provide by legislation some guards and checks upon the alienation of homestead rights and lands covered thereby until patents issue. Last year an Executive proclamation was issued directing the removal of fences which inclosed the public domain. Many of these have been removed in obedience to such order, but much of the public land still remains within the lines of these unlawful fences. The ingenious methods resorted to in order to continue these trespasses and the hardihood of the pretenses by which in some cases such inclosures are justified are fully detailed in the report of the Secretary of the Interior. The removal of the fences still remaining which inclose public lands will be enforced with all the authority and means with which the executive branch of the Government is or shall be invested by the Congress for that purpose. The report of the Commissioner of Pensions contains a detailed and most satisfactory exhibit of the operations of the Pension Bureau during the last fiscal year. The amount of work done was the largest in any year since the organization of the Bureau, and it has been done at less cost than during the previous year in every division. On the 30th day of June, 1886, there were 365,783 pensioners on the rolls of the Bureau. Since 1861 there have been 1,018,735 applications for pensions filed, of which 78,834 were based upon service in the War of 1812. There were 621,754 of these applications allowed, including 60,178 to the soldiers of 1812 and their widows. The total amount paid for pensions since 1861 is $808,624,811.57.The number of new pensions allowed during the year ended June 30, 1886, is 40,857, a larger number than has been allowed in any year save one since 1861. The names of 2,229 pensioners which had been previously dropped from the rolls were restored during the year, and after deducting those dropped within the same time for various causes a net increase remains for the year of 20,658 names. From January 1, 1861, to December 1, 1885, 1,967 private pension acts had been passed. Since the last-mentioned date, and during the last session of the Congress, 644 such acts became laws. It seems to me that no one can examine our pension establishment and its operations without being convinced that through its instrumentality justice can be very nearly done to all who are entitled under present laws to the pension bounty of the Government. But it is undeniable that cases exist, well entitled to relief, in which the Pension Bureau is powerless to aid. The really worthy cases of this class are such as only lack by misfortune the kind or quantity of proof which the law and regulations of the Bureau require, or which, though their merit is apparent, for some other reason can not be justly dealt with through general laws. These conditions fully justify application to the Congress and special enactments. But resort to the Congress for a special pension act to overrule the deliberate and careful determination of the Pension Bureau on the merits or to secure favorable action when it could not be expected under the most liberal execution of general laws, it must be admitted opens the door to the allowance of questionable claims and presents to the legislative and executive branches of the Government applications concededly not within the law and plainly devoid of merit, but so surrounded by sentiment and patriotic feeling that they are hard to resist. I suppose it will not be denied that many claims for pension are made without merit and that many have been allowed upon fraudulent representations. This has been declared from the Pension Bureau, not only in this but in prior Administrations. The usefulness and the justice of any system for the distribution of pensions depend upon the equality and uniformity of its operation. It will be seen from the report of the Commissioner that there are now paid by the Government 131 different rates of pension. He estimates from the best information he can obtain that 9,000 of those who have served in the Army and Navy of the United States are now supported, in whole or in part, from public funds or by organized charities, exclusive of those in soldiers' homes under the direction and control of the Government. Only 13 per cent of these are pensioners, while of the entire number of men furnished for the late war something like 20 per cent, including their widows and relatives, have been or now are in receipt of pensions. The American people, with a patriotic and grateful regard for our ex-soldiers, too broad and too sacred to be monopolized by any special advocates, are not only willing but anxious that equal and exact justice should be done to all honest claimants for pensions. In their sight the friendless and destitute soldier, dependent on public charity, if otherwise entitled, has precisely the same right to share in the provision made for those who fought their country's battles as those better able, through friends and influence, to push their claims. Every pension that is granted under our present plan upon any other grounds than actual service and injury or disease incurred in such service, and every instance of the many in which pensions are increased on other grounds than the merits of the claim, work an injustice to the brave and crippled, but poor and friendless, soldier, who is entirely neglected or who must be content with the smallest sum allowed under general laws. There are far too many neighborhoods in which are found glaring cases of inequality of treatment in the matter of pensions, and they are largely due to a yielding in the Pension Bureau to importunity on the part of those, other than the pensioner, who are especially interested, or they arise from special acts passed for the benefit of individuals. The men who fought side by side should stand side by side when they participate in a grateful nation's kind remembrance. Every consideration of fairness and justice to our ex-soldiers and the protection of the patriotic instinct of our citizens from perversion and violation point to the adoption of a pension system broad and comprehensive enough to cover every contingency, and which shall make unnecessary an objectionable volume of special legislation. As long as we adhere to the principle of granting pensions for service, and disability as the result of the service, the allowance of pensions should be restricted to cases presenting these features. Every patriotic heart responds to a tender consideration for those who, having served their country long and well, are reduced to destitution and dependence, not as an incident of their service, but with advancing age or through sickness or misfortune. We are all tempted by the contemplation of such a condition to supply relief, and are often impatient of the limitations of public duty. Yielding to no one in the desire to indulge this feeling of consideration, I can not rid myself of the conviction that if these ex-soldiers are to be relieved they and their cause are entitled to the benefit of an enactment under which relief may be claimed as a right, and that such relief should be granted under the sanction of law, not in evasion of it; nor should such worthy objects of care, all equally entitled, be remitted to the unequal operation of sympathy or the tender mercies of social and political influence, with their unjust discriminations. The discharged soldiers and sailors of the country are our fellow-citizens, and interested with us in the passage and faithful execution of wholesome laws. They can not be swerved from their duty of citizenship by artful appeals to their spirit of brotherhood born of common peril and suffering, nor will they exact as a test of devotion to their welfare a willingness to neglect public duty in their behalf. On the 4th of March, 1885, the current business of the Patent Office was, on an average, five and a half months in arrears, and in several divisions more than twelve months behind. At the close of the last fiscal year such current work was but three months in arrears, and it is asserted and believed that in the next few months the delay in obtaining an examination of an application for a patent will be but nominal. The number of applications for patents during the last fiscal year, including reissues, designs, trade-marks, and labels, equals 40,678, which is considerably in excess of the number received during any preceding year. The receipts of the Patent Office during the year aggregate $1,205,167.80, enabling the office to turn into the Treasury a surplus revenue, over and above all expenditures, of about $163,710.30.The number of patents granted during the last fiscal year, including reissues, trade-marks, designs, and labels, was 25,619, a number also quite largely in excess of that of any preceding year. The report of the Commissioner shows the office to be in a prosperous condition and constantly increasing in its business. No increase of force is asked for. The amount estimated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1886, was $890,760. The amount estimated for the year ending June 30, 1887, was $853,960. The amount estimated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888, is $778,770.The Secretary of the Interior suggests a change in the plan for the payment of the indebtedness of the Pacific subsidized roads to the Government. His suggestion has the unanimous indorsement of the persons selected by the Government to act as directors of these roads and protect the interests of the United States in the board of direction. In considering the plan proposed the sole matters which should be taken into account, in my opinion, are the situation of the Government as a creditor and the surest way to secure the payment of the principal and interest of its debt. By a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States it has been adjudged that the laws of the several States are inoperative to regulate rates of transportation upon railroads if such regulation interferes with the rate of carriage from one State into another. This important field of control and regulation having been thus left entirely unoccupied, the expediency of Federal action upon the subject is worthy of consideration. The relations of labor to capital and of laboring men to their employers are of the utmost concern to every patriotic citizen. When these are strained and distorted, unjustifiable claims are apt to be insisted upon by both interests, and in the controversy which results the welfare of all and the prosperity of the country are jeopardized. Any intervention of the General Government, within the limits of its constitutional authority, to avert such a condition should be willingly accorded. In a special message transmitted to the Congress at its last session I suggested the enlargement of our present Labor Bureau and adding to its present functions the power of arbitration in cases where differences arise between employer and employed. When these differences reach such a stage as to result in the interruption of commerce between the States, the application of this remedy by the General Government might be regarded as entirely within its constitutional powers. And I think we might reasonably hope that such arbitrators, if carefully selected and if entitled to the confidence of the parties to be affected, would be voluntarily called to the settlement of controversies of less extent and not necessarily within the domain of Federal regulation. I am of the opinion that this suggestion is worthy the attention of the Congress. But after all has been done by the passage of laws, either Federal or State, to relieve a situation full of solicitude, much more remains to be accomplished by the reinstatement and cultivation of a true American sentiment which recognizes the equality of American citizenship. This, in the light of our traditions and in loyalty to the spirit of our institutions, would teach that a hearty cooperation on the part of all interests is the surest path to national greatness and the happiness of all our people; that capital should, in recognition of the brotherhood of our citizenship and in a spirit of American fairness, generously accord to labor its just compensation and consideration, and that contented labor is capital's best protection and faithful ally. It would teach, too, that the diverse situations of our people are inseparable from our civilization; that every citizen should in his sphere be a contributor to the general good; that capital does not necessarily tend to the oppression of labor, and that violent disturbances and disorders alienate from their promoters true American sympathy and kindly feeling. The Department of Agriculture, representing the oldest and largest of our national industries, is subserving well the purposes of its organization. By the introduction of new subjects of farming enterprise and by opening new sources of agricultural wealth and the dissemination of early information concerning production and prices it has contributed largely to the country's prosperity. Through this agency advanced thought and investigation touching the subjects it has in charge should, among other things, be practically applied to the home production at a low cost of articles of food which are now imported from abroad. Such an innovation will necessarily, of course, in the beginning be within the domain of intelligent experiment, and the subject in every stage should receive all possible encouragement from the Government. The interests of millions of our citizens engaged in agriculture are involved in an enlargement and improvement of the results of their labor, and a zealous regard for their welfare should be a willing tribute to those whose productive returns are a main source of our progress and power. The existence of pleuro-pneumonia among the cattle of various States has led to burdensome and in some cases disastrous restrictions in an important branch of our commerce, threatening to affect the quantity and quality of our food supply. This is a matter of such importance and of such far-reaching consequences that I hope it will engage the serious attention of the Congress, to the end that such a remedy may be applied as the limits of a constitutional delegation of power to the General Government will permit. I commend to the consideration of the Congress the report of the Commissioner and his suggestions concerning the interest intrusted to his care. The continued operation of the law relating to our civil service has added the most convincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness. It is a fact worthy of note that every public officer who has a just idea of his duty to the people testifies to the value of this reform. Its staunchest, friends are found among those who understand it best, and its warmest supporters are those who are restrained and protected by its requirements. The meaning of such restraint and protection is not appreciated by those who want places under the Government regardless of merit and efficiency, nor by those who insist that the selection of such places should rest upon a proper credential showing active partisan work. They mean to public officers, if not their lives, the only opportunity afforded them to attend to public business, and they mean to the good people of the country the better performance of the work of their Government. It is exceedingly strange that the scope and nature of this reform are so little understood and that so many things not included within its plan are called by its name. When cavil yields more fully to examination, the system will have large additions to the number of its friends. Our civil-service reform may be imperfect in some of its details; it may be misunderstood and opposed; it may not always be faithfully applied; its designs may sometimes miscarry through mistake or willful intent; it may sometimes tremble under the assaults of its enemies or languish under the misguided zeal of impracticable friends; but if the people of this country ever submit to the banishment of its underlying principle from the operation of their Government they will abandon the surest guaranty of the safety and success of American institutions. I invoke for this reform the cheerful and ungrudging support of the Congress. I renew my recommendation made last year that the salaries of the Commissioners be made equal to other officers of the Government having like duties and responsibilities, and I hope that such reasonable appropriations may be made as will enable them to increase the usefulness of the cause they have in charge. I desire to call the attention of the Congress to a plain duty which the Government owes to the depositors in the Freedman's Savings and Trust Company. This company was chartered by the Congress for the benefit of the most illiterate and humble of our people, and with the intention of encouraging in them industry and thrift. Most of its branches were presided over by officers holding the commissions and clothed in the uniform of the United States. These and other circumstances reasonably, I think, led these simple people to suppose that the invitation to deposit their hard-earned savings in this institution implied an undertaking on the part of their Government that their money should be safely kept for them. When this company failed, it was liable in the sum of $2,939,925.22 to 61,131 depositors. Dividends amounting in the aggregate to 62 per cent have been declared, and the sum called for and paid of such dividends seems to be $1,648,181.72. This sum deducted from the entire amount of deposits leaves $1,291,744.50 still unpaid. Past experience has shown that quite a large part of this sum will not be called for. There are assets still on hand amounting to the estimated sum of $16,000.I think the remaining 38 per cent of such of these deposits as have claimants should be paid by the Government, upon principles of equity and fairness. The report of the commissioner, soon to be laid before Congress, will give more satisfactory details on this subject. The control of the affairs of the District of Columbia having been placed in the hands of purely executive officers, while the Congress still retains all legislative authority relating to its government, it becomes my duty to make known the most pressing needs of the District and recommend their consideration. The laws of the District appear to be in an uncertain and unsatisfactory condition, and their codification or revision is much needed. During the past year one of the bridges leading from the District to the State of Virginia became unfit for use, and travel upon it was forbidden. This leads me to suggest that the improvement of all the bridges crossing the Potomac and its branches from the city of Washington is worthy the attention of Congress. The Commissioners of the District represent that the laws regulating the sale of liquor and granting licenses therefor should be at once amended, and that legislation is needed to consolidate, define, and enlarge the scope and powers of charitable and penal institutions within the District. I suggest that the Commissioners be clothed with the power to make, within fixed limitations, police regulations. I believe this power granted and carefully guarded would tend to subserve the good order of the municipality. It seems that trouble still exists growing out of the occupation of the streets and avenues by certain railroads having their termini in the city. It is very important that such laws should be enacted upon this subject as will secure to the railroads all the facilities they require for the transaction of their business and at the same time protect citizens from injury to their persons or property. The Commissioners again complain that the accommodations afforded them for the necessary offices for District business and for the safe-keeping of valuable books and papers are entirely insufficient. I recommend that this condition of affairs be remedied by the Congress, and that suitable quarters be furnished for the needs of the District government. In conclusion I earnestly invoke such wise action on the part of the people's legislators as will subserve the public good and demonstrate during the remaining days of the Congress as at present organized its ability and inclination to so meet the people's needs that it shall be gratefully remembered by an expectant constituency.

Andrew Cuomo,United States of America,2020-03-16,"… with a different set of rules, and Rensselaer with another set of rules, people would be confused, and again, if you don’t like the rule, you get in your car, you drive 15 minutes, you’re in a different jurisdiction subject to a different set of rules. So in New York, you cannot shop New York City versus Westchester versus Nassau versus Albany versus Schenectady. It’s one set of rules for the entire state, and it should be one set of rules for the entire nation, and that is the role of the federal government and national leadership, and it is lacking. The federal government should put one position in place and coordinate it with the states. If the federal government isn’t going to do what it should do, then the states have to try their best, right? And the best way is for me not only to have a uniform policy within the state of New York, but to the extent you can, cooperate with surrounding states so you all have a common set of practices, right? I don’t want to close down bars in New York, but Connecticut leaves the bars open. Why? Because then many people will get in their car and they’ll drive to Connecticut to go to a bar, which is the last thing we want. Now we have people who are drinking and driving. It makes no sense. I don’t want to have one set of rules here and a different set of rules in New Jersey, because then I close down the bars, you’ll get in the car, you’ll drive through New Jersey. It makes no sense.
“Well, then get the states to coordinate themselves.” Yes, very hard to do. Luckily we have set a template where our regional states work together. Many of you came to our regional meeting on marijuana laws, and I have a good relationship that I’ve developed with the surrounding governors, so we have actually deployed that here, and I just did a call with Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey and Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut, and we are adopting the same policies, so there is no benefit to try to shop New York versus Connecticut versus New Jersey.
There will be no more gatherings of 50 plus people, so if you were hoping to plan a graduation party, you can’t do it in the state of New York. You can’t go do it in the state of New Jersey, and you can’t do it in the state of Connecticut. Casinos. We all have casinos. If I close my casinos but New Jersey keeps their casinos open, you’re going to have the same problem. All casinos will be closed effective 8:00 PM tonight, and they will stay closed until further notice. On all these closings, they are all until further notice, and hopefully I can coordinate with the other governors so we can have this same opening period just the way we had the same closing period. Gyms are closed, effective 8:00 PM tonight. I know that’s a specific hardship for the people in this room, because I can all see your masterful shape, buff even. There are other ways to exercise. Theaters closing at 8:00 tonight until further notice.
Any bar or restaurant closes at 8:00 tonight. However, there is a silver lining for these establishments, because we’re also very aware of the economic consequences for these establishments. So the state liquor authority is going to change its rules. They’ll have guidance up by 5:00 PM this evening that will allow bars, restaurants, distilleries to sell their products off premises. So whatever you could get, whatever you could order in the bar or restaurant or distillery or winery, you can purchase through takeout, and we hope that goes a long way towards alleviating any economic hardship. Stay home and order from your favorite restaurant, order from your favorite bar, order from your favorite winery, order from whatever establishment that you were thinking of patronizing. Just order it and stay at home. And again, the state liquor authority will change their rules to allow that. It’s not currently allowed. We will only allow it during this period of closure, but I think it will help those businesses. As you know, we’ve done a lot of work with the wineries and distilleries to grow that industry in New York, and I want to make sure we protect them.
Now everybody is at home, and they’re at home with their kids. My kids are a little older, but I remember the old days. When you’re in the house with a number of young kids, the house can get very small very quickly. The kids can get very rambunctious very quickly. We’re going to waive all park fees in all state parks, local parks, county parks. So you want to get out of the house, great, go to the park, the weather’s changing. Take a walk, enjoy. Enjoy your family, and do it in an environment that is not a dense environment, which is exactly what the parks provide.
Other actions, all local governments must reduce their workforce by 50% minimum. I’m directing all local governments to allow their non-essential personnel to stay home, work from home, with a 50% minimum. Local government can go higher than 50%, but it must be a 50% minimum work from home, which is the same thing I’m asking private businesses. If we can ask private businesses to do that, the government I think leads by example. So not just for New York State government, which will do this also, all local governments, non-essential people work from home, and a minimum of 50% of the workforce must stay at home.
Second, I’m directing local governments to make sure that all their local police departments and emergency management services are supplied with masks, surgical masks. You have police officers who are encountering people in all different circumstances, EMS workers who traditionally wear masks, police officers who traditionally do not, but I was at the New Rochelle drive through testing center the other day, and if you’re a police officer, you’re walking up to a car, you’re stopping a driver, they roll down the window, by definition you’re within more than six feet. You don’t know who you’re talking to. People who are positive who don’t even know that they’re positive. I want all the police officers who are showing … All first responders are showing great courage, getting up and going out and doing their job every day. I want them to know that we understand the situation they’re putting themselves in and we’re providing the necessary precautions.
So every local government must provide the local police department, EMS workers with masks. New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland must have childcare, educational services and meal programs in place by midnight. We said that those schools will be closing, but we need to take care of the negative, the downside of closing the school. This is not an easy decision. There are negatives when you close a school. Most notably, you don’t have childcare for central personnel. You don’t have childcare for healthcare workers. Remember, remember, please, the greatest challenge and the greatest damage is going to be done by an overwhelmed healthcare system. Nurses, healthcare workers, 1199 members don’t have alternatives to childcare.
Public education is also this state’s childcare system. It’s this nation’s childcare system, and it’s not that easy to say, “Well, let them get a babysitter.” They can’t afford it, it’s hard to find, and we would have created a true negative situation if we lost healthcare workers or first responders because we closed schools and they had to stay home with their children. This is solved easily enough. You’re closing schools, don’t close all the schools. Leave a couple of schools open or parts of schools open to provide childcare for the essential personnel. We also have to have meal programs and meal services in place and educational services in place. On that condition, I ordered the schools closed, but it’s on that condition, and I want those plans and I want them in place by midnight, and they have to be approved.
We strongly advise that only services and businesses that are essential stay open after 8:00 PM. Grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies, medical facilities. We want people home. We want less density. We strongly advise this. This is not mandatory, but it is strongly advised. And it’s not mandatory at this time, and it may be in the future, but it is strongly advised at this time.
Testing. We have had a phenomenal increase in testing. We’ve been able to use our laboratories. Our emergency management team has done a very good job of reaching out to our state labs, getting them on track, getting them coordinated. Our testing numbers are way up, as you’ll see. By the end of this week, we think we’re going to be up to about 7,000 tests per day, which is an exponential increase of what we have done. I made this suggestion to the Vice President. I made it to the President. I often tell you when I am unhappy with the federal response to this state. The fairness dictates that kudos where kudos are due, and here the Vice President and the President responded very quickly, so I want to thank them for that.
We started at a drive through testing facility in New Rochelle, Westchester, where we have one of the highest clusters. It’s one of the first in the United States, I believe actually the first on the eastern seaboard. It has worked very well. It’s safe for everyone. You drive up in your car. You never get out of your car. You’re tested in your vehicle. They take the test kits back. The time that it takes to take the test is actually faster than we thought. Doesn’t normally happen in government. We allotted 15 minutes per car. It’s actually running ahead of that schedule. We want to replicate that, because it’s just smart.
The worst thing is a person walking into an emergency room. If you are positive, you infect other people. If you’re negative, you may get infected by walking into the emergency room. So this is the best way to test someone. We said we were going to open one on Long Island after the positive New Rochelle experience. We’re also going to open one on Staten Island. Staten Island does not have an abundance of hospitals. Staten Island is a community where people drive, and Staten Island I believe is an appropriate location for this. I also think that Staten Island feels that they have not gotten the level of attention of health services that they need, and I’ve spoken to Max Rose, I spoke to Senator Andrew Lanza, and I believe this is going to make a difference. We’re also open one in Rockland County on the same theory.
We’re going to a new phase in this entire process. We talked about early detection, and we’ve talked about testing. We talked about containment. You see those numbers are going up, that means you’re moving towards a mitigation phase and you’re moving to a phase where you must expect a significant inflow into the hospital healthcare system. Now again, this is the great curve they talk about, plus or minus. “Flatten the curve, flatten the curve, flatten the curve.” That’s what all you hear. That’s what you hear every day on TV. You see this curve. “We must flatten the curve.” The concept is right. Flatten the curve, slow the spread so the healthcare system can handle it. When they say this, I don’t think of a curve. I think of a wave, and the wave is going to break, and the wave is going to break on the hospital system.
We’re doing everything we can to flatten the curve. I believe we’ve taken more dramatic actions than any state in the United States. I believe we’ve had the most effective response of any state in the United States. I don’t believe we’re going to be able to flatten the curve enough to meet the capacity of the health care system. So in this business, plan ahead, plan forward, anticipate what’s coming down the road and get ready for it. Expanding the capacity of the health care system for a state is virtually impossible. Building a hospital is a very elaborate, extensive, expensive undertaking.
Again, we need the federal government to play its role. The federal government has tremendous capacity. I was in the federal government. I was a cabinet secretary. I worked with the military. I worked with the Army Corps of Engineers. They have tremendous capacity. This is what they do. This is what they do. They build airports. They build the bridges. They build hospitals. This is exactly what they do. Deploy the Army Corps of Engineers to come work with states to build temporary medical facilities. Get us backup beds, so when the hospital is overwhelmed, we can have some of the people who are in the hospital beds go to a backup medical facility. It makes all the sense in the world, and if you don’t do it, you know what is going to happen. You’re going to overwhelm the hospitals. You only have 53,000 hospital beds. You only have 3,000 ICU beds. Why? Because our health system is basically a private system. They don’t build capacity that they don’t need. They don’t build extra ICU beds just in case. An intensive care bed is very expensive. They don’t build a wing of ICU beds that sit vacant for 10 years on the off chance that there’s going to be a public health emergency and you will need the beds. They don’t. It’s not economic. It’s not their business model, so we don’t have them. We have the capacity that people use day in and day out, and that’s not just New York. That’s every state in the United States. You now have this influx. You can’t handle it. You overwhelm the hospitals. You have people on gurneys in hallways. That is what is going to happen now if we do nothing. That is what is going to happen now if we do nothing, and that, my friends, will be a tragedy. We know what lies ahead. Look at the numbers from China, South Korea and Italy. You don’t have to guess. You just have to project. The numbers are on a chart. Our numbers are on a chart.
The numbers are on a chart. Our numbers are on a chart. Just extend the current trajectory. Just go dot, dot, dot, dot, and you’ll see the numbers rise. And you compare those numbers to our hospital capacity and it’s still math at the end of the day, and it doesn’t work. The federal government must do this. Assume the federal government doesn’t do what the federal government is supposed to do, which would not be a wild assumption as it hasn’t happened today. Well then as a fallback, the states have to do whatever they have to do and the state has to mobilize to create backup medical facilities and that is what we are going to do. We’re going to organize the National Guard, we work with the building unions, and work with private developers to find existing facilities that could most easily be adapted to medical facilities. Meaning what? Meaning dormitories, meaning former nursing homes, facilities that have that basic configuration that could be retrofit.
Even that is not easy because you have the construction element and you also have the equipment element. It is very, very hard to get medical equipment now because everybody on the globe is trying to buy the same medical equipment. Everybody wants to buy a ventilator, everybody wants to buy oxygen. Everybody is trying to buy the same equipment and it’s terribly scarce. That’s why you go back again to the capacity of the federal government, which operates and maintains a medical emergency stock where they have stocked medical equipment for domestic issues or for wartime, right? When you go to war and they set up a wartime hospital, they have equipment, they have it stockpiled. That’s why they are uniquely suited to do this,.but in any event, we’re going to do the best we can.
I need first and foremost to find available facilities that can be converted. And I’m asking local governments, especially in the most dense area, to immediately identify a number of beds in facilities that are available. Frankly, I hope they’re surplus because we don’t have… This is very expensive and I don’t want to pay money for acquisition of property and real estate, but we need the communities that are most effected to begin finding available beds. New York City, we estimate conservatively, at this point should identify 5000 additional beds. Nassau, 1000 additional beds. Suffolk, 1000 additional beds. Westchester, 2000 additional beds. Why more for Westchester? Westchester has the New Rochelle cluster, which as you know has a significant number of people who tested positive. We will do everything we can, but we need federal assets and we need federal assistance. I am very proud of this state government and what it can do. And we have done things that no state government has done before. We build the bridges. We build the airports. We’ve responded to emergencies, but know what you can’t do. We don’t have the billions of dollars that you would need to implement an immediate emergency hospital construction program. This state can’t do it. No state can do it.
To increase hospital capacity of the existing hospitals. In the meantime, DOH is going to be suspending its regulations to allow existing hospitals to increase their space and capacity. DOH has regulations about how many beds per room, how much space between beds, etc. How wide the hallway has to be. Those are going to be suspended so hospitals can actually use their physical space with more efficiency. We’re leaving it up to the hospitals for their discretion and prudence in making these decisions, but we do have to get very aggressive about them better using their existing space.
I want the private hospitals to be on notice that we may soon be canceling elective surgery. We are not doing it now. Elective surgery is between 25% and 35% of the beds. Some of the elective surgery is critical, some is not critical. The noncritical elective surgery may be canceled on a mandatory basis. I’m asking them now as a precaution to start to plan to cancel elective surgery that is not necessary. We will need that capacity in the hospitals when those numbers peak.
Michael Dowling, who was the former health commissioner for the state of New York, phenomenal fellow. He worked with my father and was in my father’s administration. He was health commissioner. He was deputy secretary. He’s just a jewel of a human being, and he’s one of the best healthcare professionals in the United States of America. He runs Northwell now, which is a magnificent organization. But Michael and Ken Raske… Ken Raske runs Greater New York Hospital Association. They coordinate all the hospitals. I ask them to convene all the hospitals and now start developing the maximum surge capacity. So if a hospital’s capacity is 500, what if we bring in more beds? How many more beds can you hold? What if we brought in more staff, et cetera. We also have a number of efforts going on on finding more staff, more doctors, et cetera, not just for the surge capacity, but also for the additional facilities we may open.
These are the new number of tests. We’re up to 7,000 tests, so it’s a dramatic increase. 1600 new tests. What happens when the testing capacity increases? The number of positives increase by definition. So the number of new cases has gone up 221 to 950 cases. And you can see New York City is increasing. Westchester is still disproportionate to the population of Westchester. That still represents the New Rochelle cluster. Nassau, 109; Suffolk, 63; Rockland, 16; Albany, 12; Orange at 11; Dutches 10; Monroe, nine; Ulster, seven. Number of new cases, New York City and Westchester. Some in Nassau, some in Suffolk, but you’ll see the cases rise in the most dense areas because that’s where people are transferring the virus among themselves.
Counties with new cases today, Allegheny, Onondaga, Ontario, and Wyoming. So you see the spread continues.
Most impacted States in the United States. We are now 950 number one in the country. 676 for Washington state. Again, these cases are more an example of how many tests you are doing and who you’re testing rather than a raw number of cases in that area. Our deaths have increased to seven. Washington is the next hightest at 42. Total deaths in United States 67.
Hospitalizations 158 out of 950. That’s 17% of the cases. When we talk about hospital capacity, just take that 17% and it’s always, if you notice, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%. run that 17% against whatever you think the total infected population will be and then compare that to our hospital capacity and that will keep you up at night. Hence the situation that Dr. Zucker and myself and my colleagues are in.
Again, perspective, perspective, perspective. I went through the numbers in Italy. I went through the numbers in South Korea and China last night. You look at all these numbers, they’re the same story. You look at the deaths in New York, it’s the same story. People who had underlying illnesses, if they got the flu in a normal season, they would be in grave trouble. Instead, they got the coronavirus and they had existing illnesses and they passed away. Remember before any of this, somebody would pass away in a hospital, an older person and you would say, “How did they die?” And they would say, “Pneumonia.” You’d say, ” Pneumonia. Well, how’d they catch pneumonia?” Well, it wasn’t really pneumonia. It was they had heart disease. They had emphysema. They was struggling with cancer and then the pneumonia becomes the accelerant to a bad situation and that’s what’s happening here.
Any of my colleagues, additional points. Why don’t you make them? Melissa?
Robert? Questions.
He can be in the gym this morning, and you can be in the gym this afternoon. You can be in the gym this evening. You just can’t be in the gym after eight o’clock.
Yeah, you can use the gym.
Are you asking me if I go to a public gym?
No, I have my own workout routine that I have developed over a number of years that I do alone. So I don’t do it in the gymnasium.
Go ahead.
We’re having ongoing conversations and none have been conclusive.
It’s an unfair question for Commissioner Zucker because it’s anyone’s guests. But I recommend this to you, Google that question, and you will get a range from 40% to 80% of the population. Merkel said, what? 70%?
60% of her population. 40% to 60%. So take 40% or 60% of 18 million, take a hospitalization rate of our sample of about 17% and then compare that to 50,000 hospital beds. You will then break out in a sweat, maybe hives. You will feel great anxiety, panic attack. And you’ll be right.
Yeah, that was yesterday’s policy. Today’s policy is non-essential workers, a minimum of 50% of the workforce for our state government and every local government in the state.
I want federal guidance, Jesse. You can’t have one state taking actions that are different than other States. There are ways to do it. You could say if your state has a density index of over X; if you have more than this many cases, then this. But when you leave it… This is like the reverse federalism. This is a national pandemic and there are no national rules. So literally the national news broadcast today would cause somebody to panic. Everybody on their own with all these hodgepodge. Just say, you don’t even have to make it mandatory. Just let the federal government say, “Here’s what we think you should do.” So I know what Connecticut is going to do and Massachusetts is going to do and Pennsylvania is going to do or they’re likely to do. So I do the same thing. Look how much damage you can do. I close down my bars. Jersey doesn’t close down their bars. Everybody drives to Jersey to drink. Everybody drives home. It makes no sense.
I did not get there here. We are the tristate area. We have the most interaction. Obviously part of New York or Butts, Massachusetts and Allan share tacos back and forth. Part of it goes, we have contiguous with the Pennsylvania also. We did convene them for the marijuana regional discussion. We started here. We will be expanding, but this was quite an elaborate undertaking because you had to align three states’ policies. So this is not just consultative. We actually all adopted the same policies, Jesse. I don’t ever remember this happening, period.
This preempts what any mayor anywhere or county executive anywhere in the state set. The same point I make about the national government is even more true on the state level. You can’t close bars in Manhattan but leave them open in Nassau because now everybody drives to Nassau for the bar. You have to have one set of rules that are uniform and that’s why in an emergency situation, there’s actually a protocol that makes sense. Local governments can set rules, the state can override those rules, and the federal government can override state rules because it’s not a situation where you can allow all these disparate policies. They are actually counter not only to common sense, but they’re counter to public safety and they’re counter to public health.
We will.
We will.
Well, yeah. And we’ll have an announcement this afternoon on the specifics of that because people want to know exactly how and when and what hour, et cetera.
Reevaluate. That’s all it is. Even two weeks, miraculously, everything is fine, I’ll reopen every school in New York in two weeks. So-
Yeah. I haven’t communicated with SED yet, Jesse. So that’s what we’re planning. We will have specific guidelines that we announced this afternoon.
Sure.
Excuse me. Just look at these numbers please. Where are they for you? Since it started, 169,000 cases. 77,000 recovered on the 169, since it started. 85,000 are pending, which means there’s still ill. 6,000 passed away. I’m sorry.
Just to go back to Jesse for a second. Jesse, I want a uniform policy on the schools also because you have two parent families who have children in schools, businesses that are operating, that have employees with in children in different school districts. So we want to get a uniform school closing policy also. And that’s what we’re working with SED about. So hold on the details of the school closing policy, but we will be closing all schools. That is true. And I then want to have a uniform policy so we have a semblance of a normalcy.
Yes sir.
Yes sir. And I want to make sure every school district is in a position to do that and they know it’s coming and they’re preparing for it.
Did gyms?
But I don’t know what the other gyms’ policy is going to be.
There should be a rainy day fund set aside. There should be a snowstorm fund set aside. There should be a fog fund set aside. All those set aside should be done. Obviously, I’m kidding. The budget I asked the controller to give me his re-estimate of the revenues. Let’s just take a second on this because it’s important that you understand. The essential element in the budget is the projection of revenues and that’s why there’s always a disagreement on the revenue projection and we have this whole elaborate process to come up with a consensus revenue forecast. We did a revenue forecast. Since we did a revenue forecast, the world has changed 180 degrees three times. I asked the controller for a revenue forecast. He’s doing it.
You turn on the television, you look at the stock market. You tell me what the revenue forecast is. My best guess is our revenue forecast was outrageously high compared to what is going on. How high, who knows? Rob Mojica, who can be an optimist for very brief intervals of time, says that there’s a theory that the market is a V it dropped quickly and it’s going to come up quickly. That’s the theory. What is the effect of these businesses that are closing down? How much revenue did they lose and how much less tax revenue will we get? How many people will be laid off and not earning income, and how much tax revenue will we lose? There is no doubt that the revenues are going to be way down. So, rainy day fund, that was my attempt at humor, have a rainy day fund, a number of reserve funds.
That is very true. On top of that, you have the Medicaid redesign team coming back, which is trying to close what was already a $2.5 billion hole. We now have a new complication that could only happen in a world of total chaos. The federal government is, passed the first coronavirus bill, which I have lamented. $8 billion, New York state only gets $35 million. They’re now passing a new Coronavirus bill. In that Coronavirus bill, New York state gets the lowest level of reimbursement. They do it based off the Medicaid funds. New York State gets 50% of their Medicaid funds reimbursed. Some states get 75%. No state gets less than 50% in raw dollars. We do very well, but that’s only because we spend more than anybody else.
But in that bill, they tucked in a provision that said you can make no changes whatsoever to your Medicaid program. Which means if you want to take the literal approach, the MRT, which is recommending changes in the Medicaid program cannot be accepted because of that federal bill. Why the federal government would have passed the written-in language that says you can’t make any changes to your Medicaid program. Why our New York delegation allowed it when they knew in January we had an MRT, Mike Dowling, Dennis Rivera, were heading it, the second time we did it to find improvements. I have no idea.
I understand your position. Would you like to make a wager my friend, that you’re incorrect?
Okay, I know. And we went through this. Okay, so you want to make a wager that you are wrong casinos.
I will wager you that you are wrong, that you misread the bill, that the bill says you can’t make any changes to the Medicaid program, which would preempt the MRT changes. I have no doubt that they did it as political protection. You’re half right. They did it for political protection so the counties wouldn’t have to pay anything more, which is ironic by the way, since we voluntarily now pay all the excess from the counties, which we did on our own. The federal government never said, “You should pay all the increased costs,” but they not want to tell us you can’t raise it. It also said, do you have the language here?
Wait, don’t read it yet. How much are we wagering I?
Okay. Read the language.
I’ll take the beer right now as a matter of fact, because you’re not going to be able to give it to me after eight o’clock.
Without the MRT, you can’t balance the budget. So I spoke to Senator Schumer. They tried to say, “Oh no, all we did was protect the local governments and New York City.” This provision says, goes well beyond that says, “No, MRT.” You can’t do a budget without the MRT. Now we can’t do a budget until they fix that. Anyway, I spoke to Senator Schumer, I spoke to Congresswoman Lowey, calling Congresswoman, Speaker Pelosi. But it was a terrible blunder by the federal government and it makes it impossible to do the budget. And they have to fix it and they have to change it.
No, Wednesday’s fine. April 1 is the budget.
No, I did the petition by executive order.
Well, what they don’t pass is the paid sick leave, which also gave people pay for their quarantine period. So I’m sure the people who are in quarantine and wanted to get paid wish that they voted for the bill so they could get paid.
On what, I’m sorry?
Yes sir.
I have not heard that obviously, but I will check forthwith. Shouldn’t be, shouldn’t be.
Oh no, you lost the beer. Let’s be-
Okay. You want to go double or nothing on that question?
On what theory could you apply for a waiver for law that is not changed and be granted the waiver in time to do a budget for April 1.
I do a budget contingent on a waiver?
$2.5 billion, maybe we’ll get it, maybe we won’t.
Never.
I never had a $2.5 billion contingency. You couldn’t get it rated.
Who knows that?
Rob?
Yes.
Two beers, Jimmy. Two beers.
But Jesse, if you take your story in that, not that you didn’t write it. Your Times story on projections, it answers that question. See, the range is so broad. If you go from 40% of the population to 70% of the population, it is so broad and the hospitalization rates tend to be somewhat predictable. China will tell you their hospitalization rates. South Korea will tell you, Italy will tell you. I mean there’s like hundreds of thousands.
Seven.
So you cannot ask three questions about bar and restaurant closures.
I’m just saying it’s, go ahead.
You said it.
This is a statewide executive order. Different governments may have different executive orders. This one overrides all executive orders.
I’m going to take you to my gym one day.
I’m sorry?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. We’re here, we’re doing our job like everybody else, especially like government employees. Like the police are out doing their job and the correction officers are doing their job and the nurses are doing their job and the transit worker unions are doing their job. Public service, we’re here in public service and that’s what we’re doing at a time when you desperately need public service. You join the military, you know when they need you? When there’s a war, that’s when they need you.
And this is a war against coronavirus. So we’re here, we’re working.
Yes. I want to see as much as we can get done. Only caveat, I want to do things right. I know the legislature, sometimes they’re overly anxious to pass a bill and then you pass a bill and then it turns out it was a mistake and then you have to come back and fix it. I want to do as much as we can do. Only caveat if it has not been thought through, that’s a different story. I want to do what we can do as long as we can do it right. Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-09-26,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I stand before you today to fulfill one of my highest and most important duties under the United States constitution. The nomination of a Supreme court justice. This is my third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. And it is a very proud moment indeed. Over the past week, our nation has mourned the loss of a true American legend. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a legal giant, and a pioneer for women, her extraordinary life and legacy will inspire Americans for generations to come. Now, we gather in the Rose garden to continue our never ending task of ensuring equal justice and preserving the impartial rule of law. Today, it is my honor to nominate one of our nation’s most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme court. She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the constitution, Judge Amy Coney Barrett.
We’re also joined by Amy’s husband, Jesse. Thank you Jesse very much and their seven beautiful children. Congratulations to you all, very special day. With us as well our, the first lady, thank you first lady. Along with vice president Mike Pence and his amazing wife Karen. Thank you very much Mike. Judge Barrett is a graduate of Rhodes college and the University of Notre Dame law school. At Notre Dame, she earned a full academic scholarship, served as the executive editor of the law review. Graduated first in her class and received the law school’s award for the best record of scholarship and achievement. Upon graduation, she became a clerk for judge Lawrence Silberman on the U.S Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia. Amy then received one of the highest honors. A young lawyer could have serving as a clerk on the Supreme court for Justice Antonin Scalia. A very highly respected law professor at Notre Dame wrote to Justice Scalia with a one sentence recommendation.
Amy Coney is the best student I ever had, that’s pretty good. Justice Scalia hired her shortly thereafter and we are honored to have his wonderful wife, Maureen, where is Maureen? Maureen Scalia with us today. Thank you. And our great secretary of labor. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Very good genes in that family I will say, very good genes. Before joining the bench, Judge Barrett spent 15 years as a professor at the university of Notre Dame law school. She was renowned for her scholarship, celebrated by colleagues and beloved by her students. Three times, she was selected at Notre Dame, distinguished professor of the year. When I nominated judge Barrett to serve on the U.S court of appeals for the seventh circuit in 2017, every law clerk from her time at the supreme court, endorsed her and endorsed her nomination.
Writing quote, “We are Democrats, Republicans and Independents, yet we write to support the nomination of professor Barrett to be a circuit judge. Professor Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character. She is eminently qualified for the job.” And I can tell you, I did that too. I looked and I studied and you are very eminently qualified for this job. You are going to be fantastic, thank you, really fantastic. The entire Notre Dame law facility and faculty, everybody at that school also. We got so many letters, also wrote letters of support of Amy’s nomination to the seventh circuit they wrote in effect, “Despite our differences, we unanimously agree that our constitutional system depends upon an independent judiciary staffed by talented people, devoted to the fair and impartial administration of the rule of law. And we unanimously agree that Amy is such a person.” For the last three years, Judge Barrett has served with immense distinction on the federal bench. Amy is more than a stellar scholar and judge she’s also a profoundly devoted mother.
Her family is a core part of who Amy is. She opened her home and her heart and adopted two beautiful children from Haiti. Her incredible bond with her youngest child, a son with down syndrome is a true inspiration. If confirmed Justice Barrett will make history as the first mother of school-aged children ever to serve on the U.S supreme court. That’s good. To her children, Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet and Benjamin. Thank you for sharing your incredible mom with our country. Thank you very much. Amy Coney Barrett will decide cases based on the text of the constitution as written. As Amy has said, “Being a judge takes courage. You are not there to decide cases as you may prefer. You are there to do your duty and to follow the law wherever it may take you.” That is exactly what Judge Barrett will do on the U.S Supreme court. I want to thank the members of the Senate. We have so many of them here today, thank you very much. I see you in the audience and you’re so proud.
But I want to thank you for your commitment and to providing a fair and timely hearing, I know it will be that. Judge Barrett was confirmed to the circuit court three years ago by a bipartisan vote. Her qualifications are unsurpassed, unsurpassed, and her record is beyond reproach. This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation, should be very easy. Good luck, it’s going to be very quick. I’m sure it’ll be extremely noncontroversial. We said that the last time, didn’t we? Well, thank you all very much and thank you for being here. That’s really great. Thank you. Thank you. I further urge all members of the other side of the aisle to provide Judge Barrett with a respectful and dignified hearing that she deserves and frankly, that our country deserves. I urge lawmakers and members of the media to refrain from personal or partisan attacks. And the stakes for our country are incredibly high.
Rulings that the supreme court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our second amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety, and so much more. To maintain security, liberty and prosperity, we must preserve our priceless heritage of a nation of laws and there is no one better to do that than Amy Coney Barrett. Law and order is the foundation of the American system of justice. No matter the issue, no matter the case before her, I am supremely confident that Judge Barrett will issue rulings based solely upon a fair reading of the law. She will defend the sacred principle of equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Congratulations again, to Judge Barrett, I know that you will make our country very, very proud. Please, amy, say a few words. Thank you very much, congratulations, congratulations.
Come on up family. Come on up family. I want to acknowledge and Attorney General Bill Barr, Bill thank you very much for being here. Chief of staff, thank you very much chief, doing a great job and all of the senators, please. We really appreciate it and I know you’re going to have a busy couple of weeks, but I think it’s going to be easier than you might think. So thank you very much for being here. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Congratulations Amy.
",Donald Trump SCOTUS Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett Transcript,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-scotus-nomination-of-amy-coney-barrett-transcript
Andrew Cuomo,United States of America,2020-05-29,"Thank you, again. Thank you to Iona College President Carey for having us here today. I know it’s a busy day and a distressful day on many levels, but let’s proceed. Today is day 90 of the corona pandemic crisis. “Follow the facts. They will show you the way.” -A.J. Parkinson. That’s what we’ve been doing in New York, following the facts. The facts today in terms of the coronavirus are good. Number of hospitalizations are down. Net change in total hospitalizations is down, intubations are down, and the new cases are down to 152, which is a dramatic, dramatic drop for us. At one point… we’ll never get to zero. What is the bottom of the curve? I don’t know, but we’re close. And the number of deaths, thank the good Lord, continues to decline. It’s at its lowest level ever of 67 deaths. And we hope and we pray that that continues to be the case.
The question is on reopening and as everyone knows, we’ve been looking at the numbers, looking at the metrics in terms of different regions across the state. The overall state was hit the hardest by this virus. And we’re coming back as the smartest. We were forced to learn more and learn faster and respond quicker because we were hit by the invisible enemy, the European virus, the virus from Europe, when everyone said watch China. Well, they were wrong. The virus came to New York from Europe. We have metrics that are posted. We want all the people to know exactly what we’re doing because they are the ones who decide what happens. So communicating this information has been key from day one. We have now done even more testing. We test more than any state in the United States per capita. We test more than any country on the globe per capita. And that is helpful in a number of ways. It also gives us more and more information to make decisions. So we can now look at the number of tests we’re doing by a specific area in the state and see on a day-to-day basis, what is happening with the spread of the virus by the number of tests in that area. And you can actually see a trendline from day to day, right? This is all about opening smart, which means what? Which means you are tracking the virus. And we can now track it on a day-to-day basis to help us inform us about our decisions and how we should react.
And we have a new dashboard that actually tracks that information. And you can see remarkably clearly what is happening in terms of the spread of the virus, the severity of the new infections, new infections in the region. So everyone will know exactly what’s happening and why we’re doing it and what we’re planning to do. The reason we are so rigorous about this is because many states and countries have reopened and they made mistakes. Yes, everybody wants to open tomorrow. I wanted to open before we ever closed, but you have to be smart. And we’ve seen what has happened painfully when cities and states and countries reopened too quickly, they had to, they wound up closing again, which is the worst situation.
So be smart. We have the data, we have more data than almost any other place on the globe because of our testing. And we have had it reviewed at every level. All the local officials sign off, the regional official sign off, the best state experts. And then we go to global experts who have done this in countries around the world who frankly have more experience than we do because they’ve been through this, the crisis and the closing and the opening and the closing again. And we review all the data with them. And I want to thank them all very much for taking the time to go through the data. But these are literally the best minds that you can find on the globe and when it comes to this and they have gone through all the data.
So I feel confident that where we can rely on this data and the five regions that have been in phase one can now move to phase two because their data has been reviewed. And the experts say to us it’s safe to move forward because people have been smart and you haven’t seen the spike. So they go to phase two. Phase two is all office-based jobs, real estate services, retail reopening, barbershops, hair salons reopening, that’s all part of phase two. There’s specific guidance on how to reopen in phase two. It’s not just open the doors and everybody has a party. It’s 50% occupancy in office buildings, signage on markers, et cetera, no meetings without social distancing. Don’t share food or beverages. I mean, I see people all the time sharing food and beverages. You really don’t want to do that now.
But again, there’s specific guidance for every area. Retail stores, 50% occupancy, wear the face covering. A store owner can tell you they don’t want you to come in if you’re not wearing a face covering. Why? Because you don’t have the right to infect the store owner, you don’t have the right to infect other customers in the store and you don’t have the right to walk into a store and all the other customers run out because you don’t have a face mask. Malls are closed except stores that open to external entrances curbside. But again, very detailed guidelines.
Barbershops, hair salons are open by appointment only. The professionals in those operations have to get a test every two weeks. We recommend that the professionals get a test before they reopen. That’s not a mandate. That’s a recommendation. And we recommend to customers to ask the barber or professional in the hair salon if they had a test before you use their services. That’s a recommendation. But they have to get a test every two weeks. And if I were walking into a barbershop, I would say, I would ask the barber, “Did you get a test before you reopened? When was the last time you got a test?” And if they got a test, they’ll have a certification. They’ll have an evidence of that test. And people will wear face coverings.
But the basic rule is still it’s all about how we act. It comes down to that. How the employer acts, how the store owner acts, how the employee acts, how the individual acts, how the local government acts. Reopening in New York City is more complicated as we know. But we are on track to meet all the metrics, hospital capacity of 70%. We want 30% hospital capacity. So God forbid something goes wrong, we have the hospital beds. We want to make sure we have the stockpile of PPE. We’re not going through what we went through last time, searching the globe for ventilators and masks and gowns. I mean, we learned that lesson the hard way, this entire country did, but it’d be madness to go through that again.
We have to have the testing in place, which we do. The contact tracing is being brought up to speed. We believe all of these things can be done next week. The MTA preparations for reopening, but we think all of this can be done by next week. And we would be on track to open the week afterwards. One of the things we want to do and we have been doing is I want to focus on the hotspots. Again, follow the facts. We have the data. We can tell you by zip code where the new cases are coming from. They are in New York City, they’re outer borough, they’re more Brooklyn, they’re more the Bronx. They are lower income areas. They’re more minority areas. And we know where they are by zip code. Some of these zip codes, you have double the infection rate in those zip codes that you have citywide.
Citywide, the infection rate is about 19%, 20%. In some zip codes, it’s over 40%, the infection rate. We know where these zip codes are. Next week, let’s do a full court press on these zip codes. And we’ve been talking to our colleagues in the city, speaking to the mayor about this. Next week, hospitals, PPE, get that contact tracing up. MTA will finish their final preparations, but then hotspots, hotspots, hotspots. We’re in New Rochelle today where we had the first hotspot in the nation.
There was no such thing as a hotspot before New Rochelle had a hotspot. Congratulations, New Rochelle, created a new term now used by every American, hotspot, in this regard. But we know where the hotspots are in the city. We want to focus on them next week, be ready to open. We are on track to open on June 8th, which is one week from Monday and next week, as I mentioned, we’ll be following up on these issues. Phase one should bring about 400,000 employees back to work in New York City. Remember that reopening does not mean we’re going back to the way things were. Life is not about going back. Nobody goes back. We go forward.
Life is not about going back. Nobody goes back. We go forward. It’s going to be different. It is reopening to a new normal. It’s a safer normal. People will be wearing masks. People will be socially distanced. It doesn’t mean they don’t like you. It’s not a personal reflection. It’s just a new way of interacting, which is what we have to do. Wear a mask, get tested and socially distance. It is that simple, but that hard. It is that simple, but that hard. Those simple devices, wearing a mask, hand sanitizer, they make all the difference. They make all the difference. You talk to all the experts, “What advice? What should we do?” Wear a mask. “How can it be that simple?” Because, sometimes it’s that simple. The doing is what’s hard, not the advice. Getting 19 million people to do it, that’s what’s hard.
What happens is up to us, up to us. People say, “Governor, tell me what’s going to happen next week, the week after.” I can’t tell you. Only you know. It’s the person in the mirror. You tell me how the people of New York City respond, I’ll tell you what happens in New York City. You tell me how the people in Westchester respond, I’ll tell you what happens in Westchester. The New Rochelle hotspot, that was all done by New Rochelle. It was no act of God. It was no external force. It happened because of what people in New Rochelle did.
We know how we got here. We know how we can get from here. If we act smart, these stores open and they’re smart, the customers are smart, people are smart, people on public transit are smart, then we won’t see those numbers go up, as we haven’t in the upstate regions that have reopened and Long Island that has reopened. The numbers have not gone up. Why? Because people have been smart. We have to continue to be smart. We’re going to be doing this in New York City with our partners. I want to thank the Mayor very much and his team very much.
Everybody in government has been working overtime. None of us have been here before, but we are figuring it out. I’m proud of the way New York is figuring it out. We wish we were never here, but once we were here, we have made the best of it. We should be proud. The Mayor is looking fit and healthy and rested. I don’t know why, but he’s looking extraordinarily good. It’s good to be with him in this new way of everyone is virtual, everyone is Zoom. But it’s not the virtual Mayor, it is the real mayor of the city of New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Good to be with you mayor.
There are about 100 hospitals in New York City, 11 are the hospitals the Mayor was referring to, the New York City hospitals. But then there were about 90 other hospitals, they have to have the beds available. They have to have PPE available. We’ll be working with them, but we’ll get there for June 8th. June 8th, we have to be smart. Again, this is not a happy days are here again, it’s over. We have to be smart. We’re going to remind New Yorkers of that.
I want to make one point about the larger context of what’s going on in Minneapolis today, which I’m sure is very distressing to all of us. I want to begin by offering our personal thoughts and prayers to the family of George Floyd. On behalf of all New Yorkers who have seen that incredible video, we can imagine your pain. You are in our thoughts and prayers.
I would also suggest that when we think about this situation and we start to analyze this situation and the reaction, let’s not make the same mistake that we continually make, which is we tend to see incidents. This is an incident, an isolated incident and people focus on an isolated incident. It’s not an isolated incident. It is a continuum of cases and situations that have been going on for decades and decades and decades. These are just chapters in a book. The title of the book is continuing injustice and inequality in America. These are just chapters.
The chapters started modern day, Rodney King in Los Angeles, 1991. Abner Louima in New York, 1997, Amadou Diallo in New York, 1999, Sean Bell in New York, 2006, Oscar Grant, Oakland, California, 2009, Eric Garner, New York City, 2014, Michael Brown, Missouri, 2014, Laquan McDonald, Chicago, 2014, Freddie Gray, Baltimore, 2015, Antwan Rose, Pittsburgh, 2018, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia …
… Pittsburgh, 2018; Ahmad Arbery in Georgia, 2020; Brianna Taylor in Kentucky, 2020; George Floyd in Minneapolis, 2020.
That’s why the outrage. That’s why the frustration and the anger. It is not about one situation. It’s about the same situation happening again and again and again and again, and seeing the same thing and not learning the lesson. Then it’s that happening in a broader context and a broader circumstances, which is what’s going on with the coronavirus, which affects and kills more minorities than anyone else. You look around this country and you look at the people who are dying of the coronavirus, it is this proportionate African-American people. It’s just a continuing injustice. That’s the frustration and that’s the protests. Nobody is sanctioning the arson and the thuggery and the burglaries, but the protestors and the anger and the fear and the frustration? Yes, yes. The demand is for justice. When the prosecutor came out and said, “Well, there’s other evidence, but I can’t tell you anything more than that,” That’s only incited the frustration. Injustice in the justice system, how repugnant to the concept of America, and over and over and over again.
I stand figuratively with the protestors. I stand against the arson and the burglary and the criminality. I stand with the protestors. I think all well-meaning Americans stand with the protestors. Enough is enough. How many times do you have to see the same lesson replayed before you do something? This country is better than this. It has been better than this, and it shouldn’t take this long to end the basic discrimination and basic injustice.
Any questions?
Well, improvise. I think the mayor’s point was it’s up to you. You want to go into New York City, you go into New York City the way you want to go into New York City. If you want to drive, you can drive. You want to pay that parking, you want to deal with that traffic, that’s that’s your business. If you want to take public transit, you take public transit.
I understand why people would be anxious about public transit. That’s why the MTA is doing extraordinary work. They really are. I mean, people used to complain about how the MTA cleaned trains and buses, right? They didn’t clean the trains and buses well enough. Well, they’re now disinfecting them. I mean, that’s standard. It was just unimaginable, right? You can disinfect a train? They’re doing it. Closing the subways at night helped, but they’re disinfecting trains. The trains are disinfected. They’re using UV lights. They’re using all sorts of chemicals. They’re experimenting with films that you can spray on that kill a virus for 30 days that are a leading technology. The public transit system will be operational, is operational, and we wouldn’t operate it unless it’s safe. People have to wear masks, but the public transit system will be safe and individuals will make their own choice as they always do. Right?
I’m a Queens boy. I always had the choice: Take the train or take the car. But as I said, taking the car has obvious environmental issues and is incredibly expensive.
Yeah, that’s a good question, Dave. Look, this has always been about finding this new normal and everyone doing their part on an individual level and employers, private companies doing their part. I’ve been, frankly, amazed, pleasantly, at how creative and how thoughtful the employers have been in staggering, their workplace, staggering hours, staggering days. The employers have been responsive. Also, the employees won’t come back otherwise. The market works here. People want to work, people need jobs, but they’re not putting their health at risk. I think the employees are demanding response from employers, but I think employers have been very creative, and that will continue.
You have to see if that is an issue. Social distancing, as we maintain it in other circumstances, I don’t know that you’ll be able to maintain strict social distancing on a bus or a train. I don’t think that’s reality. I’ll ask Rob Mujica to comment because he’s also an MTA board member, not just the budget director. When a train is late, I blame Rob also. They can’t do strict social distancing, but they can do the cleaning protocol, the disinfecting protocol. You have to wear a mask. You have to wear a mask, and that’s going to be part of the protocol. They’re going to be doing the best they can to stagger volume on trains, et cetera. They’re going to have personnel who are working to limit how many people get onto a train and do the staging.
Rob, you want to mention anything else on that?
Yeah. Excuse me one second, and then I’ll get right to you.
The individual responsibility also pertains to riding the public transit system. Yes, we will need a cooperative public where if you’re on a subway platform and you see the subway car is crowded, okay, wait for the next one. If you see the bus come and the bus is overcrowded, okay, be responsible. Wait for the next one. People will be part of that also.
Also, remember this, this is only Phase One. Part of the intelligence of the system is you don’t go from zero to 60 miles an hour. You go from zero to 20 miles an hour. This brings 400,000 people, Phase One, into the system. 400,000 is not a significant number in New York City, right? In a normal operating environment. You start to open gradually. I used to talk about turn the valve. Just turn the valve a little bit and watch how the system operates and see how it works. Then if you have to adjust, adjust. Nobody’s been here before. I’ve never said I know how this is going to work. We know the answers. Nobody can give you the answers. They don’t even know the questions. Nobody re-opened New York City. In history, nobody reopened in New York City. Nobody closed down New York City in history. That’ll be my claim to fame. First governor to close down New York City. Reopening, Phase One, that’s all.
Now, Phase One has worked very well in the other regions. Starting slowly has worked very well because you see little adjustments that you have to make, frankly. Little things you wouldn’t have thought of when you start to open stores, you start to open attractions. This is only 400-
… open attractions. It’s only 400,000 people, and we’ll learn, and we’ll adjust.
My prioritization for next week are the hotspots. The zip codes with twice the infection rate… They’re driving the new cases, so they’re a health care issue. And it’s the largest area of deaths. When it’s the area of hospitalizations is the area of deaths. And look, I understand the economic consequences. This state will have an historic economic problem from this situation. And I get that painfully, but for me, from day one, it’s been about the number of deaths. This has been about that for me from day one. Any of those numbers, I know we can deal with. We can fix deficits, we can fix shortfalls, we can fight with Washington for funding. The one number that we can’t fix is the number of deaths. That’s the only number that keeps me up at night, and the hotspots’ higher infection rate, higher hospitalization rate, higher death rate. So that’s first.
They thought it was earlier today than 1:00?
Today is today, and yeah, they wanted it this morning instead of one o’clock? Yeah. Well, I can understand that, but we want to make sure that the data was reviewed by all the experts. A county executive may be very good at what they do, but they’re not an expert in viral transmission in a global pandemic. I may be competent as a governor, but I am not expert in global transmissions of a viral pandemic, so I wanted to make sure we had the best minds look at all data before we stepped forward. It’s stone to stone across the morass. If you take a step and you’re not on a stone, but you step on a lily pad going across the morass, you will sink, and that’s bad. So I wanted to have the best minds review all the data to give us their opinion. They’ve signed off on it. And the difference between this morning and 1:00… I never talked to anyone about timing, morning or 1:00.
It’s a good question. Have we looked at that?
Yeah. Talk about never having done this before. So you’re right. It is restaurants, and now a new category, outdoor dining. Is that the same as a restaurant? And then what they’ll say back in the office is, well, outdoor dining on 2nd Avenue in Manhattan or in Albany? What is the size of the sidewalk? What is the volume on the sidewalk? Are they socially distancing from the table on the sidewalk? But we have to look at it. Okay. One more.
I’m not commenting on the safety or behavior of any particular protest. You had a lot of violence on some of these protests
Yeah. But on any particular protest, obviously, obey the law. I’m against any of the criminality that has gone on. Arson, thuggery, et cetera. But Martin Luther King, the right to speak up, the protest, the frustration. I stand with that because I get it. I get it. Look, for my lifetime, basically as an adult, I’ve lived this, seeing this from Rodney King forward. I mean, I was there for Amadou Diallo, I there for Abner Louima. And then you have Eric Garner, and then you have George Floyd. It’s the same case. Just change a couple of facts. It’s the same exact situation. And when does it change? It’s not like a situation that you can’t understand. Here’s a minority, here’s an African American here. Here they are being abused. And it’s the same situation. It’s been 30 years since Rodney King. Amadou Diallo in New York, the reporter won a Pulitzer prize for the reporting. Wow. Great job by journalists. Great job showing the injustice. And what happened? What was the resolution? Where was the progress? Eric Garner? No, I’m with the protesters. Thank you very much.
It’s not up to you when you open. You have to follow the law, or you will be closed. Thank you.
",NY Governor Andrew Cuomo May 29 Press Conference Transcript,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/ny-governor-andrew-cuomo-may-29-press-conference-transcript
Ed Miliband,United Kingdom,2020-07-07,"We have consistently called for a recovery which has energy efficiency at its heart, and will welcome any measures which achieve that.
However, this is not a comprehensive plan. It appears there is almost nothing for the people who rent the 8.5 million homes in the social rented sector and private rented sector, which has the worst energy efficiency standards. That means one third of people are left out.
It also needs to be part of a much broader and bigger scale strategy for getting back on track for net zero which includes a zero carbon army of young people getting back to work, investment in nature conservation, driving forward renewable energy, helping our manufacturers be part of the green transition and a plan for our transport network.
The French government has promised 15 billion euros for a green recovery, the German government 40 billion euros. The UK government £3 billion so far. When the moment demands the Government creates the most ambitious green recovery possible, the Government has not so far risen to the challenge.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-11-03,"Well, thank you very much. And hello, Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi. The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country. Right?
Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before. We’re now an economic powerhouse. We’ve never been in a position like it. We’ve rebuilt our military and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high.
Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded. That’s not bad. That’s not bad when you’re on the debate stage and you say, “We have the best economy we’ve ever had. We have the best military we’ve ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we’ve ever had.”
Said, “Got the best president we’ve ever had.” Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. And very importantly, we’ve confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. In a very short while, we’ll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that? You’re supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn’t work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the world’s number one terrorist leader to justice.
We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain’t depleted anymore. Yep. al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader… Look, you’ve heard about it for a long time. I kept saying, “Where is al-Baghdadi? That’s the one I want. Where is he?” And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two. I don’t know if you read about that. But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he’s dead. And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you. And our military loves Mississippi.
America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again. It’s about time. But while we’re creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane.
The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize. We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there… Look at all of them, oh. It’s too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn’t, they wouldn’t be here. Look at how many. It’s like the Academy Awards before it failed. Right? And you know why it failed? Because they disrespected us.
But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see what’s going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax. That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, let’s go get him. That didn’t work out too well, did it? That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way.
And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi-
… and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty. And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt. This is one I never thought I’d be involved in. The word impeachment… To me, it’s a dirty word, not a good word. Totally phony deal. They know it. Everybody knows it, and that’s why we’ve never had greater support than we have right now. It’s true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside. You’ll see a lot more people trying to get in. So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out. Anybody want to leave?
Because there really is. There’s no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi. We could have done this one on Monday night. I said, “Let’s do Friday.” Right? Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives.
They’ve been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won. But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, “The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun.” At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterday’s vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself. But I’ll tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest I’ve ever seen them, the most unified I’ve ever seen them. Right? The most unified I’ve ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats’ outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020.
Make no mistake. They are coming after the Republican party and me because I’m fighting for you. They don’t like it. This is different. They’ve never had anything like this. Well, they’ve never had an election like 2016 either, have they? They never have. They’ve never quite figured it out.
And they know they can’t win, so let’s try and impeach him. How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right? “You know, we got to impeach him because we can’t beat him.” I don’t think so. Right? I don’t think so. Al Green, he’s another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it’s not me, it’s us. It’s all of us. It’s 63 million, but it’s much more than 63 million. Much more. And right now, our numbers are higher than they’ve ever been before. They’ve never been this high. But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and that’s what we’re doing, and that’s what’s taking up so much time. We’re draining the swamp in Washington.
Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… Spying. They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, they try and say, “Well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, that’s wonderful.”
The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess they knew we were going to win, right? But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, that truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary’s shocking and very many misdeeds.
33,000 emails. 33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter’s wedding. 33.
She’s a beauty. How about last week? Did you hear? I don’t know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing. She’s not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, she’s a greenie. That’s fine. We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we’ve ever had, and yet we’re number one in the world in energy, by far. We took over.
But I don’t know Jill Stein. She ran last time. I don’t know, but I know she’s not an agent of Russia. And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, “They work for Russia, they’re agents of…” I said, “You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement.” She made it about them. Everybody laughed because of what we proved. But I’ll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them.
But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. I’ve just beaten, with no… Look, look, we didn’t have too much political experience. I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business. Just did one show. It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success. 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didn’t do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him, I said, “Oh, it’s terrible. What have they done to this beautiful show?” Arnold?
But think of it. I’ve just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty.
And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right? He was all over the place. It’s the only time I’ve actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump. True. True. Remember he said… Remember he said, “He will not be president”? Well, that didn’t work out so well. And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking. And we are kicking their ass. I’ll tell you.
In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I’m now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries. Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president. But we’ve now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe. Very slow. He’s gotten slower and slower. I’m afraid if he gets a nomination, he’ll be so slow we’ll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary. In fact, I don’t even think that Sleepy Joe will get it. But many people are running. So, you know, it’s so early. I don’t want to talk about their campaign.
Oh, did you hear Beto? Beto? Did you hear Beto? Beto. Oh, that poor bastard. Well, poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms a-flailing? Remember that? You know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz… And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good. But I used to watch him. Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables. He was standing on countertops. I said, “Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?” But he’s waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, “What the hell is he doing? What is he on?” And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this? Anybody that says he was born for this, they’re in trouble.
I used to have guys come into my office, “Sir, I’m the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell…” You know, the truth is anybody that says they’re a great salesman, usually they’re not a very good salesman. It’s true. It’s those sneaky ones in the back that don’t talk, that you don’t know about. They’re the ones. But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven. He came down. And if that’s the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself.
And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be. So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that don’t work well in the state of Texas. Right? He was against religion. He was against you having a gun.
And he was against oil. So you come from Texas, you don’t like religion, you don’t like oil, and you don’t have guns. I don’t know. That’s not a good combination in the state of Texas. That’s not good in Mississippi, either. I don’t know it’s that good anywhere. Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we won’t be hearing about him for a long time. It’s amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twist…
Oh, Alabama. Love Alabama. I love Alabama. I love Alabama. It’s a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, “Well, let’s see. I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him? How do I beat him? How do I beat this guy? He’s such a great.” Clinton, she was easy. Right? Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was. But sleepy Joe, I’m worried about, right?
So then I said to myself, “Gee, I guess there’s only one way. Let’s call up Ukraine for help.
These people are sick. These people are sick. Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they’ll put it, because they’re so damn dishonest, and they’ll just say-
… “Let’s use Ukraine for help.” That’s what they’re going to say. And they won’t show the laughter, and they won’t show the sarcasm, and they won’t show the fun because they’re the most dishonorable people almost on earth. It’s a disgrace. But we say it anyway. And here’s the good news. The people get it.
So they have a brand new president in Ukraine. Good guy, by the way. And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and I’m on a phone, right? And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen. And I’m on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, “Please, could you help me please?” I don’t know who he is. I didn’t know his name until I looked down the card, I see. And he’s a nice guy, and hopefully he’s going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems. And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason… Why isn’t Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren’t they doing things that they’re supposed to do? Why is it always the United States?
So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect. It was perfect. It wasn’t like almost… It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, “Could you call and say hello?” Now I’m an honest person, anyway. But do you think, when I’m making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line? Many people.
… people listening on the line. I’ve many people, all of these people. You had the Secretary of State Pompeo, great guy. He’s listening. You had transcribers, fortunately. Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people. And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president. I guarantee he’s got a lot of people listening, too. These people are sick.
So corrupt politician, Shifty Adam Schiff, actually stood before Congress and stood before the American people and made up a conversation that he said I had with the Ukrainian president. Unfortunately … No, think of it. And many people saw that, and it was a terrible … He said terrible things. The president of Ukraine said it was a very good conversation, there was no pressure. His foreign minister said the same thing: no pressure. They must think we’re nuts, to be honest. It’s all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let’s give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we’ve ever had.
So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don’t quit. But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe. So I quote, “I said” … Let me act like him. I’ve got to speak really slow though, and … “I said, ‘You’re not getting a billion.’ I looked at them and I said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn’t fired, you’re not getting the money. You understand? You’re not getting the money.'” Then he goes, at the end … I didn’t know he had this kind of energy. He goes, “Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.”
You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn’t think he had the energy, the brain power. It’s turned out he doesn’t. By the way, he’s dropping like a rock. When you’re at 1%, there’s always a reason. He should be there fairly soon. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was $1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son’s company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young … How old are you?
Six. This young, beautiful person in front of me.
Six. And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think I’d basically go with her. So what is it all about? It’s called a payoff, but you know what? The fake news, they apologize. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper. Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo. You’ve got Fredo and … That’s Cuomo, Fredo. I call him Fredo, like from the movie.
Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn’t know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said, “I don’t know these people. I don’t know them. I don’t know them.”
He never spoke to his son about getting millions of dollars. No, he never spoke to him. Didn’t happen to speak to him. Think of this: we’re dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That’s why I like Beto, he wasn’t smart, couldn’t handle it. I told my wife, I said, “See, it’s not so easy.”
I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love. They love her. When Beto quit, he quit like a dog. When he quit I said, “See, people think this is easy. This isn’t easy,” but it just worked out that way.
But Biden said, “I never met the people, never met the gentlemen.” Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they’re playing golf together, but he never met him. So now you’ll ask him, he’ll say, “No, we played around a golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that they’re paying my son millions.” Oh, no, no, no.
But the press protection: watch this crazy Anderson Cooper. Third-rate. Lousy ratings. Third-rate person. But listen, CNN, the worst. I mean, the worst. The worst. Oh, the light just went off, see? Look. The light was on, they just turned. They don’t like it. It’s tough. You’re fake, CNN. No, it’s tough. I tried not to do that because I see their light on. When their light goes on, that means you’re live. No, that means you’re live. And every time, it’s tough. Look, in all fairness, they’re putting it on. It’s a broadcast. I guess they do watch us.
But here’s the thing. And then you have the guy up there saying that they’re fake, that they’re no good, that they’re liars and cheaters, that they’re phoneys. It’s hard to be broadcasting that when you’re talking about the network that has you on, right? So, we understand. Their light’s off. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don’t want anything to do with him. They were love fests. What a thought. He’s weak. He’s a weak person, but they’re all weak. But let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media.
We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don’t know, you probably read it. We threw them out at the White House. We don’t show them anymore. If somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out. And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? We had a tee shirt made, “Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter?”
Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the Morning Show. That was the last we’ve seen of Hunter. That wasn’t good. The morning of his father’s very bad debate, but it’s, where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don’t have them in the White House. I said, “No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don’t” …
We used to have them stacked up, and I’d go in and I’d see a meeting with my people and they’re dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody. And I’d go into these offices; I’d see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. I keep trying to figure out who’s worse. And one day it’s the Times, one day it’s the Post. It’s like top each other, they’re so bad. It’s so phony. In my opinion, it’s virtually corrupt. I’ve never seen it. You never have a good story. I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from?
The other thing, if Obama would have done it … because, look. This guy built ISIS. The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. That’s a big, lot of land. 7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were … How can you be happy? But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled. But you know what? And you know what? We don’t do it for … We do it because it’s right.
That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever. Bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast. Done. And that’s okay. I didn’t do it for the story. I did it because it’s the right thing to do. But if I were a Democrat, they’d be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don’t even want to … They actually played it down. And actually, and I’m happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me. And I’m very happy with that. I’m very … Conan is incredible. And Conan’s coming to the White House in a few weeks.
But it is true. Did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They’d be talking about his bravery. Oh, so bravery. But again, 142 judges he gave us. Remember that. How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts. Great ones. Great judge. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever? Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with?
Anyway, just to finish. So Hunter then goes to China. Now I’m dealing with China right now. They don’t like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else … And would they like to have … How about this? You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can’t get it. He walks out with $1.5 billion. And then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, it’s disgraceful that the press doesn’t cover it for what it is. It’s a payoff. It’s a payoff.
And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal? They are not liking me. They had the worst year that they’ve had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars. We’re taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we’re doing with some of it? Just a small portion, but 100%, they’re taking care of … Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. So they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing. And they thought our farmers would say, “Oh, we don’t like Trump.” They did just the opposite. They said, “We know he’s doing the right thing because we’ve been ripped off for so many years.”
But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy; I said, “Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product?”
He said, “Sir, $16 billion.”
I said, “Good, I’ll make it up.”
And we’re going to have a lot leftover. So we will have, pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents. They only took. They only took. So when I said to the farmers, “We’re going to send you $16 billion, and it’s already been sent. And it’s been split into $12 billion the year before.” I mean, think of that, $28 billion. I said, “Compliments of China.”
And we had a lot left over. Not bad, right? Not bad. You think Obama would do that? I don’t think so. You think Hillary would do that? I don’t think so. You think Sleepy Joe would do that? I don’t think so. He wouldn’t know what you’re talking about.
On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. It’s very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. They’re corrupt. Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician. You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, “Oh, I’m going to sue him.”
They said, “Sir, I’m sorry. You can’t.”
He’s got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this? But here’s the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what’s going on. A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican … Right? Republican governor, right?
Hey, he’s a great guy, too. And all I know is he’s loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work. Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something. I’ve tried to get him, but some guys are confident. Phil said, “No sir, I’ve been doing this all my life. I love the people.” He built the most beautiful African-American museum. Phil, he’s the greatest, but he built the most beautiful … But he’s got confidence. And he said, “No sir, I’d been doing it. I don’t really want to do that.” In other words, he said, “That’s enough.”
Most people are so insecure, they keep going and going and going. It’s not good. I like Phil’s attitude better. But Phil is great, but I’m going to introduce Phil in a second. But Tate Reeves, who Phil endorses and views as a champion for your state and, really, a champion for Mississippi values. And Tate helped cut your taxes over 50 times, including the largest tax cut in Mississippi history. Tate is pro-worker, he’s pro-jobs, he’s pro-family, he’s pro-life. Tate is a true leader in the fight to protect the unborn. The other side is not. I love our police. We love our police.
He’ll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible. They’re terrible. And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment. So Tate’s running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood. Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama. Isn’t that nice? He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win. And that’s not the kind of guy we need here. Not in Mississippi. He’s supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with … Oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey. They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won. We won, fairly easily.
But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this? I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education. They want to give them this. They want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally-
… more advantages than our own citizens have, more advantages than our own military has. Jim Hood wants to raise your taxes. He supports taxpayer funding for abortion providers.
And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you don’t want a far left Democrat running Mississippi … Wait a minute. How’s this guy? I can’t believe this is a competitive race. It’s embarrassing. I’m talking to Mississippi. I’m talking to Mississippi. I can’t believe it. I don’t think that he’s going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. He’s going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great governor. Tate, come on up. Tate.
Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. He’ll never let you down. And don’t kid yourself. Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him. It’s under attack. So we’re also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and I’ve sort of said it a lot, but he’s been a great governor and he loves your state. He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant. Where’s Phil? Come up, Phil. Come up.
Oh, he’s central casting. Look at him. Come here, Phil.
Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job. What a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So another man who’s a warrior is a friend of mine. Whenever there’s a problem, he’s there. He’s always there. He’ll be right at the front. He is tough. He is smart. He’s brilliant, actually. And he loves this state and he loves you people. Senator Roger Wicker. Roger.
Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody, I’ll call her up because, believe it or not, she’s running with me. She just ran. I said, “Cindy, you just ran. You just won.”
She said, “No, I have to do it again.”
She’s running in 2020. I thought she’d have six years. I said, “Cindy, it’s only like a year.” Cindy Hyde-Smith. She’s incredible. She’s tough and smart and strong, and she’s with us all the way. Cindy Hyde-Smith.
Great job. Fantastic woman. So also with us, two terrific friends of mine that, like Roger and like Cindy Hyde-Smith, and like all of them … And Tate, he’s going to be right there. He’ll be right up there with us, all fighting together. Two incredible people: Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann. Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasure, David McRae. State Auditor, Shad White. Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson. Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney. And former governor, a man that nobody’s ever heard of in this room, I’m sure, but the truth is he’s a legend in politics and a great guy. He’s a great guy, Haley Barbour.
Thank you, Haley. Great guy. So with the help of everyone here, we’re the hottest economy in the world, we’ve created over 6.7 million new jobs since the election. If I would have said during the campaign that I would create 6.7 million new jobs since the election, these people would have gone crazy. They would have said horrible things. They would have said it’s impossible. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years, soon to be historic. African-American unemployment just dropped to the lowest rate ever recorded; historic. Really unimportant to me, the African-American youth unemployment rate is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country. We lifted 55,000 Mississippi residents out of poverty, 55,000.
Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, we’ve already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average $2,000 to $2,500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What’s happening? You couldn’t get the money. The big companies, they couldn’t get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us. All put to work.
We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world.
For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two of the worst deals ever made by our country. 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and that’s awful, and a big price to pay for Washington’s disloyalty to the American worker. That’s what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am.
I’m a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity. We’re stopping China from ripping us off. We’re stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That’s not happening anymore. It’s reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it.
We’re replacing NAFTA … and that was a disaster, NAFTA … with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesn’t want to give the people of our country a victory. She’s very busy doing other things. Having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi’s farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else. It’s a great agreement. About time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now.
The last administration’s horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity. Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … Blue Springs. Blue Springs.
Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world. We take care of other people. We take care of other countries, but we don’t take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, “King, we’re going to help you, but you’ve got to pay.”
And he was great. No, he was great. He was great. He said, “But nobody has ever asked before.” I said, “But I’m asking.” And billions of dollars will come in, and we’re protecting a great ally. We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things. But we said, “You’re very wealthy. You have to pay,” and they’re going to pay. And that’s true with many countries by the way. That’s true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country … I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan. I said to Prime Minister, I said, “How did you get away with this for so long?” And he looked at me and he couldn’t really answer it because how the hell did this happen? We’re protecting 94 countries. Ask China, “How many countries are you protecting President Xi?” And they look at me like, “What a stupid question. We protect one. China.” You ask President Putin, “How many countries are you protecting President Putin?” And he looks and he goes, “Russia.” You ask other countries … we’re protecting at least 94. In fact, so many they can’t even tell me. I’ve been trying to get an answer for four months. So many they can’t even tell. It’s crazy, but it’s all beautiful the way it’s happening. A lot of good things are happening.
But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I don’t like that. I don’t like that. The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a day.
After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests.
It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood. Not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest. One soldier stepped on a nail. That’s true. I said, “Don’t tell the press that because they’ll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail.” I said, “How bad was it?” “It’s okay.” I said, “Don’t mention it please.” They always like to mention exactly what happened. You can take it a little bit low key. Stepped on a nail.
Not a drop of blood. And we don’t have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. They’ve been fighting for 1000 years. But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you don’t mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And we’ll distribute that oil, we’ll help out the Kurds, and we’ll help out other people. We’ll also help out ourselves if that’s okay.
Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones. Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We don’t want to do that.
To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures. Toughest ever that we’ve ever had. No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders, which mean crime. They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels. Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall.
We’re building it.
We’re building it. And you think that was easy? The Democrats, they didn’t want that wall. I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents. Not 25 cents. But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there. Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases. We’re winning cases now. Winning a lot of cases.
But the wall is going up rapidly. It’s going up rapidly. And this is a very serious wall. This is the exact everything they wanted. I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE. Incredible people, tough people. They love our country. And I said, “Give me the specifications for the wall.” They said, “Well sir, we’d like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar.” I said, “Well, what do you want? Which one?” So I did all three because it’s a different form of cutting. You can cut through steel, but you can’t through the concrete and then you can’t through the hardened rebar. We got it all. “And we also need see-through, sir. Got to see who’s on the other side.” That makes sense, right? Not just concrete. It’s more expensive what we’re doing, but we’re giving and we’re building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It’s going up fast.
In all the right areas. In all the right areas. That was a tough one. And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. They’re great. Great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border. And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it’s never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders. 27,000. You know what that is? And they are keeping people out. And I want to thank the President of Mexico. He’s an excellent person, great man. And we appreciate it.
And the reason is that our Democrats won’t even approve things called loopholes. They’re loopholes. That’s a horrible name, right? That means it’s a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things. Catch and release. You catch them. Then you’ve got to release them. By law you’ve got to release them or they’ll arrest the border patrol agent if they don’t release. It’s crazy. But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they don’t want to do it. They don’t want to do it. They’re obstructionists. They’re colluders. And we can’t let it happen. That’s why you have to go with Tate Reeves. Tate’s going to send a big signal, by the way. It’s a big signal. It’s great for you. He’s going to be a great governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats. It’s very important that Tate wins. Very important.
We’re also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, “We’re not going to have them,” and Roger Wicker said, “We’re not going to have them. And Cindy said, “We’re not going to have them.” Democrats’ sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE … and they are heroes, I wouldn’t want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging. You never saw anything like it. I’ll say, “You know what? Better you than me.” Let’s see who would do good. He’d do good. That guy. That guy would do good. Most of you wouldn’t do too good. No. I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it? They’re moving thousands of people from MS-13.
These gangs are the worst people. These people, these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, “How dare you say they’re not human?” You ever see these people? And they slice people up with a knife because it’s more painful than using a gun. And then I have to defend myself when I say they’re animals. But you know what? I never changed. I didn’t say, “Oh, I’d like to apologize. I’d like to apologize. Crazy Nancy.”
And you got to look at her district in San Francisco. She’s spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff. Take a look at what’s happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. It’s thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy. Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district.
If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves. Tuesday. Got to get out. You got to get out. Got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too.
The Democrat party has never been more extreme, you know that, than it is today. The Democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. We’ll always take care of them.
Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb right up until the moment of birth. Well, the governor of Virginia executed a baby. Remember that whole thing. After birth, after birth. Some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African American community than the Republican party. And we’re also the party of Abraham Lincoln. We can’t forget that. People forget. Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe.
To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunities zones. So incredible. So successful. Including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix. And Tim Scott, I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina.
We pass VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. People said it couldn’t be done. VA Choice. Our veterans were waiting on line for days and weeks sometimes. They can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don’t have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks. We had people waiting in line. They weren’t very sick. By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans.
The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville. And Roger has been fantastic. And Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
To protect America’s security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It’s not the same country anymore. Nothing’s easy, but it’s not the same. And I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state. With your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history.
And you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high, it’s … I will tell you something … if we didn’t win this election, that stock market would be in one-half. It was heading in the wrong direction. It was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen, that stock market will crash like you’ve never seen a crash before. And you will not be happy with your 401ks like you’re happy right now because they don’t know what they’re doing. They don’t know what they’re doing.
And I’d like to speak well, but the leadership, they have no clue. They’re just very vicious people. Actually, they’re sort of mentally violent people, but we’ve got it under control. It always helps when you didn’t do anything wrong. I always say, “How do you impeach a President who didn’t do anything wrong?” So we’re going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, you’re going to get out and you’re going to vote, and you’re going to give up whatever you have to give up. You’re going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late. Tell your boss I said it was okay. I will give you a pardon if I have to. I’ll give you a one-hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. And you have great congressmen here and I’ll tell you, I want to appreciate it, fellas. Warriors, you’re warriors. You are warriors. What was it? 196 for and nothing against, right? That doesn’t happen with Republicans. It doesn’t happen. I always complain. I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies. Open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing. They stick together and they’re vicious. The Republicans have great policy. In many ways they’re better politicians, but they’re not as vicious.
Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. They’re not as vicious, but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats don’t seem to have any Mitt Romneys. We do. We do. I don’t know. Maybe he’ll get better. Maybe he’ll get better. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens. Maybe he’ll get better. Just let it be fair, but they don’t have that.
We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, ‘Made in the USA.’ Made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that? Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that, I said, “That’s incredible.” We’re going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. It’s funded. Nobody would have thought we could do that, but we’re doing it. We’ll have it ended in America in 10 years. The AIDS epidemic. Who would’ve thought?
We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.
We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will. You’ll never see it disappear. In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And today it’s greater than ever before.
Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. That’s what we’re doing. That’s what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We’ll get so tired of winning. I don’t know, Mississippi. You’re winning. You had the best year you’ve ever had. You have the best, Mississippi, the best year you’ve ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi. Your statistic. Mississippi, aren’t you getting tired of winning?
I guess not. So Phil doesn’t come to me and say, “Sir, please, we’re willing too much. The people of Mississippi can’t take it anymore.” I don’t think you’ll ever have to make that trip. I don’t think he’s ever going to have to, and I don’t think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.
Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you.
","Donald Trump Mississippi Rally Speech Transcript: 2019 Rally in Tupelo, Mississippi",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mississippi-rally-speech-transcript-2019-rally-in-tupelo-mississippi
Gavin Newsom,United States of America,2020-04-28,"… a deep dive on one particular indicator around testing and tracing, tracking, issues of isolation and quarantine. Today I want to update you on another indicator, and that’s specific to businesses, schools and childcare facilities. But first I want to remind all of you what those six indicators are. I mentioned testing as one of the principal indicators. We’ve made real progress in that space. Not nearly where we want to go and need to be, but real progress we are now seeing in this space. Some 578,000 tests have been conducted in the State of California. We are averaging over 20,000 tests a day, and we are well on our way to meeting our 25,000 testing goal and getting to 60 to 80,000 very shortly thereafter.
I mentioned just yesterday OptumServe that was doing these end-to-end tests have been deployed at 80 additional locations, primarily focused on rural California. I can announce today that we are putting those tests, end-to-end tests, in Sutter County and Shasta County as specific proof points of the movement in that space. All of those testing sites will be up and operational by Monday. Verily also focusing on expanding their testing with a socioeconomic lens to diverse communities, not just in rural California but inner city California. So real progress in that place.
Yesterday, we updated you as well on some of our efforts to train the workforce starting phase one, 10,000 tracers throughout the State of California, partnerships that we’re forming in that space, and capacity building that is also well underway.
We talked broadly about other indicators, one of the most important being how we protect the most vulnerable Californians, how we protect people in congregate care facilities, in our skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, other adult and senior licensed facilities throughout the State of California. We have well in excess of 8,500 of these facilities in the state, the SNFs, the skilled nursing facilities, represent 1,224 but thousands more in home settings, as many as two, three people, some six or seven in size all throughout the State of California.
We’ve updated you on a consistent basis about our efforts in that place and the sincere concerns we have, demonstrable concerns we have, about protecting our seniors in those facilities. We continue to focus on that above and beyond anything else as it relates to the data that comes in every morning because of the vulnerability of those populations. But real strategies, real plans in that place give us some more confidence that we’re moving in the right direction.
Accordingly, we’re doing the same for our homeless population. Another sensitive needs population that we have, as you know, advanced a series of announcements, particularly Project Room Key, partnership with FEMA to provide 15,000 hotel rooms. We already have acquired 12,500 hotel rooms in that portfolio. Thousands of individuals off the streets, out of congregate shelters, into these isolated units. Support on site, particularly three meals a day, being provided. This is among many, many different homeless strategies throughout the State of California. It’s just one that we have consistently highlighted in that space.
We are doing more as well in another indicator. That’s obviously securing the surge capacity within the hospital system and outside of the hospital system, these alternative care sites that we have brought up. We’ve talked about the FMS sites, close to 2000 rooms we were able to draw down with support of the federal government. The work that we’ve been doing collectively and collaboratively with cities and counties all up and down the state to provide assets as points of surge, if necessary, to address any increase in hospitalization, increase in need for isolation of vulnerable populations.
We feel we have done justice in that effort. Because of your good work on physical distancing, social distancing, because you have overwhelmingly abided by the stay-at-home order, you bought us time to put together those assets. Not only those physical assets, but begin the process of procuring a workforce through that health core adaptation in the workforce that we have now identified for a potential surge. Those individuals that have come back from retirement or willing to come back from retirement or people that have particular job skills that they believe can be transferred to meet the needs. We’ve got a matching system, and we’ve got that capacity now in place.
So physical sites, human resource sites, and now some more good news on PPE. Yesterday we announced the 3.1 million masks that arrived on Saturday night. We have distributed 2.87 million of those 3.1 million masks to our regional sites throughout the State of California. Another plane is literally taking off today. It will be landing tomorrow, and we will be getting subsequent shipments. So PPE is beginning to loosen up. Not even close to where it needs to be, and I recognize that. I can just assure you the reason we put 2.87 million masks out yesterday is that was back orders just in the healthcare space.
We want to broaden that beyond just the healthcare space, provide those masks and protective gear for people that are doing testing and make sure they’re adequately supplied. Make sure people that are on the front lines, grocery workers are adequately supplied. Clearly our skilled nursing homes, in-home supportive services and across the panoply of our sectors that we’ll talk about in a moment, to make sure that they have adequate supplies. But progress in that indicator is also being made.
We talked about another indicator, therapeutics, and I just want to remind folks that California, like Massachusetts, New Jersey, like a few states, is well-endowed, well-resourced in the therapeutics space. I’ll remind people, in California and outside California, that the State of California is the birthplace of biotech. Our life science capacity is second to none in biotherapeutics, bioinnovation, medical devices, San Diego, the Bay area. We are very blessed. The number of National Institute of Health funded facilities in this state is a point of envy for many other parts of the globe, not just across this country.
As a consequence, we are in advanced trials with our partners in the private sector working with our UC medical centers and other medical centers, and there is real progress in terms of at least the capacity of understanding in this space. I’m not going to promote any particular drug or particular trial, but just as an example, remdesivir and their advanced trials happening in this state in partnership with Gilead, who is a state-based headquartered company, Genentech and others. In this space, we are making progress at least in understanding what’s real and what’s not in the therapeutic space with, again, points of consideration, always caution in that space. But that’s one of our other indicators that’s important.
Today again, we’ll highlight the issues around business and schools and childcare centers, but before I get to that, briefly, I want to just mention that other indicator, that sixth indicator. That is if we pull back and we modify our state-at-home order too early and we start to see an increase in surge in cases, hospitalizations and spread, then we have to have the ability to toggle back. We have to have the ability to adjust. We have to have the ability to fix it, and so that’s a foundational indicator, number six, in terms of our capacity to deliver on the promise, what we’re promoting today in this roadmap for reopening.
So forgive me for being long-winded in that space, but I wanted to, again, contextualize the framework. Six indicators. When those turn green, when they move from red to yellow, it guides our decision-making and allows us to make determinations. Dates don’t, but data does. So let me as now I introduce this fifth indicator, again, none are prioritized but it happens to be the fifth indicator, around businesses and around issues of our schools and childcare centers.
I want to make this clear. We believe we are weeks, not months, away from making meaningful modifications to that indicator and in this space. Weeks, not months. You’ll ask me, well, is weeks one week or three weeks? Weeks, not months. Again, based upon the data, based upon the indicators. We’ll talk specifically about hospitalizations and ICUs and community spread.
Dr. Angell will come up in a moment, and she’ll show you our model, the graph of actuals, so you can see the stability in that space. But we’re still by no stretch of the imagination out of the woods there. It’s just stable. We’re not seeing substantial declines. But again, California and Californians know we never experienced the big surge that other parts of the globe and certainly other parts of our country had. But the stabilization is a point of some cautious optimism, and that indicator allows us to make the presentation that we’re making today.
So let’s talk specifically about what we’re talking about over the course of the next few weeks to think about and to consider and more importantly to plan for in real time. Those are areas of our economy. Let’s talk with business around manufacturing of non-essential materials, logistics for non-essential movement, areas around retail, i.e. curbside retail for non-essential items, issues that have been broadly defined around the need to address our kids in schools.
We clearly have shut down. People are well aware of this. The schools are shut down for the remainder of the school year. Learning continues at home, distance learning and the like, but we recognize there’s been a learning loss because of this disruption. We’re concerned about that learning loss even into the summer. So we are considering the prospect of an even earlier school year into the fall, as early as late July, early August. So we are beginning to socialize that. We have made no decisions definitively in that space, but I just want folks to know the concern around learning loss and the concern about waiting until later in the year into the fall for the new school year.
As a parent myself and having talked to many other parents and educators, even the kids, I think we might want to consider getting that school year moved up a little bit. So that’s one of the things that we want to begin to socialize in this indicator. We need to prepare for that, and we need to start preparing for the physical changes in the schools and the environmental changes in the schools that are necessary in order to advance that conversation and make it more meaningful. Accordingly, in the child care space itself.
We are able to make these, again, announcements and begin to have a more public conversation with you about opening up with adaptation and with modification, meaningful changes to our stay- at-home order, again, because people have taken seriously, overwhelmingly the stay-at-home orders and physical distancing. But I want to caution everybody if we pull back too quickly and we walk away from our incredible commitment to not only bend this curve but to stop the spread and suppress the spread of this virus, it could start a second wave that could be even more damaging than the first and undo all of the good work and progress that you’ve made.
That can happen like this. The virus has not gone away. Its virulence is still as acute. Its ability to be transmitted still is dominant, and so we, by no stretch, are out of the woods. There is durability to this virus, and there may be, we’ll see, seasonality. So we could be lulled into this quiet sense of confidence, change our behavior, put ourselves at risk and put this broader agenda of reopening with modification at risk.
So again, I caution everybody as I will be doing, I assure you, on a daily basis of the importance of our individual behavior, not just governmental behavior, individual behavior, and to the extent business is making decisions and modifications of our business leaders, men and women on the front lines, entrepreneurs, not just organized business advocates of the importance and power of their individual decision making in this space as well. We need to protect not just the business community but customers of those businesses.
It’s one thing to open a business, but if there’s no demand, it’s a false promise. As someone who has had the privilege of starting many, many businesses, I recognize that I’m not a job creator. It’s our consumers. It’s the people spending the money that create the opportunity for growth and job creation. So I deeply want to emphasize the importance of protecting customers and, of course, one of the business’s foundational resources, most fundamental, and that’s workers.
At the same time, we’re protecting businesses as entities in the abstract. But again, I am deeply sensitive to the needs for the business community to at least get some clarity. We’re trying to provide that over the next few weeks so they can start to plan and look at their own supply chains, look at their own ability to change the physical environmental conditions in their businesses, and look at the guidelines that we’ll be advancing very specifically and prescriptively sector-by-sector for guidance on what we can do and what we can’t do at this stage.
We are not going back to the way things were until we get the kind of immunity that all of us look forward to or a vaccine that we look forward to. So one has to be cautious in this space but also patient in this space as well. But in patience, we recognize in the imperative to meet that impatience in a pragmatic and thoughtful way is why Dr. Angell will be up in a moment to talk more specifically about these new phases that we’ll be rolling out with this indicator.
Let me briefly introduce those phases as I introduce Dr. Angell. We have looked at this indicator, and we looked at it through the prism of four phases. Phase one we’re currently in, which is planning, workflow, focusing again on supply chains, physical and environmental considerations. The planning to do what we need to do on PPE, the planning we need to do to make sure the conditions are set so that we can move forward with modifications of the stay-at-home for businesses as one example.
As we move into phase two, where businesses can begin to reopen, we need to make sure that that guidance is abided by and it is organized in a very deliberative way. That-
… and it is organized in a very deliberative way. That’s the job of Dr Angell. It’s her statewide guidelines that will drive the decision making.
Same time though we want to drive localism. I’ve often said, forgive me for repeating myself again on this and that is localism is determinative in this respect. I recognize the regionality in this state, the variants in different parts of the state, but I also recognize in that respect local health departments have points of view that must be considered as well. And so for example, the Bay Area announced today extending their stay at home order through the end of the month. I am not here as governor to make an announcement preempting their right at the local level to be even more stringent. I’m going to respect that and I want folks to know, not just in those six Bay Area counties, a few extra cities, that’s the case, but all across the state of California.
Accordingly, we have a regional variance that we also want to recognize for people that want to go even sooner based upon regional conditions. And I’m well aware. I’m being received memory letters, most of them very publicly provided to me in tweets, in public pronouncements even before I had the privilege of reading them personally. I recognize a lot of those regions are, are moving forward, making their recommendations. Dr Angell will talk about what the expectations we have of making any regional augmentations. They’re going to be stringent. We’re not just because people think they’re ready to reopen, even more loosely than the state guidelines, we’re not going to just blithefully do that without, for example, community surveillance obligations that are attached to those regional efforts. Dr Angell could talk more about the seven that are currently underway, the five that we will be doing very soon, and 12 different counties in total, but community surveillance becomes foundational if we’re going to loosen on a regional basis any of these new guidelines that we’ll be rolling out over the next few weeks.
So that’s phase one and phase two. Again, retail logistics, manufacturing, nonessentials, schools that we began in the summer and preparation, the early falls. Childcare facilities and centers with strict physical distancing and environmental considerations at hand. Workforce protections, customer consumer protections.
There’s a third and fourth phase, just four phases. The third phase is personal care. It’s the areas around, well a lot of discussion around gyms and spas, and nail salons, and people wanting to get haircuts. All of us. Those would fall into the third phase category. Dr Angell again will lay out some details on that and then of course ultimately the fourth phase, which are these highest risk activities. Not the higher risk activities in stage three, the highest risk activities, that’s the larger public venues. The conventions, the concerts, the larger entertainment venues with crowds that would be in that category. Don’t want to get ahead of myself. She’ll walk you through those four phases. Phase two is really the phase that is upon us we believe in the next few weeks and perhaps most important in terms of at least getting everybody’s attention and focus so that we can prepare for it and real time.
I’ll just close before I put Dr Angell and just say this. When I say prepare in real time what we’re doing, I mentioned yesterday, I’ll be doing it right after this press conference and this presentation, we’ll be meeting sector by sector with our recovery economic recovery team. We’ll be meeting today on the retail sector with some of the biggest retailers, some of the well known brands like the Gap CEO will join us, but with small businesses, small retail sector to help them help us work on the guidelines for this second phase that again, we’re hoping to advance in the next few weeks. So that’s just an example of the work we’re going to have to do sector by sector every day over the next days and weeks in order to prepare for this augmentation, this modification to the stay at home order.
So I’ve spoken long enough. Forgive me. A lot of what I said will be said much more definitively and succinctly and most likely eloquently by Dr Angell, who I’m proud is here to make her presentation. We’ll follow up of course with questions and I’ll do my daily update as briefly as I possibly can.
With that, dr Angell.
Now we’ve opened recently the hundred million dollars that we put into the sector and emergency aid. You’re correct, 50 million of it was for PPE. Getting those out on the sites to the sites is critical and can’t come soon enough, and so that was highlighted. Kim Johnson, to answer your question, at the Department of Social Services, on the line, she’s working to monitor the distribution of those funds and make sure that the advocacy of those funds takes shape. It’s not just for PPE, it’s for deep sanitization and for physical modifications just temporary to accommodate for new size cohorts based upon our guidance for childcare workers and for their children.
This is a point of passion for me. Last year in January, announced a substantial enhancement in childcare funding in the state of California. And just as late as January of this year announced our next phase of investment with the budget deficits looming. I caution that the progress in that space may be impeded by the new reality of our obligation to balance a budget. No printing press here in the state of California.
And so I can assure you this is an area of deep concern and concentrated effort because childcare is economic development. Childcare is foundational to getting people back to work. If they cannot get the kind of quality childcare that they deserve, they are less likely to get back to work and jumpstart this economy. And so I deeply recognize there’s a reason it was incorporated into the business sector, the childcare component, the interrelationship between the two.
Well, I’ll let Dr. Ghaly put that model together, and has been updating on a weekly basis, that model, preemptively answering that question in real time, going back a few months.
But as it relates to the data in terms of our decision making, the reason we’re making the announcement today is regardless of our model, the facts that are coming in, the facts that are presenting themselves on ICUs, on hospitalizations, and spread, give us confidence in the next few weeks, we’re able to make these stage two adjustments.
Let me be specific, Doug, we want to get you back to work, or at least allow you more time to work sooner than later. Our kids have lost a lot with this disruption. I am not naive. We announced a week or so ago, my wife and the superintendent public education, some good work that’s been done on new wifi hotspots, on distance learning, the application support of thousands, over 70,000 tablets and Chromebooks and other capacity, to provide distance learning. Still inadequate to the magnitude of six million children all throughout the state of California in rural districts and in some urban districts that just simply don’t have the high quality download speed and capacity or anything to download into.
And so there’s been a learning loss. And you can either just roll over and just accept that or you can do something about it. So that’s our thinking. If we can maybe start up the school year a little earlier, that would help mind that gap a little bit, close that gap a little bit. It’s a deep conversation. The reason I’m having it with you is I was having it privately over the last few days. I want to socialize those private conversations as quickly as I can with you.
I mentioned over the next few weeks, this is in the stage two of our framework of decision making. So the next few weeks, we’ll get some more clarity to answer your question on the possibility of that, what the costs are, what that actually looks like. It’s a conversation above and beyond just summer school. With that, I’ll ask Dr. Ghaly to come up.
Decisions not conditions, again, determine our fate and future. And that’s why I just want to mind everybody have their own individual decisions, importance of physical distancing, continue to advance the stay at home order. If we make bad decisions, conditions can radically change. Models can change overnight. Actuals, reality is radically impacted, again, by those individual decisions. Hundreds, hundreds a day, millions, millions of people marching, we hope, in the right and same direction, we’ll get out of this sooner if we maintain that directive sense of focus and continue to advance our commitment and resolve.
Oh, a lot more. It’s not enough, that’s the honest truth. I’ve been very clear with the testing task force. One of their top priorities was focusing on all of our licensed facilities, not just skilled nursing facilities. As you know, we’ve made three or four announcements in the skilled nursing facility and licensed facility space, including increasing the testing as a priority in that space, increasing the supply of PPE in that space, and as you know, redirecting National Guard to help support medical guardsmen and women in that space, including folks from the USNS Mercy. We retrained over 600 nurses. We’re doing those daily check-in calls. We have organized ourselves in a much more thorough and deliberative way.
We’re currently, Sophia, just to update you, we’re monitoring 192 skilled nursing facility sites that have a test positive, either a staff member or a patient. Currently, 2,302 individuals that we’re currently monitoring just in the SNF space. Again, that’s a universe of 1,224 skilled nursing facilities, about 119,000 total capacity. It doesn’t include total number of staff. Forgive me for throwing those numbers out except I think they’re important.
But the answer to your question is we need to do more, and this is part of moving from phase one to phase two. It’s one of the principle indicators on testing that will allow us to continue to make some real progress.
Yeah, as it relates to independent branch of government, legislature, they’ll make their decisions based upon their best assessment and analysis. I know that I’m aware of those decisions. In fact, I had a brief conversation with the speaker today. I haven’t been tracking it as closely as I’ve been tracking all of these other decisions, but I respect whatever determination they make, and have the confidence in their leadership to make the right decision for their members and those that they’re trying to represent in the state of California.
As it relates to the UI issues and the PUA issues, we’ve been very aggressive on a daily basis, as you know, to try to tackle, and as quickly as we can, to address the magnitude of the number of calls that have come in. Yesterday, I made some announcements about 600 additional personnel on top of the 1,340 that we had hired for the call centers. And we talked about the new texting technology. We talked about the new chat bots that we put into place. We talked about the total number of connections that we actually have made, went from 417,000 minutes of individual talk time last week to 1 million just yesterday from the previous week. So substantial increase in connection and volume.
$5.3 billion, that’s the new number. $5.3 billion has been distributed through that system just since March 15th. 926 million just on Sunday alone. I’ll repeat that, $926 million was distributed just on Sunday. So you’re correct. We have the PUAs up today, and not surprising, the first few hours we’ve got to figure this out, but we said we’d get it up today, and they’re putting it together. They’re architecting it today. Julie and her team at EDD doing everything in their power to continue to get these UIs out and start to get the PUAs up.
But here’s the good news on the PUAs, a lot of states have put up PUA sites. It’s just an application. Takes weeks and weeks to get the checks. Our expectation is not only when the site is more stable today and tomorrow, next few days, there’ll be 24 to 48 hour turnaround in terms of those checks being distributed. So you’re just dealing with unprecedented amount of call volume, and folks over at EDD, an unprecedented amount of responsibility and work to improve, to do better, to do more. You deserve that. Hank deserves that. The American people, 40 million strong in the state of California, particularly the 3.5 million that have applied for unemployment insurance since March 12th, and those that will be applying under the PUA deserve it. And so we’ll continue to to do all we can, everything in our power to improve upon that experience in these historic and unprecedented times.
And no, good enough never is. And yes, every day this is one of our top points of conversation, concern, and effort. And I can assure you that I’m not only being held to account, but some of the brightest people that I know are as well in this space.
Look, as it relates to being held to account, let us not be judged not to have been held in account of supporting others at need at this time of need for millions of Californians. It’s not just applying for unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, PUA, but also those that need your contribution of blood, maybe your willingness to just to call and check in on a neighbor, a senior, maybe deliver a meal in a safe way, or provide some care and support. Please, if you’re willing, you’re able, go to californiansforall.ca.gov, californiansforall.ca.gov website and share your passion with real action. Take everybody, stay safe. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow at noon.
",Gov. Gavin Newsom California COVID-19 Briefing Transcript April 28,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/gov-gavin-newsom-california-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-28
Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-02-11,"Thank you very much, El Paso. Thank you very much. Thank you. I am very, very thrilled to be here in the great State of Texas -- right on the banks of the legendary Rio Grande, where by the -- well, I don't know, you heard, right? Today we started a big, beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande. Right smack on the Rio Grande.
I love this state and I love the people of this state. We've had a great romance together. You know, that. It's been a great romance and we're only getting stronger together. That's what's happening. Wow, look at all the press back. You believe that. They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?
They've gone down. That was a long -- that was a long fall, but there they are. Last week I was honored to stand in the House Chamber to deliver the State of the Union -- and I asked both parties to come together to choose greatness for America. Since taking office two years ago our economy is now the hottest economy anywhere on Earth.
Our military, which desperately needed funding, we went $700 billion and $716 billion, is More powerful than ever before. That was not a good situation. It was tired and depleted. Our great warriors were not taken care of. Now they're taken care of again the way they should be. And America is winning again.
Isn't that nice? We're fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color, creed. We're fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for all Americans. And what is it, America first? Remember, it's America first.
Right? It's a mainstream, common sense agenda of the American people. It's where we want to be and where we want to go.
I don't get good -- I used to get great press until I decided to run for office. And we have done together, an incredible job. And a new poll just came out today Rasmussen, one of the most respected polls, one of the polls that got the election right, so I have to remember that, you know what the number is, 52 percent, with no good news.
Explain that. Explain that. Explain that. How do you get that when you don't get good press? I guess 93 percent of the stories are negative. No matter what we do, they figure out a way to make it bad. When I came in, North Korea was -- it looks like it was going to war.
You know that. It was going to happen, bad things. Now you have no missile launches. You have no rocket testing. You have no nuclear testing. I have a good relationship, maybe even a great relationship. We have tremendous sanctions on North Korea. But we have our hostages back. We have -- remains are coming back.
Remains. And our presidents have been dealing with North Korea for many, many decades, many, many decades. And on a nuclear way over the last 20, 30 years and all I hear is, ""Can't you move faster?"" You know what? I left Singapore 15 months ago, they've been negotiating for 85 years or something. So now their complaint is, ""What's taking him so long?"" I heard one of our great geniuses from a previous administration telling me how to negotiate with North Korea when they got taken advantage of like nobody I've ever seen before.
So some day, with all of us, this is all of us -- and those hats are beautiful, by the way -- Someday -- True. Someday they're going to appreciate us all. And I'm going to Vietnam, to Hanoi, in the near future, 27th and 28th of February, to have another summit and hope we -- hopefully we do as well with the second summit as we did with the first.
I hope so. Now, we're delighted and I'm delighted to be joined this evening by the Texas leaders. You have great leaders, great people, great help to me -- that are at the forefront of this incredible American Revolution. You know, there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. We have to understand.
There's never been. If you would say, as an example, that tonight, 69,000 people signed up to be here. Now, the arena holes 8,000, and thank you fire department, they got in about 10, thank you fire department, appreciate it. But if you want to really see something go outside, tens of thousands of people are watching screens outside.
Tens of thousands. And we were all challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz. Hey, you're supposed to win in order to run. By the way, we, I, we, I'm one and one, I'm one for one. Think of it. We had one election, we won, now we're going to be 2 for 0 and everything's going to be perfect.
But a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name, he has -- he challenged us. So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good. In fact, what I do, what I would do is I would say, ""that may be the end of his presidential bid,"" but he did challenge us. So I want to introduce some great people.
Your Governor, Greg Abbott. Greg. Where is he? Where's Greg? Thank you Greg. And a great governor and a great friend of mine. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Thanks Dan. Thank you Dan. Look at him in the corner, so shy. Thank you Dan. Great job, Dan. Attorney General Ken Paxton. Thanks, Ken. And Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller.
Thank you, Sid. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, Ken. Great job you do. And we're especially grateful to your wonderful Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Great Senators. We have a lot of them. Are you already? And they're terrific. And they've been with us all the way.
Pete Olson. Pete. Thanks, Pete. Thank you, Pete. Michael Burgess. Thanks Michael. John Carter. Brian Babin. And Randy Weber. Thank you very much. We are in the midst of an economic miracle. That's what's happened. You look all over the world and you study and you see what's going on. You can look at China.
We have a team right now in China, they want to make a deal very badly. Those tariffs are costing them a lot of money and they're going into our Treasury, remember that, we're filling up with billions of dollars. And did you see the, you know, I haven't been here very long, the trade deficit really went down very big this last month, and people are saying, ""Whoa."" I told you so. That's what I do. That's what I do. And we don't want China to have a hard time.
Thank you. Thank you. I -- I can only tell you this, we're going to make great deals on trade. We're going to make great deals on military. When we defend another nation that's rich they have to help us out. Do we agree? They have to help us out. And they're doing it. They're doing it. You saw South Korea, they were paying us $500 million a year.
I say you got to do more. You got to give more. Anyway. Now they're up to almost $900 million, that was like a do phone calls. I said -- I said, ""Why didn't they do this before?"" They said, ""Nobody ever asked. Nobody asked."" You pick up almost $500 million a year, nobody asked. We're defending rich countries, they've got to help us out, folks.
They've got help us out, sorry. And you know what? They're going like us more and maybe more importantly, they going to respect us. Since the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing was dead? They said manufacturing was dead, the previous administration.
You'll never have it. You need the magic wand. That's what they said. We obviously, we found the magic wand. And by the way, those numbers is small compared to what's happening, compared to all of the companies that are moving in. Thank you.
The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have reached the lowest level in the history of our country. Thank you. Are you all right? Everything okay? Please. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And women have filled almost 60 percent of the new jobs created last year, which were a record number.
We passed massive tax cuts for working families and we canceled a record number of job killing regulations. That's why your oil and gas is coming back. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate. And to give critically ill patients access to life saving treatments, we did something that they haven't been able to do for a long time, we passed Right To Try.
Right To Try. That's an incredible thing, Right To Try. You know, we have the greatest doctors and research in the world, and if somebody was terminally ill they traveled to Asia, they traveled to Europe, they'd travel all over the world, if they had the money. If they didn't have the money, they'd just go home, there was nothing they could do. And I said, ""Wait a minute.
We have drugs in the pipeline that are showing tremendous progress. If somebody is terminally ill let's let them have access to our drugs. Let's let them have access."" And it's much tougher than you would think. But we got it and people, you will not understand, nobody understands, the lifesaving effects, it's incredible what's going on. They are getting better.
People are getting better that were thinking they were going to die. It's right to try, I love it. I always wondered why we didn't do it before? Now, the people in Texas won't care much about this, but the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. I didn't think you'd care about that.
I didn't think Texas would care about that. And listen to this, and Texas oil production is now at the highest level it's ever been. And only for the great oil professionals in the room, we're getting those pipelines approved so fast you'll be able to practically double up on oil production, oil and gas.
They're getting approved at record levels and record time, that means more money, more security, and more independence for our country -- it's very simple. Another one they said could never get passed, they've been trying to do it for 40 years, we passed VA Choice, Veterans Choice.
Where do they come from? They go back home to Mommy. They get punished when they get home. But before we get to the Wall, so VA Accountability and VA Choice. Accountability, we couldn't fire anybody from the Veterans Administration.
We couldn't fire anybody. They could treat our veterans badly. We had to take it. Now, you get rid of them. And VA Choice, they'd wait online for days and weeks, they couldn't see a doctor. Now, they go out, they have a choice. They get a private doctor. They have things taken care of and we pay their bill.
They've been trying to get those two things fixed for many, many decades, many years and we got it fixed. We also passed the Farm bill for wonderful farmers, ranchers, and growers. Just got it. We just got it passed and that was it easy but we got it passed. We had to do it. Our farmers are great. So we just get that done, farmers, ranchers, growers.
And we passed historic legislation to combat the Opioid Crisis. Is there any place that's more fun to be that a Trump rally, is there any place? You know, they all said, ""Mr. President, we loved the tone of your State of the Union speech."" Some people said it was a great speech.
Some people said, ""Really a great speech."" I said, ""But if I ever did that in El Paso, Texas, it wouldn't work here too well,"" do you agree? Nice and calm. No, that's not what you're looking for. This is more fun. This is more fun. And we just signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. Nobody thought that was going to be happening.
In my address last week, I asked lawmakers in both parties to cross the aisle and join together for the common good for all Americans. Democrats have to stop being so angry. They're angry. And they've got to start being partners to keep this -- really, look, is just an incredible miracle that's going on? We want to keep it going.
Keep it going, and it will keep going. It will keep going. There's so much to celebrate in our country, the economy, the military, so many things we've done scientifically. The world is trying to copy what we've done, they're not going to be able to do it. Not anymore. They were catching up fast, now they're going in the wrong direction.
Wrong direction. Unfortunately, many of the Democrats in Congress responded to my call for bipartisan cooperation by instead choosing really -- hey, look, did you ever see anything -- radical resistance, it's the radical left. But maybe it'll change. It all has to do with 2020 and the election.
But I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of ""Let's hop a train to California. You know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems. But nobody's ever had this. And by the way with us, we handle it. No president should ever have to go through what we've gone through in the first two years.
It's a hoax. It's a disgrace, and it should never be allowed to happen again. A hoax. Just recently, as an example, Senator Richard Burr, from the great State of North Carolina. He's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years. They've interviewed over 200 people.
They've studied hundreds of thousands of documents and pages and Richard just announced that they found no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia collusion. The fact is, that the real collusion was between Hillary and the Democrats and the other side with Russia, that's where the collusion is. That's where the collusion is.
But that's where the collusion is, with the Democrats, and with Russia, and with others. And by the way, there's also collusion between the Democrats and the fake news right here. Too many Democrats are focused on tearing down their opposition instead of building up our country.
They're trying to impose some of the most extreme measures and policies ever put forward by our Congress. And by the way, I don't think anybody in this room wants to pay 70, 80, 90 and 95 percent tax. Does anybody want to pay a 90 percent tax.
We are a hot, hot country. Last week they introduced a massive government takeover that would destroy our incredible economic gains. They introduced the so-called Green New Deal.
It would shut down a little thing called air travel."" ""Yes, I like it very much."" Oh, really, how are we getting to Hawaii on a train. She'll figure it out.
They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion, you have to spend $100 trillion -- And remember this, no other country except us is going to do it. That's a little problem, too.
While the world's real polluters, like China, would get many of our companies and factories, they'd just move into China, move into other parts of the world. That's the way the system works. It's not going to happen folks. Don't worry, it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. $100 trillion. Let's spend $100 trillion.
Let's rip down every building in New York City and rebuild it environmentally slightly better. To pave the way for socialism, Democrats are calling for massive tax hikes and the complete elimination of private health care. Many of us have private health care. That means you can stand on line for five days as you wait for a doctor that is not nearly as talented as your doctor.
Remember? ""You can keep your doctor."" Remember that? 28 times, ""You can keep it."" That didn't happen. It turned out to be alive. Hey, where are the fact checkers? You know, some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers. 28 times, ""You can keep your doctor."" That didn't turn out to be what he said.
They're coming for your money and they're coming for your freedom and it'll never happen and it won't even come close, folks. Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion. What's that all about?
So in Virginia, the governor, he's got a little publicity lately. It keeps us out of the papers. I like it. I'd like to find a few more guys like this one. He almost moon walked. His wife stopped him, ""Darling, that would be inappropriate."" I want to see somebody trying to imitate Michael Jackson in the moonwalk.
This would not have been a good scene. His wife saved him, darling, this would be inappropriate."" I think she was right. But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable. And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby.
Execute the baby. Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them and we will. That is why last week I go I called on Congress, with your great congressman over there -- thank you, fellas -- to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.
And that certainly is extreme. Many people never even heard of it. I mean, have you ever even hear of anything like this. By the way, that state's going to go Republican pretty soon, I'm pretty sure -- because the Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream.
They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders, and crime.
Can you believe this. I don't think so. Okay. I don't think so. And I want to thank our ICE offices.
What they put up is incredible and that includes Border Patrol and that includes law enforcement. Let's face it. Law enforcement, we love them. They keep us safe. In the last two years alone, ICE officers have made 200, listen to these numbers, 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 40,000, 40,000 larcenies 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 12,000 vehicle thefts, 11,000 robberies, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders.
-- murders, murders, killings, murders. We will. If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country. Slashing ICE tension is the first step of many for the far left, I call them the radical left We will never abolish ICE.
They want to abolish ICE. We're never going to abolish ICE. So let me say very clearly to those pushing this ridiculous and radical agenda, I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country. And I will never abolish or in any way mistreat our great heroes from ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement, never.
We will always stand with those brave men and women. We will always be with them. We're going to take care of them just like they take care of us, remember that. Now, I have to tell you, as I was walking up to the stage they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the Wall anyway.
They say that progress has been made, interesting. Just now. Just now. I said, ""Wait a minute. I got to take care of my people from Texas. I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it."" I don't want to hear it. So I don't know what they mean ""progress is being made significant"". Now, what did happen is the Democrats were being hit really hard on the concept of releasing criminals into our society, that has not been playing well.
So maybe progress is being made, maybe not. But I had a choice, I could have stayed out there and listened or I could have come out to the people of El Paso in Texas. I chose you. I chose you. So -- so we probably have some good news. But who knows? Who knows? We'll -- we're -- we're setting the stage folks.
You know what it's called, right? It's called with setting the stage. We're setting the table. We're doing whatever we have to do the walls being built, it'll continue. It's going at a rapid pace. The Rio Grande, it's happening, go check it out. We proudly welcome those who come lawfully, and support our values in the United States, and that want to strengthen our society and help us with all of the companies moving into the United States, moving back, they left us now they're moving back, many of them, in some cases, maybe all of them, but they all want to come back because the United States is where the action is, very simple.
It's where the action is. And it is -- we're most proud of the fact, you look at the car companies, they're moving back. They're going into Michigan. They're going into Pennsylvania. They're going back to Ohio. So many companies are coming back. And by the way, that's why I want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit.
Through merit, so they can help us build our country. Make America Great Again, pretty soon we're going to be saying, Keep America Great, Keep America Great. Pretty soon. Pretty soon, congressman, Keep America Great. We'll have to switch over. Tell me, tell me, the campaign's sort of started because you have these people that nobody ever heard of, they're all running for office.
I said, ""Who is that?"" ""Well, that person was a mayor of a city that was defeated."" Well, how about Beto, Beto was defeated to, right. Watch what the news does tomorrow, though, they won't mention the disparity. They won't mention the disparity tomorrow. They'll say, ""Beto O'Rourke,"" That's his last name, right, O'Rourke?
Beta O'Rourke had a wonderful rally of about 15 people.
It's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy but look at them, they still come. I've never said anything like it. But illegal immigration hurts all Americans, including millions of legal immigrants, by driving down wages, draining public resources, and claiming countless innocent lives. You see what's going on, folks.
You know what's going on. They give you all of these phony stats they say, ""Oh, it's the same. It's the same."" It's not the same. It's a bad situation going on and we've stopped it. We are taking out thousands and thousands of people from MS-13, we're bringing them to hell out of our country, thousands. But if we had proper border security, including a very powerful wall, we wouldn't have to work so hard and it would be a lot safer and a lot better.
My Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration, while modernizing our legal immigration system, which has been in terrible shape for many, many decades to prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves for them actually and contribute to our economy, people that come in on merit, merit, merit -- instead of random lotteries and chain migration.
Chain migration, that's another beauty.S. born, everybody's going to be happy. And we need the people to take care of these companies that are moving. Our unemployment rate, real unemployment, 3.6, 3.7 -- and going down, had a little blip because of a thing called the shutdown.
But remember, it went up to 4.0. I said, ""Boy, that's -- "" Do you know how low 4.0 is? Do you know anybody else, any other president that would have said, ""Please give me 4.0, please.7 to 4.0, just quickly. But you know what? If we didn't do that shutdown we would not have been able to show this country these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border.
That was a very important thing we did. And the fact is, illegal immigration is a heartbreaking human tragedy. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the very long and dangerous journey north up to our country. Sex traffickers, these are the worst human beings on Earth, exploit our porous border to sell young girls and women into modern day slavery.
You wouldn't even know that, nobody knows that. And by the way, do you think they come in through the ports of entry."" They don't do that. They drive out where there's no barrier, no wall, they make a left.
Congratulations, you're in the United States. That's all. If you have three women tied up in the backseat of a car, you're not going through, folks, a port of entry where they do look in the backseat, at least, right? Drugs pouring through the border kills tens of thousands of innocent Americans a year, including heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, and so many others.
They come through the Southern border. We have a drug problem over the last 6, 7, 10 years like we have never had before. We can have such a big cut in the numbers, in the percentages, if we get the Wall built -- if we have a strong Wall with other things, but we need the Wall and it has to be built and we want to build it fast.
The number of illegal immigrants crossing our borders is so large that we've know where to hold them. We have to build -- they want buildings, they want jails. They want, these people, how about the word caravan. Where you have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras, and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico.
And by the way, if we didn't have walls in those areas, in some cases that we put up, in many cases where we reinforced, in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire -- you would have people pouring in. They don't pour in. The problem is our laws are so bad that there's no way we can quickly remove them.
Other countries say, ""Get out of here."" We have to bring them through a court system. We sign their names, they touch our land, we sign them up, we explained to them, ""Please come back in six years for court,"" and only the dumbest people show back up. Nobody ever shows up. Nobody comes back in, like 2 percent.
They go in to our country. The good news is we have great law enforcement and many of these people, we know where they are, and we're going to get them the hell out. But we have to change our laws. So right now we have a backlog. You won't even believe this. Other countries don't do this.
Nobody else does that. Other countries say, ""Get out. You can't come in. You're not a citizen of whatever country."" We bring them in. So listen to this, right now we have almost 900,000 cases, 900,000. How many judges are going to take care of -- we're going to have to hire tens of thousands of judges to do that, 900,000 cases.
How stupid is this? This was a system put in place by really dumb people or people that did not have the best interests of our country at heart. And there's no place better to talk about border security, whether they like it or not, because I've been hearing a lot of things,"" Oh, the Wall didn't make that much of a difference."" You know where it made a big difference?
Right here in El Paso. And I've been watching where they've been trying to say, ""Oh, the Wall didn't make that much -- "" Well you take a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to a much lesser, you take a look at what the real system is. I spoke to people that have been here a long time they said, ""When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game."" Is that a correct statement?
A whole different ball game. I'll give you another example. And I don't care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they're full of crap when they say it has it made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, ""Oh, crime actually stayed the same."" It didn't say the same, it went way down and look at what they did to their past crimes and look at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down.
These people, you know, you'd think did want to get to the bottom of a problem and solve a problem, not try and pull the wool over everybody's eyes. So for those few people that are out there on television saying, ""Oh, it didn't make too much of a difference,"" it made a -- people from El Paso, am I right?
It's fake news. It's fake. I'm telling you, just fake news. And you know what? You wouldn't even have to know you can say that automatically without even knowing it. It's obvious, it's common sense. Just a few thousand feet, as an example, from where we stand right now on the other side of the border, it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Juarez, Mexico.
Well, the people at Juarez agree. Yet, thanks to a powerful border wall and El Paso, Texas it's one of America's safest cities now. Now, listen to the this, so you're talking a few feet away, right, a few feet, got a wall, a few feet away. Last year Juarez had 1,200 murders, El Paso, right next door, a few feet away, had 23 murders.
That's not good either. But 23 compared to 1,200. Walls work, actually there's nothing like them for what we're talking about. We want to stop drugs. We want to stop traffickers. We want to stop criminals from coming in, walls save lives. Walls save tremendous numbers of lives. The biggest proponents of open borders are rich liberals and wealthy donors.
These are hypocrites who oppose security for you while living their entire lives -- I do it too, to be honest with you, I'm guilty. I'm guilty. I also live behind walls, okay. They live behind walls and gates in their guards all over the place. Me too, because I want to be safe and I want to make America safe, if you don't mind.
So security should not belong only to the rich and to the powerful, safety is the birthright of every American, which is why we must finish the Wall. It's happening. Because walls are not immoral, as it was said, human trafficking is immoral.
Child smuggling is immoral.
When you look at the drugs that are pouring across from Mexico, if it stopped a small percentage, and it won't, it'll stop a large percentage, it would pay for itself in a matter of weeks. That's the kind of numbers you're talking about, a matter of weeks. And by the way, I -- I hate to say this, because we have a very good relationship, but Mexico had the highest number of killings that they've ever had, almost 40,000 people were murdered in Mexico.
Mexico is not too far away, and we need to take care of our people and we're going to do that and it's happening and it's happening a lot faster than anybody thought. And I love that sign. Thank you. What we're proposing includes humanitarian assistance, drug detection at our ports and everywhere else, closing legal loopholes, which is a big problem, and plans for a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier or wall, let's call it a wall, it's better.
This wall will be built in the areas identified by border agents is having the greatest need while safely directing people and commerce to our many lawful ports of entry, which we're beefing up in every way, structurally, with beefing up the ports of entry and mechanically. We have equipment now that can spot drugs.
It's incredible stuff. It's expensive. It's incredible. By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German Shepherd. It's hard to believe, right. It's true you know, I -- I was with the people and they're showing me this incredible computerized stuff and where it goes. I said ""Could I -- ""Because Secret Service took me out to the place and they were showing me these German Shepherds, they're unbelievable.
They'll run past all these empty boxes and one of the boxes has drugs in it, deep down in a box and they come to a screeching halt barking at it every time. So I asked the people that sell the machinery, at a lot of money, so I said, ""Let me ask you a question. This stuff is incredible. I'm really impressed.
How does it compare to a German Shepherd?"" The guy looks at and says, ""Sir, honestly, it's not as good."" Can you believe it? A German Shepard. Certain types of dogs, pretty good. You do love your dogs, don't you? I wouldn't mind having one, honestly, but I don't have any time, I don't have -- How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn, would that be -- Right, sort of not for -- I don't know, it doesn't -- I don't feel good.
It feels a little phony-phony to me. A lot of people say, ""Oh, you should get a dog."" ""Why?"" ""It's good politically."" I said, ""Look, that's not the relationship I have with my people.
The American people have waited long enough. We must secure the border, pass Kate's Law -- end Catch and Release, shutdown Sanctuary Cities -- you know, we need Democrat votes to do that -- deport criminal aliens, and keep the coyotes and traffickers and drug dealers the hell out of our country, please. And the Democrats also need to confirm the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are sitting in the Senate waiting for confirmation, people that have given up their lives to work in the Trump administration and the Democrats aren't approving them.
It's a record. It's a record of the history of our country there has never been -- Some people left the job a year and a half ago, two years ago, to become an ambassador or to work at one of our many great agencies and we can't get Schumer and his friends to approve them.
It's total obstruction. There's never been anything like it. Very, very unfair, very unfair to these people. In many cases, seriously, they've left jobs and they're waiting and waiting and waiting, they're slow walking every single one of them. It's a disgrace. As we fight to protect our borders we must also protect our newfound prosperity.
My administration has taken the toughest ever action to crack down on years of China's abuse and its trade practices have been very unfair. And I have a lot of respect for President Xi, but he's representing China and I'm representing the United States. We're also replacing one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever done, although I happen to think that the WTO is not so good either, we're replacing NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that everybody is loving.
We've got to get Congress to approve it. We've got to get Congress to approve. We'll get it, I think done. I mean, there's such obstruction in Congress, you know, they won't even do things that are good for our country now. They would rather have Trump have a loss than get something that's so good for our country.
Our farmers are happy, everybody's happy. And it's going to be jobs. You know, what it does? It stops companies from moving out. It makes it very hard economically for companies to say, ""Hey, thanks a lot. We're firing everybody, we're moving to Mexico."" Makes it very, very hard. You know, that's been a bone of contention for me for many years.
I've seen 25 percent and more of our automobile business move to Mexico and it's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Unless they want to pay nice big fat tariffs to send their cars back into this country We've achieved, and by the way, tariffs had have had an incredible effect. Just ask the folks in China, ""How are we doing with tariffs?"" You ask.
And you ask, ""How are we doing in our negotiations?"" The fact is, and I say it openly, either they treat us fairly or they have to pay for the privilege of coming in and taking our wealth and taking our jobs, it's very simple. It's very, very simple. And if you look back at our country when we were very rich, when we had no debt, when we had no problems economically, you take back -- you take a look, 1888, the Great Tariff Debate, you know the debate was about?
Our country had so much money they had to debate what the hell to do with all the money because tariffs were bringing in a fortune into the United States. So at a minimum, countries in negotiating with us very seriously because of the fact that they don't want to have to pay to come in and take advantage of our country, that's at a minimum.
Check it out, 188. Have the press check it out. They'll say, ""Donald Trump said 1888. And I'm asking Congress to work with me to make prescription drugs affordable for every American family. We just got the largest decrease in drug prices, think of that, and it's not easy, it's not easy.
Because we have middlemen that take care of a lot of people for a lot of years, these middlemen and the drug companies, but even worse, the middleman, and we're cutting the middleman out. they're not going to like be very much. They made a lot of money. But think of that, they're better the first time in 46 years.
And now we're going to phase three, we did one statutorily, we did two statutorily, now we go to phase three, we're getting your drug prices down. We're embarking on bald initiatives to defeat AIDS. Who knew that? We have medicines now that work wonders on AIDS. We're looking to be AIDS-free in not many years as a country and maybe help, also, the world, the world.
So we want to defeat AIDS and we want to feed childhood cancer. We've made tremendous strides. Tremendous strides. In the Middle East, are brave warriors have liberated virtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Now, you don't hear that from these people. Now, we've taken back -- soon it'll be announced soon, maybe over the next week, maybe less, but it'll be announced very soon -- we'll have 100 percent.
When I took over this country, it was a mess. And if I wouldn't have been elected -- You know, I have so many people, I was just walking up and every time it happens, ""Sir, thank you. Thank you very much."" This guy, he's -- he's like a monster. No, no, it's true. These people. This guy is like a monster.
He's like this monster football -- a big, strong guy. He says to me, he said, ""Thank you very much."" I don't know what they're saying, but that's okay. Now he's this big, strong guy and he's crying. And he said, ""Mr. -- "" I'm walking up and it happens all the time. ""Thank you very much, Mr. President."" I said, ""For what?"" He said, ""You've saved our country.
Our country was going in the wrong direction. You've saved our country. Thank you."" I've had so many people say that. So many people. You know what the truth is though? I didn't save our country, we're now heading in the right direction. It's very tough because we have so many things were fighting, including these people.
But so many people that we're finding, so many people that are either foolish or ill-intentioned. But you know, I didn't save our county, you know saved our country, you saved our country. You saved our country, and God. Because there's never -- nothing like this has ever happened before. And you know what?
The world is watching and when prime ministers, and when presidents, and kings and queens, they talked to me they say, ""Congratulations on what's happened with your economy, Mr. President, it's incredible."" They're emulating what we're doing. They can't believe it. So we continue to decimate the remnants, because they're always going to be remnants, we can take the area the land, we'll soon have 100 percent, but they're always remnants, they get out, they wrap themselves in bombs.
They're crazy. They're lunatics. But you're always going to have that. But we want to bring, now -- we've got 100 percent. It was so bad when I took over, it was going the opposite direction. Syria, we want to bring our troops back home. It's time. It's time. It's time. And thanks to the extraordinary service of our military in Afghanistan, 19 years we're in Afghanistan, we may now be able to seek a political resolution that, frankly, they've wanted to talk about for a long time.
We've hit them very hard, but it's been 19 years. Think of that, 19 years. We spend more on military in Afghanistan, $50 billion a year, than most countries spend on their entire country, healthcare, education, everything. We spend more than they do. It's time to start thinking smart for our country. What we want to build our country.
We want to spend money in our country. We want to build our roads, and highways, and bridges, and dams. And last month the United States recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime.
You take a look no matter where. Yet, there are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States. We will live free and we will die free.
We will always be free. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and our great rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American way.
We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our incredible history, and always respect our great American flag. We believe that the first duty of government is to be loyal to its citizens.
And we live by the words of our national motto that we are going to keep -- we'll never change this -- In God We Trust. These are the beliefs, traditions, and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as great patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the great State of Texas.
From Houston to Austin, from Dallas to El Paso -- from the Red River to the Rio Grande, the Lone Star State embodies the spirit of independence like maybe no other place anywhere in the world. And you have always embraced the cause of American Freedom like no one else. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo.
This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign, powerful army and declared, ""Come and take it."" Come on, come on, take it. Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, oil workers, and pioneers help build up the most extraordinary nation in all of human history.
That's what we are. We were losing track, we didn't lose track getting more, we're just great on that track. Now, just like generations of Texas patriots who came before, you are going to make your stand. That's what we've done, we've made our stand and we've made it together. This is a big group of millions and millions of people that have come together like never before in our history.
This has never happened before. And we've come for safety, for sovereignty, and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America. And together, with the proud and incredible and great people of the State of Texas, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you.
","Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in El Paso, Texas",https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-el-paso-february-11-2019
Jeff Rooker,United Kingdom,2020-02-18,"I hope that the hon. I propose to follow the custom of new Members by referring to my constituency. I represent Perry Barr, which ​ is in Birmingham. It is the northern wedge of Birmingham, and it is the place where I was born and raised and went to school. I am doubly proud to have been elected to serve the electors of that constituency.
There is very little industry in the constituency, and that is strange for such a large industrial city. Basically, it consists of housing, schools and a few shops. Except for half a dozen, most of the houses are post-1930. I suppose for some hon. Members that would be considered modern, notwithstanding that 50 per cent. of council houses still have outside sanitation—a state of affairs to be deplored in the age of Centre Point. I have promised my electors—and I intend to keep the promise, come what may—that I will not support public spending on grandiose schemes whilst outside sanitation exists.
Also in the constituency—and this may surprise hon. Members—there is the Convent of the Little Sisters of the Assumption, which is 400 years old. They do invaluable social work amongst the underprivileged families in the area.
There is also—not on the same site, I should add—a seminary for training Roman Catholic priests which is about 500 years old. These are located within the area of the Perry Barr constituency.
Most of my constituents work in the thousand-and-one trades for which Birmingham is noted, but the majority are probably involved in the motor industry. I shall return to this matter later in the remarks I wish to make concerning the Gracious Speech.
The Member I have replaced, Mr. Kinsey, worked hard on behalf of his constituents in Perry Barr and helped them to solve the problems that they encountered in the area. The fact that as a Member of this House he consistently voted against their best interests does not detract from the good work he did within the local community.
Hon. Members may remember that just prior to the General Election Mr. Kinsey achieved some notice, along with the hon.
The Gracious Speech refers to proposals on health and safety at work. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that many of the Government’s proposals had already been before the House and were included in the Queen’s Speech last November. I hope that is not so, because I do not believe we should support what the Conservative Government had in mind. The Conservative legislation was based almost completely on the report of the Robens Committee, published in July 1972. The main conclusion of that committee was that most industrial accidents at work are caused by the apathy of the workers. That is something else to blame on them. The accidents are their fault.
It was also said that the prime responsibility for doing something about the problem lay with those who created the risks and worked with them. Yet we lived until 28th February in an employer-dominated society in which those who worked with the risks did not have the capacity to do anything about them. The committee said that there was also too much law on industrial safety at work and that it needed reducing. That of course is at variance with the theme of the legislation on industrial relations and wage restraint introduced by the Conservatives. Nevertheless, I admit that the Labour Government do not have clean hands over wage restraint legislation.
The most frightening remark of that committee, which was taken to heart by the previous Government, was that it did not look upon the factory inspectorate ​ as a law enforcement agency. At the time I considered that to be a treasonable remark. I hope that my remarks will be seen to have an element of constructive criticism or comment in them about what I want our Bill to contain.
We want action to ensure that there will not be 500 deaths a year from accidents in industry. Ten people will be killed this week at work, yet, according to the Robens Report, their deaths must be attributed to the apathy of the workers. We want action to reduce the 30 million to 40 million working days lost every year through accidents. I spent 15 years in industry as a time-serving toolmaker’s apprentice and I also served time on the other side of industry, some of it as a safety officer. I know from experience that attempts are made to circumvent the regulations and not to report accidents which take place.
The only way to achieve progress in this respect is for those who work with the risks to have the statutory right to decide whether they will continue to work with them, and that means the safety officer should not be paid by the management but should be a worker who has the statutory right to investigate dangerous processes. When the question of compensation arises it means that we have failed because the accident will have happened and a man may have lost a life or part of a limb. Nevertheless, compensation is important. Our Bill must change the practice whereby serious breaches of the Factories Acts merely end up in a magistrates’ court with a £50 fine even when someone loses a hand or a foot. That sort of thing happens throughout industry, and it certainly happens in Perry Bar even though the constituency has little industry there. Such cases may be followed by about four or five years’ delay before compensation is paid through the courts when the plaintiff sues for negligence. The compensation is paid long after the time when it was badly needed.
The Bill must ensure that the problems that people from my constituency came across, one of whom died as a result of an accident, are dealt with. There was a struggle for years to establish that there had been an accident even though it was not recorded. The affair was covered up at the time, but an industrial accident ​ happened. I want the Bill to solve problems, such as the one involving Mr. Arthur Faulks, who now has only one lung because of the repeated occasions he was told to work in conditions where asbestos dust was prevalent.
I am opposed to the present rules governing industrial safety and welfare. New legislation is required, and I hope that we shall be able to give those who do the work the power over the process. Legislation planned by the previous Government did not provide for that, but I am hopeful that legislation proposed by the present Government will. If it does not, I shall not remain silent, neither will other hon. Members on the Government benches.
I thank the House for the time it has given to me and for the silence with which it has listened to me. I realise that I may not have made a conventional maiden speech. I did not attempt to do so, for there is an element of controversy in most matters and I did not wish to waste the opportunity to address the House on matters of vital importance to the area I represent.
",1974 Maiden Speech in the House of Commons,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/jeff-rooker-1974-maiden-speech-in-the-house-of-commons/
William Howard Taft,United States of America,1909-11-17 00:00:00,"It will be observed that the object of the revision under such a statement was not to destroy protected industries in this country, but it was to continue to protect them where lower rates offered a sufficient protection to prevent injury by foreign competition. That was the object of the revision as advocated by me, and it was certainly the object of the revision as promised in the Republican platform.
I want to make as clear as I can this proposition, because, in order to determine whether a bill is a compliance with the terms of that platform, it must be understood what the platform means. A free trader is opposed to any protected rate because be thinks that our manufacturers, our farmers, and our miners ought to withstand the competition of foreign manufacturers and miners and farmers, or else go out of business and find something else more profitable to do. Now, certainly the promises of the platform did not contemplate the downward revision of the tariff rates to such a point that any industry theretofore protected should be injured. Hence, those who contend that the promise of the platform was to reduce prices by letting in foreign competition are contending for a free trade, and not for anything that they had the right to infer from the Republican platform.
The Ways and Means Committee of the House, with Mr. Payne at its head, spent a full year in an investigation, assembling evidence in reference to the rates under the tariff, and devoted an immense amount of work in the study of the question where the tariff rates could be reduced and where they ought to be raised with a view to maintaining a reasonably protective rate, under the principles of the platform, for every industry that deserved protection. They found that the determination of the question, what was the actual cost of production and whether an industry in this country could live under a certain rate and withstand threatened competition from abroad, was most difficult. The manufacturers were prone to exaggerate the injury which a reduction in the duty would give and to magnify the amount of duty that was needed; while the importers, on the other hand, who were interested in developing the importation from foreign shores, were quite likely to be equally biased on the other side.
Mr. Payne reported a bill--the Payne Tariff bill--which went to the Senate and was amended in the Senate by increasing the duty on some things and decreasing it on others . The difference between the House bill and the Senate bill was very much less than the newspapers represented. It turns out upon examination that the reductions in the Senate were about equal to those in the House, though they differed in character. Now, there is nothing quite so difficult as the discussion of a tariff bill, for the reason that it covers so many different items, and the meaning of the terms and the percentages are very hard to understand. The passage of a new bill, especially where a change in the method of assessing the duties has been followed, presents an opportunity for various modes and calculations of the percentages of increases and decreases that are most misleading and really throw no light at all upon the changes made.
One way of stating what was done is to say what the facts show--that under the Dingley law there were 2,024 items. This included dutiable items only. The Payne law leaves 1,150 of these items unchanged. There are decreases in 654 of the items and increases in 220 of the items. Now, of course, that does not give a full picture, but it does show the proportion of decreases to have been three times those of the increases. Again, the schedules are divided into letters from A to N. The first schedule is that of chemicals, oils, etc. There are 232 items in the Dingley law; of these, 81 were decreased, 22 were increased, leaving 129 unchanged. Under Schedule B--earths, earthen ware and glass ware--there were 170 items in the Dingley law; 46 were decreased, 12 were increased, and 112 left unchanged. C is the schedule of metals and manufactures. There were 321 items in the Dingley law; 185 were decreased, 30 were increased, and 106 were left unchanged. D is the schedule of wood and manufactures of wood. There were 35 items in the Dingley law; 18 were decreased, 3 were increased, and 14 were left unchanged. There were 38 items in sugar, and of these 2 were decreased and 36 left unchanged. Schedule F covers tobacco and manufactures of tobacco, of which there were 8 items; they were all left unchanged. In the schedule covering agricultural products and provisions there were 187 items in the Dingley law; 14 of them were decreased, 19 were increased, and 154 left unchanged. Schedule H--that of spirits and wines--contained 33 items in the Dingley law; 4 were decreased, 23 increased, and 6 left unchanged. In cotton manufactures there were 261 items; of these 28 were decreased, 47 increased, and 186 left unchanged. In Schedule J--flax, hemp, and jute--there were 254 items in the Dingley law; 187 were reduced, 4 were increased, and 63 left unchanged. In wool, and manufactures thereof, there were 78 items; 3 were decreased, none were increased, and 75 left unchanged. In silk and silk goods there were 78 items; of these, 21 were decreased, 31 were increased, and 26 were left unchanged. In pulp, papers, and books there were 59 items in the Dingley law, and of these 11 were decreased, 9 were increased, and 39 left unchanged. In sundries there were 270 items, and of these 54 were decreased, 20 were increased, and 196 left unchanged. So that the total showed 2,024 items in the Dingley law, of which 654 were decreased, 220 were increased, making 874 changes, and 1,150 left unchanged.

Attempts have been made to show what the real effect of these changes has been by comparing the imports under the various schedules, and assuming that the changes and their importance were in proportion to the importations. Nothing could be more unjust in a protective tariff which also contains revenue provisions. Some of the tariff is made for the purpose of increasing the revenue by increasing importations which shall pay duty. Other items in the tariff are made for the purpose of reducing competition, that is, by reducing importations, and, therefore, the question of the importance of a change in rate can not in the slightest degree be determined by the amount of imports that take place. In order to determine the importance of the changes, it is much fairer to take the articles on which the rates of duty have been reduced and those on which the rates of duty have been increased, and then determine from statistics how large a part the articles upon which duties have been reduced play in the consumption of the country, and how large a part those upon which the duties have been increased play in the consumption of the country. Such a table has been prepared by Mr. Payne, than whom there is no one who understands better what the tariff is and who has given more attention to the details of the schedule.
It will be found that in Schedule A the increases covered only luxuries-perfumes, pomades, and like articles; Schedule H--wines and liquors--which are certainly luxuries and are made subject to increase in order to increase the revenues, amounting to $462,000,000; and in Schedule L--silks--which are luxuries, certainly, $106,000,000, making a total of the consumption of those articles upon which there was an increase and which were luxuries of $579,000,000, leaving a balance of increase on articles which were not luxuries of value in consumption of only $272,000,000. as against $5,000,000,000, representing the amount of articles entering into the consumption of the country, mostly necessities, upon which there has been a reduction of duties, and to which the 650 decreases applied.

Of the above increases the following are luxuries, being articles strictly of voluntary use:
This leaves a balance of increases which are not on articles of luxury of $298,905,752, as against decreases on about five billion dollars of consumption.
Now, this statement shows as conclusively as possible the fact that there was a substantial downward revision on articles entering into the general consumption of the country which can be termed necessities, for the proportion is $5,000,000,000, representing the consumption of articles to which decreases applied, to less than $300,000,000 of articles of necessity to which the increases applied.
Now, the promise of the Republican platform was not to revise everything downward, and in the speeches which have been taken as interpreting that platform, which I made in the campaign, I did not promise that everything should go downward. What I promised was, that there should be many decreases, and that in some few things increases would be found to be necessary; but that on the whole I conceived that the change of conditions would make the revision necessarily downward--and that, I contend, under the showing which I have made, has been the result of the Payne bill. I did not agree, nor did the Republican party agree, that we would reduce rates to such a point as to reduce prices by the introduction of foreign competition. That is what the free traders desire. That is what the revenue tariff reformers desire; but that is not what the Republican platform promised, and it is not what the Republican party wished to bring about. To repeat the statement with which I opened this speech, the proposition of the Republican party was to reduce rates so as to maintain a difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here, insuring a reasonable profit to the manufacturer on all articles produced in this country; and the proposition to reduce rates and prevent their being excessive was to avoid the opportunity for monopoly and the suppression of competition, so that the excessive rates could be taken advantage of to force prices up.
Now, it is said that there was not a reduction in a number of the schedules where there should have been. It is said that there was no reduction in the cotton schedule. There was not. The House and the Senate took evidence and found from cotton manufacturers and from other sources that the rates upon the lower class of cottons were such as to enable them to make a decent profit--but only a decent profit--and they were contented with it ; but that the rates on the higher grades of cotton cloth, by reason of court decisions, had been reduced so that they were considerably below those of the cheaper grades of cotton cloth, and that by undervaluations and otherwise the whole cotton schedule had been made unjust and the various items were disproportionate in respect to the varying cloths. Hence, in the Senate a new system was introduced attempting to make the duties more specific rather than ad valorem, in order to prevent by judicial decision or otherwise a disproportionate and unequal operation of the schedule. Under this schedule it was contended that there had been a general rise of all the duties on cotton. This was vigorously denied by the experts of the Treasury Department. At last, the Senate in conference consented to a reduction amounting to about 10 per cent. on all the lower grades of cotton and thus reduced the lower grades substantially to the same rates as before and increased the higher grades to what they ought to be under the Dingley law and what they were intended to be. Now, I am not going into the question of evidence as to whether the cotton duties were too high and whether the difference between the cost of production abroad and at home, allowing only a reasonable profit to the manufacturer here, is less than the duties which are imposed under the Payne bill. It was a question of evidence which Congress passed upon, after they heard the statements of cotton manufacturers and such other evidence as they could avail themselves of. I agree that the method of taking evidence and the determination was made in a general way, and that there ought to be other methods of obtaining evidence and reaching a conclusion more satisfactory.
Criticism has also been made of the crockery schedule and the failure to reduce that. The question whether it ought to have been reduced or not was a question of evidence which both committees of Congress took up, and both concluded that the present rates on crockery were such as were needed to maintain the business in this country. I had been informed that the crockery schedule was not high enough, and mentioned that in one of my campaign speeches as a schedule probably where there ought to be some increases. It turned out that the difficulty was rather in undervaluations than in the character of the schedule itself, and so it was not changed. It is entirely possible to collect evidence to attack almost any of the schedules, but one story is good until another is told, and I have heard no reason for sustaining the contention that the crockery schedule is unduly high. So with respect to numerous details--items of not great importance--in which, upon what they regarded as sufficient evidence, the committee advanced the rates in order to save a business which was likely to he destroyed.
I have never known a subject that will evoke so much contradictory evidence as the question of tariff rates and the question of cost of production at home and abroad. Take the subject of paper. A committee was appointed by Congress a year before the tariff sittings began, to determine what the difference was between the cost of production in Canada of print paper and the cost of production here, and they reported that they thought that a good bill would be one imposing $2 a ton on paper, rather than $6, the Dingley rate, provided that Canada could be induced to take off the export duties and remove the other obstacles to the importation of spruce wood in this country out of which wood pulp is made. An examination of the evidence satisfied Mr. Payne--I believe it satisfied some of the Republican dissenters--that $2, unless some change was made in the Canadian restrictions upon the exports of wood to this country, was much too low, and that $4 was only a fair measure of the difference between the cost of production here and in Canada. In other words, the $2 found by the special committee in the House was rather an invitation to Canada and the Canadian print-paper people to use their influence with their government to remove the wood restrictions by reducing the duty on print paper against Canadian print-paper mills. It was rather a suggestion of a diplomatic nature than a positive statement of the difference in actual cost of production under existing conditions between Canada and the United States.
There are other subjects which I might take up. The tariff on hides was taken off because it was thought that it was not necessary in view of the high price of cattle thus to protect the man who raised them, and that the duty imposed was likely to throw the control of the sale of hides into the hands of the meat packers in Chicago. In order to balance the reduction on hides, however, there was a great reduction in shoes, from 25 to 10 per cent.; on sole leather, from 20 to 5 per cent.; on harness, from 45 to 20 per cent. So there was a reduction in the duty on coal of 33 1/3 per cent. All countervailing duties were removed from oil, naphtha, gasoline, and its refined products. Lumber was reduced from $2 to $1.25; and these all on articles of prime necessity. It is said that there might have been more. But there were many business interests in the South, in Maine, along the border, and especially in the far Northwest, which insisted that it would give great advantage to Canadian lumber if the reduction were made more than 75 cents. Mr. Pinchot, the Chief Forester, thought that it would tend to make better lumber in this country if a duty were retained on it. The lumber interests thought that $2 was none too much, but the reduction was made and the compromise effected. Personally I was in favor of free lumber, because I did not think that if the tariff was taken off there would be much suffering among the lumber interests. But in the controversy the House and Senate took a middle course, and who can say they were not justified.
With respect to the wool schedule, I agree that it probably represents considerably more than the difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here. The difficulty about the woolen schedule is that there were two contending factions early in the history of Republican tariffs, to wit, woolgrowers and the woolen manufacturers, and that finally, many years ago, they settled on a basis by which wool in the grease should have 11 cents a pound, and by which allowance should be made for the shrinkage of the washed wool in the differential upon woolen manufactures. The percentage of duty was very heavy--quite beyond the difference in the cost of production, which was not then regarded as a necessary or proper limitation upon protective duties.
When it came to the question of reducing the duty at this bearing in the tariff bill on wool, Mr. Payne, in the House, and Mr. Aldrich, in the Senate, although both favored reduction in the schedule, found that in the Republican party the interests of the woolgrowers of the Far West and the interests of the woolen manufacturers in the East and in other States, reflected through their representatives in Congress, was sufficiently strong to defeat any attempt to change the woolen tariff, and that had it been attempted it would have beaten the bill reported from either committee. I am sorry this is so, and I could wish that it had been otherwise. It is the one important defect in the present Payne tariff bill and in the performance of the promise of the platform to reduce rates to a difference in the cost of production, with reasonable profit to the manufacturer. That it will increase the price of woolen cloth or clothes, I very much doubt. There have been increases by the natural product, but this was not due to the tariff, because the tariff was not changed. The increase would, therefore, have taken place whether the tariff would have been changed or not. The cost of woolen cloths behind the tariff wall, through the effect of competition, has been greatly less than the duty, if added to the price, would have made it.
There is a complaint now by the woolen clothiers and by the carded woolen people of this woolen schedule. They have honored me by asking in circulars sent out by them that certain questions be put to me in respect to it, and asking why I did not veto the bill in view of the fact that the woolen schedule was not made in accord with the platform. I ought to say in respect to this point that all of them in previous tariff bills were strictly in favor of maintaining the woolen schedule as it was. The carded woolen people are finding that carded wools are losing their sales because they are going out of style. People prefer worsteds. The clothing people who are doing so much circularizing were contented to let the woolen schedule remain as it was until very late in the tariff discussion, long after the bill had passed the House, and, indeed, they did not grow very urgent until the bill had passed the Senate. This was because they found that the price of woolen cloth was going up, and so they desired to secure reduction in the tariff which would enable them to get cheaper material. They themselves are protected by a large duty, and I can not with deference to them ascribe their intense interest only to a deep sympathy with the ultimate consumers, so-called. But, as I have already said, I am quite willing to admit that allowing the woolen schedule to remain where it is, is not a compliance with the terms of the platform as I interpret it and as it is generally understood.
On the whole, however, I am bound to say that I think the Payne tariff bill is the best tariff bill that the Republican party ever passed; that in it the party has conceded the necessity for following the changed conditions and reducing tariff rates accordingly. This is a substantial achievement in the direction of lower tariffs and downward revision, and it ought to be accepted as such. Critics of the bill utterly ignore the very tremendous cuts that have been made in the iron schedule, which heretofore has been subject to criticism in all tariff bills. From iron ore, which was cut 75 per cent., to all the other items as low as 20 per cent., with an average of something like 40 or 50 per cent., that schedule has been reduced so that the danger of increasing prices through a monopoly of the business is very much lessened, and that was the chief purpose of revising the tariff downward under Republican protective principles. The severe critics of the bill pass this reduction in the metal schedule with a sneer, and say that the cut did not hurt the iron interests of the country. Well, of course it did not hurt them. It was not expected to hurt them. It was expected only to reduce excessive rates, so that business should still be conducted at a profit, and the very character of the criticism is an indication of the general injustice of the attitude of those who make it, in assuming that it was the promise of the Republican party to hurt the industries of the country by the reductions which they were to make in the tariff, whereas it expressly indicated as plainly as possible in the platform that all of the industries were to be protected against injury by foreign competition, and the promise only went to the reduction of excessive rates beyond what was necessary to protect them.
The high cost of living, of which 50 per cent. is consumed in food, 25 per cent. in clothing, and 25 per cent. in rent and fuel, has not been produced by the tariff, because the tariff has remained the same while the increases have gone on. It is due to the change of conditions the world over. Living has increased everywhere in cost--in countries where there is free trade and in countries where there is protection--and that increase has been chiefly seen in the cost of food products. In other words we have had to pay more for the products of the farmer, for meat, for grain, for everything that enters into food. Now, certainly no one will contend that protection has increased the cost of food in this country, when the fact is that we have been the greatest exporters of food products in the world. It is only that the demand has increased beyond the supply, that farm lands have not been opened as rapidly as the population, and the demand has increased. I am not saying that the tariff does not increase prices in clothing and in building and in other items that enter into the necessities of life, but what I wish to emphasize is that the recent increases in the cost of living in this country have not been due to the tariff. We have a much higher standard of living in this country than they have abroad, and this has been made possible by higher income for the workingman, the farmer, and all classes. Higher wages have been made possible by the encouragement of diversified industries, built up and fostered by the tariff.
Now, the revision downward of the tariff that I have favored will not, I hope, destroy the industries of the country. Certainly it is not intended to. All that it is intended to do, and that is what I wish to repeat, is to put the tariff where it will protect industries here from foreign competition, but will not enable those who will wish to monopolize to raise prices by taking advantage of excessive rates beyond the normal difference in the cost of production.
If the country desires free trade, and the country desires a revenue tariff and wishes the manufacturers all over the country to go out of business, and to have cheaper prices at the expense of the sacrifice of many of our manufacturing interests, then it ought to say so and ought to put the Democratic party in power if it thinks that party can be trusted to carry out any affirmative policy in favor of a revenue tariff. Certainly in the discussions in the Senate there was no great manifestation on the part of our Democratic friends in favor of reducing rates on necessities. They voted to maintain the tariff rates on everything that came from their particular sections. If we are to have free trade, certainly it can not be had through the maintenance of Republican majorities in the Senate and House and a Republican administration.
And now the question arises, what was the duty of a Member of Congress who believed in a downward revision greater than that which has been accomplished, who thought that the wool schedules ought to be reduced, and that perhaps there were other respects in which the bill could be improved? Was it his duty because, in his judgment, it did not fully and completely comply with the promises of the party platform as he interpreted it, and indeed as I had interpreted it, to vote against the bill? I am here to justify those who answer this question in the negative. Mr. Tawney was adownward revisionist like myself. He is a low-tariff man, and has been known to be such in Congress all the time he has been there. He is a prominent Republican, the head of the Appropriations Committee, and when a man votes as I think he ought to vote, and an opportunity such as this presents itself, I am glad to speak in behalf of what he did, not in defense of it, but in support of it.
This is a government by a majority of the people. It is a representative government. People select some 400 members to constitute the lower House and some 92 members to constitute the upper House through their legislatures, and the varying views of a majority of the voters in eighty or ninety millions of people are reduced to one resultant force to take affirmative steps in carrying on a government by a system of parties. Without parties popular government would be absolutely impossible. In a party, those who join it, if they would make it effective, must surrender their personal predilections on matters comparatively of less importance in order to accomplish the good which united action on the most important principles at issue secures.
Now, I am not here to criticise those Republican Members and Senators whose views on the subject of the tariff were so strong and intense that they believed it their duty to vote against their party on the tariff bill. It is a question for each man to settle for himself. The question is whether he shall help maintain the party solidarity for accomplishing its chief purposes, or whether the departure from principle in the bill as he regards it is so extreme that he must in conscience abandon the party. All I have to say is, in respect to Mr. Tawney's action, and in respect to my own in signing the bill, that I believed that the interests of the country, the interests of the party, required me to sacrifice the accomplishment of certain things in the revision of the tariff which I had hoped for, in order to maintain party solidarity, which I believe to be much more important than the reduction of rates in one or two schedules of the tariff. Had Mr. Tawney voted against the bill, and there had been others of the House sufficient in number to have defeated the bill, or if I had vetoed the bill because of the absence of a reduction of rates in the wool schedule, when there was a general downward revision, and a substantial one though not a complete one, we should have left the party in a condition of demoralization that would have prevented the accomplishment of purposes and a fulfillment of other promises which we had made just as solemnly as we had entered into that with respect to the tariff. When I could say without hesitation that this is the best tariff bill that the Republican party has ever passed, and therefore the best tariff bill that has been passed at all, I do not feel that I could have reconciled any other course to my conscience than that of signing the bill, and I think Mr. Tawney feels the same way. Of course, if I had vetoed the bill I would have received the applause of many Republicans who may be called low-tariff Republicans, and who think deeply on that subject, and of all the Democracy. Our friends the Democrats would have applauded, and then laughed in their sleeve at the condition in which the party would have been left; but, more than this, and waiving considerations of party, where would the country have been had the bill been vetoed, or been lost by a vote? It would have left the question of the revision of the tariff open for further discussion during the next session. It would have suspended the settlement of all our business down to a known basis upon which prosperity could proceed and investments be made, and it would have held up the coming of prosperity to this country certainly for a year and probably longer. These are the reasons why I signed it.
But there are additional reasons why the bill ought not to have been beaten. It contained provisions of the utmost importance in the interest of this country in dealing with foreign countries and in the supplying of a deficit which under the Dingley bill seemed inevitable. There has been a disposition in some foreign countries taking advantage of greater elasticity in their systems of imposing tariffs and of making regulations to exclude our products and exercise against us undue discrimination. Against these things we have been helpless, because it required an act of Congress to meet the difficulties. It is now proposed by what is called the maximum and minimum clause, to enable the President to allow to come into operation a maximum or penalizing increase of duties over the normal or minimum duties whenever in his opinion the conduct of the foreign countries has been unduly discriminatory against the United States. It is hoped that very little use may be required of this clause, but its presence in the law and the power conferred upon the Executive, it is thought, will prevent in the future such undue discriminations. Certainly this is most important to our exporters of agricultural products and manufactures.
Second. We have imposed an excise tax upon corporations measured by 1 per cent. upon the net income of all corporations except fraternal and charitable corporations after exempting $5,000. This, it is thought, will raise an income of 26 to 30 millions of dollars, will supply the deficit which otherwise might arise without it, and will bring under federal supervision more or less all the corporations of the country. The inquisitorial provisions of the act are mild but effective, and certainly we may look not only for a revenue but for some most interesting statistics and the means of obtaining supervision over corporate methods that has heretofore not obtained.
Then, we have finally done justice to the Philippines. We have introduced free trade between the Philippines and the United States, and we have limited the amount of sugar and the amount of tobacco and cigars that can be introduced from the Philippines to such a figure as shall greatly profit the Philippines and yet in no way disturb the products of the United States or interfere with those engaged in the tobacco or sugar interests here. These features of the bill were most important, and the question was whether they were to be sacrificed because the bill did not in respect to wool and woolens and in some few other matters meet our expectations. I do not hesitate to repeat that I think it would have been an unwise sacrifice of the business interests of the country, it would have been an unwise sacrifice of the solidarity, efficiency, and promise-performing power of the party, to have projected into the next session another long discussion of the tariff, and to have delayed or probably defeated the legislation needed in the improvement of our interstate commerce regulation, and in making more efficient our antitrust law and the prosecutions under it. Such legislation is needed to clinch the Roosevelt policies, by which corporations and those in control of them shall be limited to a lawful path and shall be prevented from returning to those abuses which a recurrence of prosperity is too apt to bring about unless definite, positive steps of a legislative character are taken to mark the lines of honest and lawful corporate management.
Now, there is another provision in the new tariff bill that I regard as of the utmost importance. It is a provision which appropriates $75,000 for the President to employ persons to assist him in the execution of the maximum and minimum tariff clause and in the administration of the tariff law. Under that authority, I conceive that the President has the right to appoint a board, as I have appointed it, who shall associate with themselves, and have under their control, a number of experts who shall address themselves, first, to the operation of foreign tariffs upon the exports of the United States, and then to the operation of the United States tariff upon imports and exports. There are provisions in the general tariff procedure for the ascertainment of the cost of production of articles abroad and the cost of production of articles here. I intend to direct the board in the course of these duties and in carrying them out, in order to assist me in the administration of the law, to make what might be called a glossary of the tariff, or a small encyclopedia of the tariff, or something to be compared to the United States Pharmacopoeia with reference to information as to drugs and medicines. I conceive that such a board may very properly, in the course of their duties, take up separately all the items of the tariff, both those on the free list and those which are dutiable, describe what they are, where they are manufactured, what their uses are, the methods of manufacture, the cost of production abroad and here, and every other fact with respect to each item which would enable the Executive to understand the operation of the tariff, the value of the article, and the amount of duty imposed, and all those details which the student of every tariff law finds it so difficult to discover. I do not intend, unless compelled or directed by Congress, to publish the result of these investigations, but to treat them merely as incidental facts brought out officially from time to time, and as they may be ascertained and put on record in the department, there to be used when they have all been accumulated and are sufficiently complete to justify executive recommendation based on them. Now, I think it is utterly useless, as I think it would be greatly distressing to business, to talk of another revision of the tariff during the present Congress. I should think that it would certainly take the rest of this administration to accumulate the data upon which a new and proper revision of the tariff might be had. By that time the whole Republican party can express itself again in respect to the matter and bring to bear upon its Representatives in Congress that sort of public opinion which shall result in solid party action. I am glad to see that a number of those who thought it their duty to vote against the bill insist that they are still Republicans and intend to carry on their battle in favor of lower duties and a lower revision within the lines of the party. That is their right and, in their view of things, is their duty.
It is vastly better that they should seek action of the party than that they should break off from it and seek to organize another party, which would probably not result in accomplishing anything more than merely defeating our party and inviting in the opposing party, which does not believe, or says that it does not believe, in protection. I think that we ought to give the present bill a chance. After it has been operating for two or three years, we can tell much more accurately than we can to-day its effect upon the industries of the country and the necessity for any amendment in its provisions.
I have tried to state as strongly as I can, but not more strongly than I think the facts justify, the importance of not disturbing the business interests of this country by an attempt in this Congress or the next to make a new revision; but meantime I intend, so far as in me lies, to secure official data upon the operation of the tariff, from which, when a new revision is attempted, exact facts can be secured.
I have appointed a tariff board that has no brief for either side in respect to what the rates shall be. I hope they will make their observations and note their data in their record with exactly the same impartiality and freedom from anxiety as to result with which the Weather Bureau records the action of the elements or any scientific bureau of the Government records the results of its impartial investigations. Certainly the experience in this tariff justifies the statement that no revision should hereafter be attempted in which more satisfactory evidence of an impartial character is not secured.
I am sorry that I am not able to go into further detail with respect to the tariff bill, but I have neither the information nor the time in which to do it. I have simply stated the case as it seemed to Mr. Tawney in his vote and as it seemed to me in my signing the bill.

Damian Hinds,United Kingdom,2019-06-21,"It’s great to be here at Wellington College and also to be the warm-up act for Amanda, our HMCT. I want to thank you Amanda for the important work that you and Ofsted do. For your personal commitment to educational rigour.
I know you’ve already heard from some excellent speakers today and that this festival is always a fantastic opportunity to debate the big ideas when it comes to education.
It’s a privilege to be surrounded by those who share a passion for this subject. Events like this are essential in bring together the big thinkers in our education system.
At times like this, with so much uncertainty in the air it’s important that we all take the time to reflect on where we are going.
By its nature, education is about the long term. At its heart, the work that all of you do is about shaping the minds of the next generation. A great education is fundamental to success – the individual success of all those who study, whatever their age and success for our country.
A great education system can, and should, be geared towards tackling the big, long term challenges our country faces.
One of these great, generational challenges is productivity. It’s not an abstract concept. We should care about productivity because it decides not just the size of our economy but our quality of life. Higher productivity means more fulfilling, higher paying jobs. It means new investment, leading to greater prosperity.
Productivity matters because it’s about people being able to fulfil their potential. Economically, we can’t afford to waste the talents of young people held back by the circumstances of their birth. This is why social mobility has always been critical to my vision for education and inseparable from the goal of raising productivity.
But when it comes to productivity, we lag behind. Badly. Our key competitors such as Germany, France and the US – all produce over 25% more per hour than the UK. This didn’t happen overnight. The productivity gap with our European competitors opened up in late 1960s, and earlier still the US.
Just as the gap has been around for some time, the gap won’t be closed unless we take the long term view. To fix Britain’s productivity we need a major upgrade in the nation’s skills. That should start with an honest assessment of where we are.
Across the UK as a whole we have a large number of people who either never progressed beyond GCSEs or gained low level vocational qualifications. When you consider that the equivalent in Germany is 87%, its clear we have our work cut out.
The answer lies in our schools and our colleges. As part of the review of the national curriculum which began in 2011, we benchmarked our curriculum against those of high performing jurisdictions and found that they set higher expectations without compromising curriculum breadth.
We reformed the national curriculum in 2014, and then GCSEs qualifications, so that we set world-class standards across all subjects. We’ve removed hundreds of pointless and unproductive qualifications.
When you look at how productivity differs between places in the UK, the picture is stark.
According to the CBI the most productive area of the country is almost three times more productive than the least. Educational attainment is the single most important driver of those differences.
Of course the gap between Britain and Germany, or between one region of the UK and another, isn’t a reflection of the innate talents of our young people.
Instead it’s a challenge to us all to ensure that our system is delivering the opportunities for education and training across the whole country.
We have made progress. The industrial strategy sets out a plan to invest in the three engines of productivity – individuals, innovation and infrastructure. Through our Opportunity Areas programme we’re investing £72m in some of the places with the biggest challenges, to make sure our efforts are focused on eliminating the productivity gap between different parts of the country.
In order to transform Britain’s productivity and set our young people up for the future, the goal of building a world class education system drives everything we aim to do at the DfE.
This is why we’ve focused on school autonomy and trusted leaders to run their schools, because that’s how you raise standards
It’s why we’ve focused on teacher retention. This includes our Recruitment and Retention Strategy. This provides a commitment to develop world class training and development together with strong career pathways.
It’s why we are committed to reducing the workload of teachers and supporting school leaders to create the right culture in their schools.
We know that more schools are taking action to tackle workload. We have seen over 150,000 collective downloads of our workload reduction toolkit in less than 18 months.
We are working with Ofsted to simplify the accountability system. The new Ofsted framework will have an active focus on reducing teacher workload.
An education system can only ever be as good as its teachers and its leaders. We are very lucky to have some of the very best. They, indeed you, are the fulcrum of the system
We have been rigorous about the curriculum so that young people are prepared for adult life; reforming GCSEs and introducing the EBacc. We will continue to pursue the manifesto target of 75% EBacc entry at GCSEs.
These are subjects which form part of the compulsory curriculum in many of the highest performing countries internationally, at least up to 15 or 16.
We have focused relentlessly on social mobility and disadvantage. Narrowing the gap between children from well off families and their less well-off peers so that every young person has the opportunity to make the most of their talents.
We have made progress. I could stand in front of you and reel off more statistics on how far we’ve come. But I want, instead, to talk about where I think we need to go from here. Not in the short term but the long term, so we can confidently continue to build the world class education system our country needs.
To do that we must be ambitious for the future of our schools and colleges, not just for the next year but for the next generation.
That requires a vision for how we continue to raise school standards. How we ensure that we have the very best teachers for our children and how we will fix technical education. We owe it to the next generation to confront the big choices, not to duck them.
Yes it’s true that we live in a time of uncertainty, at home and abroad, but that uncertainty makes it more urgent, not less.
I want to reassert our long-term vision for an education system that achieves these goals, and the challenges we must overcome in order to get there.
Part of the reason we’ve made such progress since 2010 is that we know what works: school autonomy, great teachers, and a rigorous curriculum.
That is why we want to see us finishing the reforms we began in 2010. That means continuing to be ambitious about academisation by growing the best trusts, where teachers and leaders are already making an extraordinary difference to the lives of children. We must do that in the parts of the country where the need for those teachers and leaders is greatest.
Our ambition remains for all schools to be academies, working in partnerships in great school trusts. This year we hit the milestone of 50% of pupils taught in academies.
Looking to the long term; 10 years from now, we want to see the vast majority of schools becoming academies and joining strong academy chains.
To achieve this we will build on the experience of previous capacity funds for academy trusts. We will shortly be announcing a fund that will boost the growth of our strongest academy trusts allowing them to support a greater number of schools across the country.
The fund will increase the capacity of academy trusts to grow partnerships that support the development of teachers and leaders and the education of children. We have learnt from earlier growth funds what works best and we intend to build on this.
The fund will support smaller school trusts that wish to merge into existing or new academy groups, and providing high-potential academy trusts with funding to meet the challenges they face as they grow.
Local authorities have an important role to play and we are committed to working with them to consider how this will evolve as we move towards the vast majority of schools becoming academies.
This will include exploring how they might support the growth of academy trusts in their areas. As we think about the future, we must take a long-term view of how to attract more high calibre teachers into the profession.
We won’t get the teachers we need unless we focus on creating the right conditions for them to excel. There is clearly a strong case to explore reform of teacher pay to ensure that the money schools spend on pay is targeted where it will have the biggest impact on recruitment and retention.
We must be bold about the offer that we make to new teachers. We recently announced the Early Career Framework – in itself the most significant reform to teaching since it became a graduate profession.
We will build on this by introducing a new, rigorous core content framework for Initial Teacher Training to align with the Early Career Framework.
Taken together, this will create an entitlement for new teachers to 3 years of structured training and development, backed by the best available research.
In doing so we aim to ensure that people enter teaching in a manner that reflects its position as one of the most important professions in our society.
Alongside this we will deliver the other commitments in the Recruitment and Retention strategy, including the expansion of flexible working and more diverse career pathways.
We know that our economy has evolved in its ability to accommodate flexible working and we need to help the schools system do more to support teachers who want this.
We must be relentless in ensuring that our reforms are always improving the odds for young people. Where you end up in life shouldn’t be determined by where you start, and yet many disadvantaged young people lose out by not having a parent or guardian who is ‘in the know’ about what to study.
Central to a world class system in the long term is ensuring that children are setting themselves up for success with their subject choices, which is why EBacc is so important.
Participation in creative subjects such as music and the arts is vital, particularly up to Key Stage 3. The DfE is committed to supporting both participation and progression – most notably in music.
Schools previously entered many more pupils in these subjects. By 2011, however, the proportion of pupils entering science, a foreign language and geography GCSEs had fallen to less than a quarter.
These subjects are essential if young people are to succeed in the knowledge economy, particularly if they are considering a good university. They are also at the heart of a well-rounded education.
Since our reforms began in 2010 we have seen entry levels for science increase dramatically from 63% in 2010 to 95% in 2018.
The proportion of those taking history or geography has increased from 48% to 78%. The proportion of pupils taking the EBacc combination of subjects as a whole increased to 38% in 2018. But we need to go much further.
In particular, we want to focus on languages. While we have seen a rise in the number of pupils taking at least one language from 40% in 2010 to 46%, there remains much more to do.
It is vital that children should be given the opportunity to learn languages to prepare them for a world that is more connected than ever.
As part of a long term approach to education we will keep up the focus on language curriculum programmes and continue to recruit and train more MFL teachers.
We would like to work with schools to do more to strengthen opportunities for more children to learn a foreign language.
Our Free School programme has led the way in deploying a rigorous knowledge rich curriculum with over 400 now open and many more in the pipeline.
We all know that digital skills will be become increasingly critical, whatever career path a young person chooses. That is why we reformed the computer science GCSE, with input from leading industry experts, to equip pupils with the knowledge and skills they will need for the high-tech jobs of the future.
Computer science will become an essential skill in the digital era and already leads to a wide range of careers. We want to see more pupils, including girls, follow this path.
To deliver on these promises, schools and colleges need to have the resources to support the development of healthy, happy children.
From my conversations with heads and colleges principals – I have heard first-hand about the pressures you face.
You will have heard the Secretary of State promise that he would back teachers to have the resources they need and would make the strongest possible case for investment in our schools and colleges. The Secretary of State has asked me to make that commitment to you again today.
It must be right that in a world class education system, there can be no people or places left behind. We must look again at how we can be bolder in supporting the schools facing some of the greatest challenges, in our plans to help schools tackle behaviour and attendance and for the future of our successful Opportunity Areas programme.
As the Secretary of State set out in his speech on Monday, in all our reforms we must bring to bear a new focus on Children in Need and recognise the changing face of disadvantage.
Alongside this, we must find ways to work with heads and principals to support schools in making every pound count in the classroom.
There are many lessons to take from the 2016 referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. But a clear lesson is that we must turn our attention to making all parts of the country engines of productivity and places where there are plenty of high quality, well paid jobs.
The most productive parts of the country benefit from a virtuous circle, where strong schools with great teachers lead to strong skills with investment following behind as the skilled workforce is in place.
That is why – to create that virtuous circle everywhere – we want to do more to incentivise the best teachers and leaders to work in parts of the country and the schools where they are most needed. We want the best Trusts to expand into areas that some would describe as being “left behind”.
But we have no chance of providing the next generation with the skills to succeed if we do not get serious about investing in technical education.
Which is why we will continue to pursue the reforms of technical education, including the delivery of T-levels and the NRS, which have already been announced.
Colleges are the critical infrastructure of the Industrial Strategy. Last month the Prime Minister was right to say that we have fallen behind our competitor nations when it comes to technical education as successive government have failed to give FE colleges the support they need.
The Post 18 review argued compellingly for much greater investment in further education – both talented teachers and the essential infrastructure, such as buildings and equipment, that underpins the sector. Working in partnership
We are clear on where we want the schools system to go, but we plan to listen to your advice on how to get there.
We want to work with teachers, governors and school and college leaders to turn this vision into reality, just as we worked with you to produce our teacher R&amp;R strategy
Now is the time to think big, not small. Long-term not short term. To ensure that we can fix the generational challenge of productivity and that our world class education system continues to improve and be available to all children.
",2019 Speech at Wellington College,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/damian-hinds-2019-speech-at-wellington-college/
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-08-27,"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests, please. I stand before you tonight honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years and blooming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years.
We begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago.
And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. And congratulations, thank you for that great job out there. We really appreciate it. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love, and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy.
For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent first lady. Thank you sweetheart. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children. Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you. And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother, and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert.
Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values, a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our vice president, Mike Pence. And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you, Karen.
My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
In the new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach four new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country.
Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the people’s house, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story.
This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like President Grant and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to chart our continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument and asked God and his Providence to save our nation. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on course to victory in the Second World War.
In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner. We will defeat the virus and the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before.
What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America’s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country is blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny, and communism.
This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and has lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country.
Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide if we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has been foolishly done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists, and agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. That won’t happen. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a simple question, how can the Democratic Party ask to lead our country when it spent so much time tearing down our country?
In the Left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on Earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we do not turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in almighty God.
Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul. He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of America’s greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs, and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain, and then he flew back to Washington, and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended.
Four years ago, I ran for president because I cannot watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do. Thank you.
From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class, and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You have seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, “America first.” Thank you. Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, ended the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American energy independence.
We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest-hitting action against China in American history by far.
They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA, but again they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new Mexico-US-Canada agreement into law. And right now, auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries.
In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down, and today America’s borders are more secure than ever before. Thank you. We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20000 gang members and 500000 criminal aliens. We have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.
We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union, representing our country’s courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people. You see, this country loves our law enforcement. They do. They really do. Love and respect.
When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the chairman of the board. And now those talented American workers have been rehired, and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot. Please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been through a lot. Thank you very much.
Last month, I took on big pharma. You think that’s easy? It’s not. And signed orders that would massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures. We passed the decades-long-awaited right to try. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice, our great veterans, we’re taking care of our veterans. 91% approval rating this month, the VA given by our veterans. First time anything like that has ever happened.
By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court justices.
And to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and long-term funding of historically Black colleges and universities. And before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. And I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. And I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. And when I am re-elected, the best is yet to come.
Thank you very much.
When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel’s true capital, and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned, existing building in a better location. Real estate deal, right? And opened it at a cost of less than $500000. Many things like that the government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. Thank you to the UAE. Thank you to Israel. In addition, we obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, and killed its founder and leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number-one terrorist by far, Qassim Suleimani.
Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America out of new wars, and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States Military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.
We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states. They did not want to hear Biden’s hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back.
As vice president, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I’ve reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission that took out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Suleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That is why China supports Joe Biden, and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information.
China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude.
Many Americans, including me, I have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary. In their honor, we unite. In their memory, we will overcome it. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, invoking the Defense Production Act. We produce the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. Good job heading the task force by our great vice president. Thank you very much, Mike. Please stand up.
We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves, and gowns to our frontline health care workers. To protect our nation’s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes. We gave everything you can possibly give, and we’re still giving it because we are taking care of our senior citizens. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined, think of that. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that? On Sunday night when we announced it. That will save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rates. And you look at it, and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80% since April. 80%.
The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don’t hear that. They do not write about that. They don’t want to write about that. They do not want you to know those things. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that.
We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That’s one of the reasons that we’re advancing so rapidly with our economy. Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over nine million jobs, and that’s a record in the history of our country.
Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe called it hysterical and xenophobic. And then I introduced a ban on Europe, very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation’s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds. The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss, and much more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it’s a surrender to the virus.
My administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts, and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. And we want to see so many of those great states be opened by Democrats. We want them to be open. They have to be open. They have to get back to work. They have to get back to work, and they have to get back to school.
Most importantly, we are marshaling America’s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. Nobody thought it could be done this fast. Normally it would be years, and we did it in a matter of a few months. We are producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus.
At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that is not because they don’t have one. It is because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light. But when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. He doesn’t have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which would totally collapse our rapidly improving economy, and once again record stock markets that we have right now, will also collapse.
On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads. I will not raise taxes, I will cut them, and very substantially. And we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China, back to America. And we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing for quite some time if you’ve noticed. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA.
Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas, laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, destroying those states, absolutely destroying those states and others. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. Everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody’s seen anything like it, but we saw it last week in California. How can Joe Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can’t even keep the lights on?
Joe Biden’s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform. You can’t get away from this, co-authored with far-left senator, crazy Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie manifesto[ calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch-and-release, and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer. Come over to our country, everybody has a lawyer. We have a lawyer for you. That’s all we need, is more lawyers.
Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage, and promised he was going to give it away your health care dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring massive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all the goodies that they want to give. Education, health care, everything. He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the manifesto. The Biden plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic. And he is even talking about taking the wall down. How about that?
Biden also vowed to oppose school choice, and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term, I will expand charter schools, and provide school choice to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. Great people. Great, great people.
Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies, right up until the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul. Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.
During the Democrat convention, the words, under God, were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance. Not once, but twice. We will never do that. But the fact is, this is where they’re coming from. Like it or not, this is where they’re coming from. If the Left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there are many. We see them all the time. It is incredible, actually. Then how is he ever going to stand up for you? He’s not.
The most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department, “A cancer that is rotten to the root,” Biden would not disavow her support and reject her endorsement. He proudly displayed it shortly later on his website, displayed it in big letters.
Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the Radical Left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.
One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American heroes called the NYPD, or New York’s finest, who I was very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. If they were allowed to do their job, you’d have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy. Three years ago on the Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight, and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids.
Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children, and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss. And we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that’s the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous, and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs. And by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you. And those who suffer most are the great people who they protect, and who they want to protect at an even higher level. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule.
In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all, like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York, and many others, Democrat-run. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. Just call, we’re ready to go in. We will take care of your problem in a matter of hours. Just call. We have to wait for the call. It is too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside, I signed an order immediately, 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle. It all stopped. No more statues. They said, “That’s just too long,” as they looked at a statue. “I think we’ll rip it down.” Then they said, “10 years in prison? I think that is too long. Let’s go home.”
During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they are starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. It is too late, Joe. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bailout vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail.
Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain, David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protesters. They call them peaceful protesters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members, Brian and Kielen. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain. David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Great man.
As long as I am president, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that is up to them. But I as your president, will not be part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.
Last year, over 1000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victim and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the Left ignore these American victims. I never will. If the radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every town, city, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US government. Just think of that.
Liberal politician’s claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who exactly is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by Radical Left. Always remember, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. That is what is happening. And it has been going on from before I even got elected. And remember this, they spied on my campaign, and they got caught. Let’s see now what happens.
We must reclaim our independence from the Left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted, trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of Cancel Culture is to make Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true. Very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget.
Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing from the scene of the wreckage. The same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children into the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled off compounds and communities and the best neighborhoods in the world. They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is, I am here.
What is the name of that building? But I’ll say it differently, the fact is, we are here and they are not. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world is not a building, it is a home, as far as I am concerned. It’s not even a house, it is a home. It’s a wonderful place with an incredible history. But it is all because of you. Together, we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains. And we will end our resilience for banned things. We will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We are taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home.
We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months. And it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities, and ensure federal health care is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens.
We will have strong borders. And I’ve said for years, without borders, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don’t win, your Second Amendment doesn’t have a chance. I can tell you that. I have totally protected it.
We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. They are coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number-one in the world, and keep America energy independent. And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is. You haven’t seen that in a long time.
We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect. We will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in, if they do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it is amazing how open they have been lately.
We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars. This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight, I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now.
Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Our country wasn’t built by Cancel Culture, speech codes, and crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American patriots. We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers, and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down, held back, or in any way reigned in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on Earth.
I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money. They didn’t have fame. But they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers. They pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier. Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon, they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were.
Americans build their future, we don’t tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are.
Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets, and bayonets to rescue American liberty. They had no fear. But America did not stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a six-million-pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible.
Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights, and we will show that the world for America there is a dream, and it is not beyond your reach. Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America.
On November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before. I am very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party.
I love you all. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-09-28,"What's going on now is the single greatest scam in the history of American politics. The Democrats want to take away your guns. They want to take away your healthcare. They want to take away your vote. They want to take away your freedom. They want to take away your judges. They want to take away everything.
We can never let this happen. We're fighting to drain the swamp, and that's exactly what I'm doing, and you see why we have to do it, because our country is at stake like never before.
It's all very simple: they're trying to stop me, because I'm fighting for you, and I'll never let that happen.
",Donald Trump Vlog: Fighting for You,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-vlog-fighting-for-you-september-28-2019
Nick Clegg,United Kingdom,2016-02-03,"Today I want to talk about the UK as an open, confident society. It is by being confident – confident in ourselves, in our communities, and in our values – that we can remain an open, liberal nation.
I am pleased to be delivering this speech in Luton. Luton has had to endure being associated in the national consciousness with some very grim imagery indeed. The ugly public posturing of Al Muhajiroun and the English Defence League. Memories of the train station where the 7/7 bombers boarded a train for London, before detonating horror in our capital.
But I hope today to draw attention to a different Luton; Luton as the home of some of the most vibrant campaigns against racism, extremism and Islamophobia.
In particular I would like to thank the members of the Luton Commission on Community Cohesion, which is a superb example of the way in which a community can work together. The town has remained true to its original vision of ‘sticking together’, working across age, religious and ethnic boundaries to promote a tolerant, strong, vibrant community. That is why I think Luton is the perfect place to set out my vision for an open, confident Britain.
It is quite clear that this vision faces serious challenges. Most obviously, the grave threat of home-grown terrorism. One of the most important tasks for the Coalition Government is to guard against this danger. But we also face the potential rise of racist groups like the BNP – not only on the streets but in our democratic system too. The Prime Minister has recently argued that we need to assert confidently our liberal values. I agree. Politicians have a huge responsibility to lead by example, and engage in the often difficult arguments around immigration, multiculturalism and liberty. That is why I think the PM was absolutely right to make his argument for ‘muscular liberalism’.
I also think the Prime Minister was right to make a sharp distinction between religious belief and political ideology. Religious devotion is completely separate from violent extremism. The overwhelming majority of devout people of all faiths reject violence and terrorism. There is some evidence that those Muslims who do turn to violence have a shallower understanding of Islam than Muslims who may have radical views, but reject violence.
The enemies of liberty are those people who have closed their minds, closed off the possibility that there may be other valid ways to live, other than their own. They believe they have discovered the prescription for how to live – which everyone should follow. Closed minds can lead to closed communities, to extremism, and in some cases to violence.
There are nationalistic or racist extremists, like the members of the English Defence League, or the BNP. There are black extremists like the Nation of Islam. There are Muslim extremists like the members of Islam 4 UK. Very often these groups have a symbiotic relationship with each other, maintained by the media: extremist Muslim groups giving birth to extremist white hate groups, and vice versa.
My point is this. We need a perfect symmetry in our response to crime and violent extremism. Bigots are bigots, whatever the colour of their skin. Criminals are criminals, whatever their political beliefs. Terrorists are terrorists, whatever their religion.
This means that those of us who want to live in a liberal society must confront hateful views and practices regardless of who expresses them. The Government is committed to tackling hate crimes against any group – gay people, Jews, women, black people or Muslims.
Let me say something here about the specific issue of Islam and violent extremism. There is a corrosive tendency, not least in some parts of the media, to confuse the tenets of Islam with the actions of terrorists.
As my colleague in the Coalition Government, Sayeeda Warsi has argued: ‘a worrying argument that forms the basis for justifying Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hatred is the idea that Islam is a particularly violent creed.”
The core liberal values – freedom of speech and worship, democracy, the rule of law, and equal rights regardless of sex, race and sexuality – are as compatible with Islam as with any other religion.
It is better to be a citizen of present-day Turkey – a Muslim majority country – than in one of the Communist-era countries that crushed both these values and religious life in equal measure.
Of course, there are issues that many Muslims in this country feel strongly about: issues like Palestine, Iraq, Kashmir and Guantanamo Bay. I understand these concerns. And the Government takes them very seriously indeed.
But let us be absolutely clear. No matter what criticism anyone has of British foreign policy, the way to express that criticism is through the ballot box, by raising your concerns with your MP, and by taking a public stand – never, ever, by violence.
I would also like to pay tribute today to Shahbaz Bhatti, the Pakistani Minister for Minorities, who was murdered by violent extremists in Islamabad yesterday. Mr Bhatti was fearless in his pursuit of tolerance, and liberty, continuing to argue for freedom of religious expression even though he knew this would put his life in danger. A reminder, if one were needed, that liberty can extract a much higher price than most of us are likely to pay.
We need to deepen our understanding of the roots of violent extremism. It is a difficult task. In a moment I will address the interaction of individual, community and ideological influences. But I want to deal first with the specific question of economic insecurity.
As I have said, openness and confidence go hand in hand: remaining open to different cultures and attitudes is easier for people, communities and nations that are confident of their own position.
This means that fear and insecurity are among the most dangerous enemies of openness and liberalism.
There is also no question that insecurity – whether economic or social – creates more fertile ground for violent extremism. During these challenging economic times, we will have to work even harder to fight violent extremism in all its forms.
Recent research by the Searchlight Educational Trust on attitudes towards immigration and multiculturalism shows that there is a minority at both ends of the scale with either straightforwardly positive or negative views about immigration and multiculturalism.
But in the middle are groups who are either culturally fairly conservative or who are concerned mainly with the economic implications of immigration. This last group – labelled ‘identity ambivalents’ by Searchlight – is the most worrying in the current climate. Economic difficulty could tip some of them into the negative camp.
At this point, the question becomes one of economic judgement. I strongly believe that acting decisively on the deficit is the surest way to restore economic confidence, relieve people of the burden of debt and put the country back on track. Delay will carry more cost, and more risk, than decisive action. Prevarication on the deficit will worsen economic insecurity, not alleviate it.
But a turn to violent extremism cannot be explained simply in economic terms. There are much deeper and more complex forces at work. The scholar Louise Richardson describes the causes of terrorism as ‘a lethal cocktail containing a disaffected individual, an enabling community and a legitimizing ideology’.
This is right. And it means that our response to violent extremism has to engage at all of these levels, too. So an open, confident society is made up of free, responsible individuals; strong, resilient communities; and a muscular, liberal ideology.
At all three levels – individual, community and society-wide – it is vital to pursue ‘smart engagement’. This means calibrating Government action in the following ways:
And in today’s world, individual identity is much more fluid. With advancements in communications technology, more freedom of movement and greater economic interdependence between nations, there is a much wider palette from which identities can be drawn. The increasing complexity of questions of identity makes it even more important to balance individual liberty and collective responsibility.
Freedom for individuals is one of the core values of the Coalition Government. That is why we have ended the injustice of 28-day detention without trial; why we have crushed the ID database; why we are ending the house arrest of Labour’s Control Orders; why we are giving people not charged of crimes the right to get their DNA off police databases; and why we are curtailing arbitrary powers of police to ‘stop and search’.
We are, in short, rebalancing the relationship between the state and the individual citizen. But we are clear that individuals need to take responsibility, too. Freedom not only comes hand in hand with responsibility, it requires it. As the liberal leader Jo Grimond said: ‘Freedom entails the acceptance of responsibility. Responsibility is meaningless without freedom.”
So while we will support the freedoms and human rights of individuals, we also insist that individuals meet their obligations towards wider society, and take their share of responsibility for the maintenance of liberal societies.
And while we have an unquenchable commitment to individual liberty, we have an equal commitment to safety and security – and I think the results of our recent counter-terrorism review struck the right balance.
Of course individuals do not live in a vacuum. We must always recognise that we are, in Bikhu Parekh’s words, “a community of citizens and a community of communities”.
The role of peers and communities in acting against or cultivating violence is clear. So we need an approach that empowers individuals – but builds communities too.
The former Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, said earlier this week that “we need to build the resilience of local communities to reject the politics of hatred.” I agree with him.
That is why this government is working so hard to help build stronger communities. At times, national security considerations will still require national action. But unlike the previous Government, we do not believe that strong communities are built from Whitehall. That’s why we have removed the ring fences around Local Authority budgets, allowing for local discretion; why we are introducing elected police commissioners so that policy can be locally accountable; why we are, through community budgets, giving power to localities to determine their own priorities; and why we are putting public health in the hands of local authorities. Strong communities are communities with more power over their own destiny.
But it is also crucially important to maintain a clear distinction between initiatives aimed at combating extremism and those focused on the broader task of community cohesion. The last Government’s conflation of social policy and security policy was damaging. It resulted in Muslim communities feeling stigmatised, and money being wasted.
That is why the Government is currently reviewing the Prevent programme, to ensure that money to curb violent extremism is targeted in the right way, and on the right groups. By treating Muslim communities and organisations as homogenous lumps to be variously hectored, preached at, showered with praise and money, or ignored, the previous Government created negative perceptions among British Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
We should ensure that public funds do not support any organisations promoting violence. We must engage with religious organisations in a smart way focusing our attention on those that support our essential liberal values.
We will also challenge extremism across the board, ending the previous Government’s exclusive and unhelpful focus on Islam. It does not matter if you are a far-right extremist, someone who perverts a religious faith, or someone who uses violence in support of other ideological ends – we will challenge you, take you on and defeat you.
The third battleground against violent extremism is at the level of ideas, values and ideology. The dangerous ideas that underpin violent extremism must never be allowed to go unchallenged.
That is why I thought the PM’s argument in favour of ‘muscular liberalism’ was absolutely right. Liberalism is not a passive, inert approach to politics. It requires engagement, assertion. Muscular liberals flex their muscles in open argument. There is nothing relativist about liberalism.
If we are truly confident about the strength of our liberal values we should be confident about their ability to defeat the inferior arguments of our opponents.
Smart engagement means engaging in argument at public events, where appropriate and at the right level. Of course these are always difficult decisions to make. But to take one example, the Global Peace and Unity conference attracts around fifty thousand British Muslims each year and is an important opportunity to engage in argument – and so Andrew Stunell, the Government’s Communities Minister did this year. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader, also spoke at the event.
Now there may well have been a small minority of organisations and individuals at that event with deeply unpalatable, illiberal views.
But you don’t win a fight by leaving the ring. You get in and win. The overwhelming majority of the people attending this conference are active, engaged and law-abiding citizens. We don’t win people to liberal ideals by giving ourselves a leave of absence from the argument.
Equally, smart engagement means being extremely careful about decisions to proscribe individual organisations. There are occasions when that is the right course of action. I have to say that, for me, agreeing to the proscription of the Pakistani Taliban was a straightforward decision.
But proscription must always be a last resort, never a knee-jerk reflex. That is why the Pakistani Taliban is the only organisation we have proscribed since entering Government. And that is why, consistent with our agenda for smart engagement and as part of the Government’s review of Counter Terrorism powers, we decided against increasing the government’s powers to proscribe.
Because of the requirement to engage in argument, liberal democracy means hard work. Open, liberal societies are not self-creating, or self-maintaining. Democracy, free speech and human rights have to be won – and tragically, often paid for in blood. We need only look to North Africa to see proof of that.
Once established, liberal societies still need to be renewed and re-established, generation after generation. It has been said that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. But it is also eternal labour – working to maintain the culture and institutions of liberal democracy.
Liberal societies do not expect everyone to live in the same way, or believe in the same things; conformity can crush liberty. But in liberal societies, all of us must defend the freedoms of others, in exchange for freedom for ourselves. In an open society, values compete but do not conflict.
This is the background against which we have to consider the issues of multiculturalism. We have to be clear what we mean here. Where multiculturalism is held to mean more segregation, other communities leading parallel lives, it is clearly wrong. For me, multiculturalism has to seen as a process by which people respect and communicate with each other, rather than build walls between each other. Welcoming diversity but resisting division: that’s the kind of multiculturalism of an open, confident society.
And the cultures in a multicultural society are not just ethnic or religious. Many of the cultural issues of the day cut right across these boundaries: gay rights; the role of women; identities across national borders; differing attitudes to marriage; the list goes on. Cultural disagreements are much more complex than much of the debate implies. If you will forgive the phrase, they are not quite so black and white.
So: smart engagement in defence of an open society. An unending determination to keep doing the hard work of maintaining our liberal society at home. Encouraging the birth and growth of liberal societies abroad. Smart engagement, appropriate and proportionate, to take on extremist ideas, alongside a ruthless determination to find and punish those who promote or take to violence.
Maintaining a liberal, open nation also demands a fierce allegiance to shared values. The values of liberal citizenship. The values of responsibility, tolerance and openness.
In the end, these values are the only weapons that can defeat the terrorists and hate-mongers, at home and abroad.
Violent extremists of all kinds are the enemies of open societies. We will wage an unceasing battle against them. And we will win.
Thank you.

Rishi Sunak,United Kingdom,2020-05-16,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your warm wishes.
This Government’s plan is one of the most comprehensive anywhere in the world. We have provided billions of pounds of cash grants, tax cuts and loans for over 1 million businesses, tens of billions of pounds of deferred taxes, income protection for millions of the self-employed, and a strengthened safety net to protect millions of our most vulnerable people. These schemes speak to my and this Conservative Government’s values. We believe in the dignity of work, and we are doing everything we can to protect people currently unable to work.
Yesterday my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out our plan for the next phase of the public health response, and today I can confirm the next stage of our job retention scheme. This scheme has been a world-leading economic intervention, supporting livelihoods and protecting futures. Seven and a half million jobs have been furloughed—jobs we could have lost if we had not acted—and nearly 1 million businesses supported who could have closed shop for good.
As we reopen the economy, we will need to support people back to work. We will do so in a measured way. I can announce today that the job retention scheme will be extended for four months, until the end of October. By that point, we will have provided eight months of support to British people and businesses. Until the end of July, there will be no changes whatsoever, from August to October the scheme will continue for all sectors and regions of the UK, but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work. Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. We will ask employers to start sharing with the Government the cost of paying people’s salaries.
Full details will follow by the end of May, but I want to assure people today of one thing that will not change: workers will, through the combined efforts of the Government and employers, continue to receive the same level of overall support as they do now, at 80% of their current salary, up to £2,500 a month.
I am extending the scheme because I will not give up on the people who rely on it. Our message today is simple. We stood behind Britain’s workers and businesses as we came into this crisis and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side.
",2020 Statement on the Covid-19 Economic Package,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2020-statement-on-the-covid-19-economic-package/
Jim McMahon,United Kingdom,2020-05-17,"I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of the statement. I also thank him for the way in which he has maintained communication and shown a willingness to work together in the national interest.
I know that everyone in this House and at home will join me in sending our thanks to all transport workers across the country. As with all our frontline workers, they are the very best of us. It is so important that we give a voice to those workers. Even today, the official advice is found wanting and it will lead to confusion. The scenes we saw yesterday on public transport were unsurprising when the Government ordered a return to work with 12 hours’ notice but without the guidance being in place on how people can be kept safe. May I therefore ask the Secretary of State why his announcement was not made before the Prime Minister’s statement on Sunday?
Secondly, the Government have produced guidance for bus passengers and operators, but it leaves too much to chance and fails to protect frontline workers. It risks a postcode lottery on standards and protection, and there is far too much “should”, “could”, “not always possible” and “as much as you can”, rather than clear, directive guidance. For bus drivers, for instance, the guidance is that PPE should not be used, but instead reserved for health and care staff. That is despite shocking figures released by the Office for National Statistics that show professional drivers, including those operating taxis, private hire vehicles, buses and goods vehicles, have some of the highest covid-19 fatality rates in the country. May I therefore ask the Secretary of State for the evidence base to support the position that the provision of PPE should not be provided for frontline staff on transport? What discussions have taken place to ensure co-operation across our devolved nations to offer clear and consistent standards for transport, such as buses and rail that, of course, crosses from nation to nation?
When the Secretary of State says he announced last week a £2 billion fund for cycling, it sounded awfully familiar. Will he confirm that that actually is not new money, but was instead announced pre-lockdown back in February? In that context, can he confirm whether it has now been paid to local councils?​
The Secretary of State touched on the aviation sector in the guidance that has been produced. A number of airlines have already announced a significant number of redundancies, affecting tens of thousands of jobs directly and throughout the supply chain.
Even as we transition to a green economy, protecting jobs now so that people can be reskilled for the future is critical. It will be far easier to transition from a point of strength rather than of weakness. The Government have failed to offer a sectoral deal for aviation. There is a real chance to set conditions on staff wages, payments to UK-based suppliers, a shift to green technology, demand that those who seek our help pay fairly into the tax system, as well as halt the payment of shareholder dividends. Why have the Government failed to act?
Aviation is not alone. We have seen this with ferry operators and the announcement of more than 1,100 jobs at risk with P&amp;O. The Prime Minister’s 14-day quarantine proposal is a total mess. It states that everyone must be quarantined, unless they come from anywhere in the world via France, which is one of the worst affected countries in Europe after the UK. Will the Government produce the scientific advice that justifies why France should be exempt from that policy? Why have the Government decided that now is the time to implement this measure, two months after other countries introduced it? More than 18 million passengers have entered the UK since January. Will the Government publish the scientific advice that led to that change now and not earlier?
Finally, we urgently need a comprehensive plan for transport. The public rightly demand an end to the chaos surrounding the exit plan. The risk is not just that more lives will be lost needlessly, but that the economic damage will be far deeper, hurting our communities for a generation to come. The Opposition will continue to work together in the national interest, but the Secretary of State must take a message back to the Cabinet table: no more confusion, no more reckless briefings, and no more delay. This is a national crisis that needs a Government who are fit to respond to it, and we hope for the country that that comes sooner, rather than later.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2019-06-19,"Well, this is a big day. Very important for a very important subject. Today it's my privilege to award our nation's highest civilian honor to the father of supply-side economics: Dr. Arthur Laffer. But this is a very special time for you.
This is a tremendous award. You have the Congressional Medal of Honor on the military side, which, of course, is something incredibly special. And the presidential medal is -- I just want to congratulate you. There's nothing like it, right?
Thank you very much, Art. Joining us for this momentous ceremony are Art's six children. Thank you very much. Congratulations. We just got back from Florida. That was a big night in Orlando, Mike. Right?
Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Alex Acosta, Elaine Chao, and Ben Carson, thank you very much for being here. And our top economic advisor and a great friend -- of all of us, actually. I hear that voice and I just say ""money, money, money."" Larry Kudlow. Larry. Thank you, Larry.
Few people in history have revolutionized economic thought and policy like Dr. Art Laffer. He developed a brilliant theory, shaped unprecedented economic reforms, and helped turn a severe recession into a remarkable boom. He proved that the most powerful way to grow the economy and raise government revenue was not to increase tax rates but to adopt strong incentives that unleash the power of human freedom and innovate, create jobs, and deliver greater opportunity to all Americans.
And he's proved it over and over again. A Yale graduate, Art went on to earn his PhD in Economics from Stanford University. He became the youngest-ever tenured professor at the University of Chicago. Oh, that's good. That wasn't too long, was it. He's a little older than he looks.
He looks like he's in his forties. Just a little bit, right?
Don't talk about it. Art then returned to the University of Chicago. At the start of the Ford administration, our nation's economic situation was becoming dire indeed.
We remember. In 1974 alone, 2 million Americans joined the unemployment lines, and inflation hit 11 percent. Right now, we have inflation at almost nothing. Don't you? It's good to read this because we read this and we realize how well we're doing right now. The consensus in Washington, on both sides of the aisle, was that the government could tax, inflate, and regulate its way to prosperity.
But Art had a different idea. Right? You did have a different idea. I'd have you tell it. It would be much more interesting, huh? In 1974, Art came to dinner with the White House Chief Staff -- Chief of Staff Don Rumsfeld; Deputy Chief of Staff Dick Cheney -- who's been, by the way, a tremendous supporter, and we appreciate Dick very much; and Wall Street Journal reporter Jude Wanniski.
The dinner has since become very, very legendary in many minds. Art drew on his napkin a series of lines and a curve that changed history. With the now famous ""Laffer Curve"" -- still, a very, very highly respected economic curve -- Art showed that if tax rates are too high, people stop spending and they stop investing.
The result is less growth and lower tax revenues. On the other hand, at the certain point on the curve, lower tax rates spur investment, economic growth, and raise government revenue. I think Steve Forbes agrees with that. I've heard you for a long time talking about that. Very much agree.
Prominent academics called this theory ""insanity,"" ""totally wacky,"" and ""completely off the wall."" With optimism, confidence, and exceptional intellect, Art would go on to prove them all wrong. He proved them wrong on a number of occasions. In 1978, California Governor Jerry Brown asked Art to help him implement Proposition 13, which the people had overwhelmingly enacted to dramatically reduce the state property tax.
I think they could use it again out there, by the way. They should do that immediately. The results were so successful that job creation soon grew at twice the nationwide rate. Within two years, 43 states adopted similar reforms. During that same period, Art also advised Ronald Reagan, and helped shape his low-tax, pro-growth agenda.
After President Reagan's election, Art served on the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board. He played a vital role in both the 1981 and 1986 tax rate cuts, which ultimately lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. That's not bad. That's a pretty big reduction, I would say.
The Reagan economy soared, creating sustained economic growth, shrinking poverty, expanding incomes, and dramatically increasing federal revenue. Sounds very familiar. Sounds very, very familiar, actually. Our economy has never, ever been stronger than it is today. Dr. Laffer's policies not only expanded opportunity for our citizens; they spurred economic reforms around the world and helped lift untold millions out of poverty.
Art has advised many world leaders, including former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- a great one. Staying true to the pro-growth vision that Dr. Laffer helped develop, in 2017, we passed historic tax cuts and reforms into law. Now, unemployment has reached its lowest level in over 51 years, with fast-growing wages, low inflation, and real GDP. And this is GDP growth that's higher than anybody ever thought possible.
First quarter was 3.2. And everybody said the first quarter is not going to be so good because the first quarter is never very good for us. But it was not only good; it was double and even triple what people expected. And we're going to see some other very pleasant surprises, especially when the trade deals are all worked out.
And they're coming along very well, Art, as you know. Our tax cuts and reforms also created Opportunity Zones in distressed communities, another idea that Dr. Laffer helped develop early in his career. In 1999, TIME magazine named Dr. Laffer one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. Former Wall Street Journal reporter Jude Wanniski wrote, ""In studying public finance, there is nothing more important than an appreciation of the Laffer Curve."" I've heard and studied the Laffer Curve for many years in the Wharton School of Finance.
It's a very important thing that you've done, Art. Very important. Dr. Laffer helped inspire, guide, and implement extraordinary economic reforms that recognize the power of human freedom and ingenuity to grow our economy and lift families out of poverty and into a really bright future. Today, our nation is stronger, our people more prosperous, and the world a much better place because of the brilliance and boldness of Dr. Arthur Laffer.
And it's now my profound honor to ask the military aide to come forward as I present Dr. Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It's my great honor. Thank you.
This is your day.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Awards the Medal of Freedom to Arthur Laffer,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-medal-of-honor-arthur-laffer-june-19-2019
Jeff Rooker,United Kingdom,2015-12-01,"I am pleased that I have been given the opportunity to address this lunch. It has long been recognised that the poultry industry represents a great success story for UK agriculture. A success that has come about with little or no support from the Common Agricultural Policy.
Despite the lightness of the CAP regime for your sector the Ministry’s work does of course impinge on your industry in a number of ways.
Firstly, of course, there is the forthcoming establishment of the Food Standards Agency. This reflects consumers concern about the safety of the food they eat. But it would be quite wrong to see this development as conflicting with the ideal of a healthy and successful food industry. In fact, the opposite is true: the Government believes that UK food producers stand to benefit both domestically and abroad from the increased confidence in the safety of our food which the FSA should bring.
To back this up, we are building in safeguards to ensure that the agency does not impose disproportionate costs and burdens on British producers which are not justified on safety grounds. The rules under which the FSA operates will enshrine the principle that its actions should be proportionate to risk, and pay due regard to the costs as well as benefits to those affected by them.
Moving on, I know from your Federation’s detailed and well thought-out response to the White Paper that our plans to shift some of the costs of food safety work from the taxpayer to the industry are worrying you. This question perhaps provoked the biggest reaction in our consultation, with many strong views voiced from all quarters. It is our firm belief, however, that the food industry stands to benefit in the long term from the new food safety arrangements, and that it is only fair that it should pay its share of their costs.
But we do recognise that the area is complex, and we want to make sure that the final arrangements are both equitable and workable. We shall therefore be consulting on questions such as the scope of any scheme and the basis for calculating charges, including the need to take account of the size and type of the business, before we finalise our proposals.
Still on charges, I am aware of your concerns over Veterinary Medicine Directorate charges for residues surveillance which will raise more money from the UK poultry meat industry than is actually needed to carry out the sort of cost-effective residue testing programme the VMD is committed to. You know, however, that the level of charge is set directly by EU legislation and that the Commission will be closely monitoring our compliance. I firmly believe that the extension of the VMD statutory programme to poultry significantly enhances the protection available to the consumer. All results from the programme will be published along with brand names for those above the action level and all such positives will be followed up with farmer and his veterinary adviser.
I know the VMD have suggested ways in which to mitigate this problem. I have asked them to continue to be pro-active with your representatives and can assure you we will seek to re-negotiate the poultry residue charge set out in the EU legislation should the opportunity arise.
The levels of salmonella infection in the national poultry flocks continues to be a matter of concern. The ACMSF has looked at this area in detail, and its Report on Poultry Meat provides clear direction for the industry. In addition, the Forward Programme for the Poultry Meat Industry, in which the British Poultry Meat Federation were involved, indicates the way in which HACCP can be applied in the slaughterhouse.
I am pleased that the levels of salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium in broiler breeder flocks has been reduced. The policy of eradication in the breeding pyramid, which we have been concentrating on, does appear to be working.
I hear that the level of infection in the broiler flocks has also reduced significantly in recent years – perhaps to as low as 10% in some cases. Again, this deserves recognition, but I believe further progress is possible. The ACMSF saw no reason in principle why the prevalence of salmonella contamination in chickens on retail sale should not be reduced to single figures in percentage terms, on the basis of existing technology. The Department of Health will be conducting a survey on salmonella in UK produced chickens on retail sale later this year. As you know from the White Paper, the scope for pathogen reduction throughout the food chain in general is a subject in which we propose the Food Standards Agency will take a close interest. The continued co-operation of the whole industry will be essential in order to build on the progress made so far.
You may know that the European Commission has started its review of the original Zoonoses Directive. We will consult the industry as the review progresses.
Although it considered the risk to be small, it felt that recycling pig and poultry waste as feed for the same species could create the potential to spread disease, and recommended that the Government should remove this risk in discussion with our European partners. We have accepted SEAC’s recommendations and have asked the Commission to schedule early discussions about a possible ban on the use of poultry and feather waste as poultry feed within the European Community.
With regard to mammalian meat and bone meal I should say that there are very good reasons why our own controls on feed are more restrictive than those in place elsewhere, in countries where mammalian meat and bone meal can be fed to poultry. The Uk has had far more cases of BSE than any other country. Consequently we have to maintain stringent controls in order to remove the risk of ruminant diets being infected, either directly or through cross-contamination, with the disease agent.
Last year I announced that there would be a review under the Poultry Meat Hygiene Regulations, to look at the current exemption from licensing of those premises with an annual slaughter of less than 10,000 birds. This exemption affects both on-farm production and small slaughterhouses. The issue relates to the European Community wide prohibition on the production of New York dressed poultry, to issues of food safety and to the maintenance of a level playing field for all of the poultry industry.
This review is now under way within the Ministry, and we plan to have proposals ready for consultation in the summer. As I have promised, there will be a full public consultation, including the industry. The review will address all aspects of the issue, and consider all the practicalities of the various options available. I look forward to receiving the contributions of this Federation and of this industry to our proposals.
There are, of course, other policy areas that are of concern to you as producers, such as animal welfare and environmental protection measures.
It is important to strive to improve minimum standards on animal welfare. Obviously this is best done at international level if we are to achieve real improvements and not just open up our market to products produced elsewhere to lower welfare standards. There are encouraging signs of progress on this front but realistically the adoption of agreed EU minimum standards is likely to take some time. Meanwhile, as you know, there are pressures on us to legislate at national level and consumers and retailers are continuing to demand reassurance as to welfare standards. It is important therefore to show that progress is being made voluntarily by the industry to improve welfare.
You will all also be aware that the public is more conscious of the impact of agriculture on the environment. It is important that the industry takes a responsible attitude to how it organises its various operations, and takes care that those which might cause pollution do not do so.
The Ministry provides advice on preventing pollution, for example, through the Codes of Good Agricultural Practice. In the near future there will be legislation aimed at requiring an integrated approach. The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive will affect a wide range of businesses, including some in agriculture. Of specific interest to you is the fact that it will apply to poultry businesses which have more than 40,000 birds. It will also apply to installations which process raw animal material including poultry meat, as well as slaughterhouses and animal renderers.
The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is in the lead on the implementation of this Directive, but the Ministry is closely involved in the discussions and you have been, and will continue to be, consulted as the implementation process develops towards legislation and the guidance to comply with that legislation.
Agriculture, including poultry businesses, will also be affected by the development of the EU Acidification Strategy. There is still some way to go on discussion of the Strategy. In particular, national emission targets which will limit emissions of the acidifying gases including ammonia, the gas most relevant to agriculture, have not been agreed. Once again the Ministry will continue to keep you informed of, and consult uyou on, developments.
Let me turn to the subject of trade, which I know is of major concern to the Federation. Informal preparatory work has already begun at the WTO in Geneva under the WTO Agriculture Committee, involving the analysis and exchange of information between member countries to help them prepare their positions for the next Round.
What will the Government be looking for in the next Round ? The Uruguay Round was a significant step forward in terms of bringing agriculture under international trade disciplines, but there is still a great deal to be done in terms of policy reform and reducing protectionism. So we will be looking to the next Round to achieve further liberalisation of trade and reductions in agricultural support and protectionism.
This means lower tariffs, larger import quotas and tighter limits on export subsidies. And there will be pressure on domestic agricultural support, which will have to either be decoupled from production or live within tighter limits.
Having said that the Government support trade liberalisation, I know that a major concern of your industry is the increased volume of imported chicken particularly from Brazil and Thailand. The fact is that the Community is committed, under the Uruguay Round settlement, to provide a minimum level of access for imports of products including poultry-meat. This level of market access is bound to go up after the next WTO Round as the trend towards further liberalisation continues.
But the Uruguay Round also allows countries to take action in circumstances where the volume of imports has risen dramatically, or their price fallen. As you know, the Community has exercised its right to take this special safeguard action in your sector.
Under the forthcoming Poultrymeat Marketinbg Regulations THIRD country of origin will be required on labels for both pre-packaged and unpackaged poultrymeat. The latter is an option that the UK has decided to take.
We will continue to monitor the trend in imports closely and to discuss with you the effect on the UK market and industry. But the trend is clearly towards more liberal trade, and I urge you to be prepared, in the longer term, to operate in a more open and internationally-competitive environment.
One of my main concerns in this area is to ensure that the market for poultry meat in the UK, and the opportunities for export, are not undermined by producers in other European Union Member States who are not complying with the hygiene conditions laid down in Community law. I know that this is a particular concern for the Federation at this time. We do not have an easy task given the fact that trade in poultry meat is not normally dependant on official health certification and there will always be unscrupulous traders who seek to circumvent the rules for their own ends. The problem is not helped by the fact that some Member States have failed to transpose Community directives into their national law. But this does not excuse them from ensuring that their producers meet the conditions laid down in those directives.
We are very keen to bring examples of transgressions by traders in other Member States to the attention of the authorities in those countries. But we need your help in order to identify problems and I am pleased to say that we have been getting it.
Finally can I say that your Federation has effectively represented the views of your industry on the establishment of the FSA, on the implementation of the Poultry Meat Marketing Standards enforcement regime and on a whole range of other issues. These contributions are greatly appreciated and valued by the government, and long may they continue. Thank you.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-05-05,"Well, thank you very much. We very much appreciate this time, and I'm with some very good friends. We've been friends for a long time. And we're working together very closely.
I'm honored to be with you today to discuss the unprecedented actions my administration has taken to support our treasured Native American communities. Together, we're fighting for everybody, but we're fighting this horrible coronavirus. It's a tough opponent, but we're winning and we're starting to see our country come back. It's been a very exciting few days. We're starting to see it all come back.
We're improving the lives of Native American families and tribes more than any administration has done by far.
We're grateful to be joined by Governor Doug Ducey. And thank you very much, Doug, for being with us.
Secretary Eugene Scalia. Thank you, Eugene.
Senator Martha McSally, who's doing very well. I hear things are very good. You're doing great. Thank you, Martha.
Vice President of Naho- -- Navajo Nation, Myron Liz- -- Lizer. And -- and, by the way, we appreciate it very much. And you know there is two ways of saying that name. They told me outside, but I always think of it as ""Lezer."" So how do you like it? How do you like it?
That's what I thought. Okay. Thanks, Myron, very much. And Second Lady, thank you very much for being here. We really, really appreciate it.
The Navajo Nation has been very special to a lot of people. And it's certainly been very special to the state. And the relationship, Doug, I think is extraordinary, isn't it --
-- when you get right down to it. So thank you very much and we very much appreciate it.
Native Americans have been hit hard by the terrible pandemic. Over 2,000 members of the Navajo Nation have tested positive for the coronavirus. And tragically, more than 70 have lost their lives.
How is it looking right now? How is it doing?
That's a lot. Mitigation-wise, you're doing what?
But what we're doing, you know, we're bringing these two -- these are very hard to come by, because they're very popular. This is done by Abbott Laboratories. And we're bringing them for you. And these are the quick tests, and they're very accurate and very fast.
So we're doing that. I think we have a thousand cartridges, too. A thousand for a thousand tests. So hopefully that'll be -- that'll be helpful to you. Okay?
We appreciate it because you've done a fantastic job. You've been great friends.
Native Americans have been hit hard by this terrible pandemic. Over 2,000 members of the Navajo Nation have really -- I mean, it's been incredible what's taken place, and there's nothing we can say. But the coronavirus is tragically -- as you just said, 70 people lost their lives.
The administration is deploying the full resources of the federal government to support and protect our Native American communities in this very grave time of need. And I know that -- I think I can speak very strongly for Martha and for the governor: We're full hands on deck. And you're working very hard. I know that, Doug. Very, very hard. And even Department of Labor, it's -- it's been -- it's been working very hard with everybody that's in this room and everybody that's -- that needs to be. Right?
Anything you'd have to say, by the way, Gene, while you're here? Please.
And I'd like to introduce also, the governor, Stephen Lewis, who's been terrific and working with us very hard. Thank you very much, Stephen. That's fantastic. We appreciate it very much.
How is it going?
That's Gila. Gila River.
Right.
That's beautiful territory, isn't it?
But it's -- how are you -- how are you doing, in terms of the amount? What are your numbers now? As of today, what are your numbers?
Right.
That's right.
That's great.
That's fantastic. Good. And you'll have the ventilators very soon I know, right?
Knowing Doug. They're good ventilators too, aren't they?
Right? They're really good.
Weeks ago, I signed the CARES Act, which includes $8 billion to help tribal governments. And I want to thank Senator McSally for fighting hard to get those funds and get them here and get them to a lot of different people all over the country, including to the folks in this room. So I want to thank you, Martha. You've done a fantastic job.
You really have.
This is the single largest investment in Indian country in our history. So the amount of money that's being sent to ""Indian country,"" as we call it, is the largest amount in the history of the U.S. And you deserve it. And you've been through a lot. The Navajo Nation will soon receive over $600 million. That's a lot. Should I renegotiate that? Can we renegotiate that.
."" I understand. I've heard that before.
The Gila River will receive, and -- and I think you probably know all about this, but we're giving you some information: $40 million. And you're going to use that very well. I know that because I know you. You're going to be given $40 million in initial funds to help protect their citizens from the scourge, from the plague, from what we're all fighting in this country. Should have never happened. Should have been contained from where it came.
Since I took office, my administration has also worked to repatriate precious Native American artifacts, to protect children in the care of the Indian Health and Indian Health Service, and to make eagle remains more easily accessible for cultural and religious purposes, and to highlight the contributions of Native American veterans throughout the history of our nation.
So you know all those elements. And the eagle remains is a very important thing to you, right?
Very important. Yeah. That's great. That's great.
Last year, I signed the first presidential proclamation recognizing the tragedy of missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives. We also launched Operation Lady Justice and provided $273 million to improve public safety in Native American tribal communities.
At the end of this event, I will once again sign a proclamation recognizing Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Native Awareness Day. It's been a tremendous problem: missing and murdered American Indians. It's been a tre- -- could you discuss that for a second, please?
Good. I'd like to have the Second Lady -- go ahead, please.
Right.
Yeah, that's right.
So this has been far disproportionate to other people in other areas of the country, what you -- what you've gone through. I mean, I've been hearing about this for a long time.
For years and years. This has been for many years, for many decades, right?
Disproportionate.
Well, $273 million -- a lot of that's going to go toward trying to solve that problem. It's a problem that can be solved.
But I know you're going to use it well.
And you'll figure it out, right?
It's a horrible -- it's a horrible thing. So New Mexico versus Arizona. What -- tell me, because we're here. Where -- where are you going to be -- where -- where's the problem worse: New Mexico or Arizona?
Is there a certain area, though -- you have the four states -- is there a certain area where the problem is exacerbated or worse? Or is it evenly spread?
It's Indian country.
Yeah.
It's a very big problem in Alaska.
It is a vast -- yeah, it's a vast land.
Well, I'm going to be signing something in a couple of moments, and I hope it helps a lot. Not just a little bit, a lot.
And I think you'll do a fantastic job. I know you're going to be watching it personally.
And between the three of you and everyone else that I know so well, I think you're going to do a great job. And so, go get them.
Go do the job. I'd like to maybe finish off with the governor. A great governor. You're doing a phenomenal job. What do you have to say, Doug?
Well, thank you very much. And, you know, one of the other accomplishments we have is -- in Arizona and a lot of other states -- we're building a wall. And you're finally getting what you need.
And interestingly, California is calling because, in a -- bordering towns, as you know, in Mexico, they have a very big outbreak of the coronavirus. And California is calling saying, ""You got to help us."" Those are not calls that the media knows about, but that's the facts.
And in Tijuana, right along the border, they have a tremendous outbreak. And we have just completed 172 miles of wall. And it's real wall, not the kind you were having built over the years that were sort of scoffed at, right?
And we've done a lot in Arizona, and the people are letting us know. They're so happy. They're so thrilled about it. It's made a tremendous difference.
And we've had one of the best months ever, in the history of our country, for not having people come in that we don't want -- that we don't want in our country. We want to have the people that come in the right way.
So you see the numbers. The numbers are about the best we've ever had in the history of the country. So -- so it's good, but we're getting that done. I guess you see -- do you see where they're doing it?
Yeah, it's been a big -- it's a big thing. A hundred and -- we're up to 172 miles. We'll have it completed early next year. So it's been -- it's been something.
Okay, I'm going to sign this. I want to just congratulate you, Myron.
I want to congratulate you, Second Lady. That's so fantastic.
And I want to congratulate you for -- also, because I've -- I've been in that vicinity. And it's one of the most beautiful places you can imagine. So congratulations very much.
Thank you, Stephen.
Okay.
Wait one second, please.
One second, Jim.
Okay? I want to make sure they -- everybody looks good, except me. Okay? If you don't mind.
Yeah, go ahead. Please.
Yeah, Stephen, go ahead.
That's right.
That's great.
Thank you very much, Stephen. I appreciate it. And I have to say, Myron Lizer and I have dealt, and we've -- our people have dealt together very closely, and the Second Lady. And a lot of progress has been made, and we'll continue to make a lot of progress. I think you'll see that. And I think you're going to see it not only here, but in the future.
Thank you very much, and I appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you.
And I don't have to thank you. You're with the administration. You know, he's got good genes, right? The Scalia genes.
Go ahead, Jim.
Well, I think we're looking at phase two, and we're looking at other phases. The country is starting to open up. The task force has done a phenomenal job.
We have a chart that I just showed somebody. We just got it this morning, as I was getting off the plane. The -- and Governor Ducey can explain it better than anybody. When we came in, ventilators were a very, very big deal and very hard to produce. It's -- I say, but it is largely true -- the complexity is sort of like building a car. We opened up operations all over the country to build them.
And we -- there was -- hasn't been one person that needed a ventilator that didn't get it, which is amazing. And now we're helping other countries, and we're stockpiling in case some tragedy like this happens again.
But this just came out on testing. Because I think we are at the point or maybe we'll soon be at the point where I can say the exact same thing on testing. These numbers were just released. And this is the United States: the amount of testing and our level of testing and the quality of testing. This is just from Abbott Laboratories.
This is -- you know what this one is, Jim, it's a five-minute test. It's a great test. So it's something people like because you don't have to go through a laboratory. You don't have to send it in and send it back, and it takes a couple of days if they do a good job. So this is the testing.
So this is the testing, and the line here is the United States; we're over 7 million tests. Germany is at two and a half. Italy is less than that. Japan is down here. And South Korea, which we talk about -- and again, I'm very friendly with South Korea and with the President of South Korea, and he calls to congratulate us on our great testing -- South Korea is over here.
One of the reasons we have more cases than any other country by far is because we test much more. So if you test, you're going to have more cases. If we tested down here, we wouldn't have very many cases. You know, they like to say we have more cases than anybody. But the fact is, when you look at these numbers -- and this is the official count. Now, I can't tell you whether or not other countries are giving us the straight deal, but I can say that I know one thing: It's only going to be on the high side. It's not going to be on the low side.
So this is the other countries. These are the United States. And it's incredible. Remember this, and I think it's important to say this, Jim: The quality of our test is also the best. I mean, it's acknowledged to be the best.
So again, when we have cases -- we have more cases than anybody else -- does anybody really believe that we have more cases than China? But they don't talk about numbers like this. And other countries. But we report everything.
And I just -- I just want to say that we've done an incredible job on testing. With that being said, we have some additional, including antibody tests, coming out that will even blow these numbers away. But nobody has done the job we've done.
Go ahead.
Well -- well, yeah. We will have certain people -- as an example, we have hospitals that we built. We have medical centers that we built. We have people on the task force that focus on that. We have people in the task force that's focused exclusively on ventilators. Well, we have more ventilators now than anybody in the world, and we're helping France, as you know. We're helping France, Italy, Spain, Nigeria. We just -- we're giving, I think, 250 to Nigeria. We have many countries that we're helping. But the ventilator problem is solved, so you don't need that.
We have now a different -- it's sort of a combination of safety and reopening. So we'll have something in a different form. But the task force, for what we've done -- I think everybody out there, when they're being very honest, I think the job we've done on testing will shortly be -- and maybe even supersede, Doug -- the job that we've done on ventilators, which people can't even believe.
We had a call the other day with the governors. Mike Pence took the call. And they had, I believe, all 50 governors. And it was, they say, the best call we've had thus far. We're working closely with the governors. They have everything they need. And if they don't have it, and if they don't need it, or if they can't get it locally, then they know that we are stocked and we are ready.
And we can have -- as an example, we won't need this, but we were ready for weeks to have -- we had 10,000 ventilators sitting in various locations with people by the ventilators ready to have those ventilators roll, if they needed them in, as an example, Detroit or various other places all over the country.
So I think that, as far as the task force, Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job. But we're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we'll -- we'll have a different group probably set up for that.
No, no. Not at all. The mission accomplished is when it's over. When it's over, Jim, mission accomplished. No, I wouldn't say that at all.
What?
What does that mean? Go ahead. Repeat your question. Say it?
Oh, yeah. We have great advice. We have great people. We have great people. Yeah, we have great doctors. We have great medical people, laboratory people.
I have to say, I think tremendous progress is being made on vaccines, which everybody should be very happy to hear. And therapeutically, I think we're making very good progress too. We're making tremendous progress.
We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest laboratories in the world. And I have to say, we're working with other nations. We're working with UK. We're working with Germany. We're working with various other nations who are very advanced and doing a good job.
I think therapeutically and also from the standpoint of laboratories, we are -- laboratories, as it pertains to vaccines -- we're doing very well. I'd love to see a therapeutic answer, even before the vaccine, because we could take care of, you know, people that have a current -- a current problem or dilemma.
But therapeutically and for the vaccines, a tremendous amount of progress. Oxford, Johnson & Johnson -- incredible places -- are doing, I think, a really good job. And they're very advanced, but we have to now see. We're going up to that very delicate final stage with a number. I think a number of other countries that are also doing quite well, my people say.
And just so you know, working very closely with other countries. And whoever gets it first, my hat is off to them. We're not looking for first, second, or third. We're looking to get a vaccine that works. And progress has been made.
Well, because we can't keep our country closed for the next five years, you know. You could say there might be a recurrence, and there might be. And, you know, most doctors or some doctors say that it will happen and it'll be a flame and we're going to put the flame out.
We've learned a lot. You know, we've learned a lot about the coronavirus. We've learned a lot about this hidden enemy. It's a dangerous enemy; it's a bad enemy. You see what it does, especially for people over a certain age and people that have an infirmity. If you have diabetes, if you have a bad heart, if you have a certain problem, it just -- Myron, it just goes after you. It's vicious.
And we're saying that people that are over 60, 65 -- but over 60, we're even saying -- sort of stay back for a while. We recommend you staying back for a while. At the same time, with young children and children, we'd like to see the schools open early next season and on time. It's incredible how the -- it's very unique how the children aren't affected, but people that have problems and older people are -- can be very badly hurt, injured, or die from this problem.
Oh, they are looking at it very closely. They are looking at it very closely. And I tell -- I just said it today. I used the word for the first time, I think, in terms of what we're doing. I'm viewing our great citizens of this country, to a certain extent and to a large extent, as warriors. They're warriors. We can't keep our country closed. We have to open our country.
Somebody said, ""Oh, we could keep it for the next 18 months. We could keep it for the next two years."" Doug Ducey has done an incredible job as the governor of Arizona. The people aren't going to accept it. They won't accept it, and they shouldn't accept it. We have a great country. We can't keep it closed. I mean, I've had doctors say, ""Well, why don't we close it for a couple of years?"" This is the United States of America.
I created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, the greatest that we've ever had. The greatest employment numbers. The best numbers we've ever had. The best stock markets. I think we had 144 days of record stock markets.
And then, one day, they said we have to close our country. Well, now it's time to open it up. And you know what? The people of our country are warriors, and I'm looking at it. I'm not saying anything is perfect. And, yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.
Maybe I could ask, Doug, if you'd like to address that point.
Oh, sure. Yeah. They will be, and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field.
But we've learned a lot. As Doug said, we've learned a lot. It's -- you're going to probably have fires here, Doug; you'll put them out. You're going to put them out, and you'll put them out fast.
So, yeah, we -- we're bringing our country back. And I think what is going to happen -- just said it a little while ago -- you're going to have a third quarter where you're going to have transition. You'll have a big, beautiful -- hopefully a very good transition, a very successful transition back into the real world. And then you're going to have a fourth quarter that I think is going to do very well. And then I think next year, I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had, because we have stimulus and we have a pent-up demand like I have never seen before.
You know, today is a very interesting day because it's my first day out. And Doug reminded me of something. I didn't do it for that reason, but you said, ""This the first place you stopped when you ran,"" when I ran for something that turned out to be a very successful run. And we had tremendous crowds -- remember? -- at the convention center in Phoenix. And it was pretty incredible. And I didn't do it for that reason, interestingly, but here we are. And it was great that you reminded us of that fact.
But, look, we're going to have a very interesting transition period into the fourth quarter. I think your fourth quarter is going to be very good, and I think next year is going to be one of the best years, economically, we've ever had.
With that said, for those people that have lost somebody, for the people that have lost a loved one, even a close friend, you know, nothing can ever happen that's going to replace that. You know, I don't care what kind of a year you have from an economic standpoint, nobody is ever going to replace that.
But I think, from an economic standpoint -- purely an economic standpoint -- I think next year is potentially going to be one of the best years we've had. There's tremendous stimulus out there. And people want to get out. They want to go and they want to go to town. This country was founded on certain principles, and those principles are at work like you've never seen before.
So I want to thank you all very much. Thank you. And we'll see you perhaps at the next stop. Thank you.
Yeah. What about it, Jim?
Will I take it?
If they would like me to, I'd go the first one or I'd go the last one. I don't want to waste it.
But he's just saying, ""If there's a vaccine, would you take it?"" And she might like it that it didn't work too well, okay? But that's okay.
I would absolutely, Jim. If there's a vaccine and if they wanted me to be first on line, I'd be first on line, or I'd be last on line, or I wouldn't take it at all -- whatever is best for the country.
Okay? Thank you.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds Roundtable on Supporting Native Americans in Phoenix,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-native-american-roundtable-phoenix-may-5-2020
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-04-02,"Okay. Thank you very much. Good to be with you all. We re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus. It's vital that every American follows our guidelines on the 30 Days to Slow the Spread. The sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless American lives saved. We're going to save a lot of American lives.
And we're in control of our own fate very much so. Maintaining social distance, practicing vigorous hygiene, and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger. While you're fighting this battle from home, we're working with the best scientists, doctors, and researchers anywhere in the world.
We're racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus, as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine. And we're making a lot of progress. I think, medically, a lot of progress. At the same time, we're also racing to get relief to American workers and small businesses, as you know. I want to remind small-business owners across America that the Paycheck Protection Program is launching tomorrow.
Nearly $350 billion in loans will be available to small businesses, including sole proprietors. These loans are up to 100 percent forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers. Got to take care of your workers. Furthermore, we want Social Security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return, they don't have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to American citizens.
The Treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts. And don't forget, I will always protect your Social Security, your Medicare, and your Medicaid. We're protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and I always will. I'd like now to invite SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, who s doing a fantastic job -- she's going to be very busy in the next little while -- and Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives.
And then we'll get on to the attack of the virus itself. And please, if I might, Steve and Jovita.
Thank you, Jovita. Very good. Thank you.
Thank you, Steve. For Jovita or Steve, any questions, please?
Okay? Thank you all very much.
Thank you, Jovita. Thank you, Steve. Great job. Thank you. Okay, so that begins right away and they start handing out checks. And a lot of people are going to have their businesses built back up quickly, I hope. And we'll see. It s complicated, big. Small business is actually big business. So I thank them both.
And please -- good. We have some great gentlemen. Let me see. Great gentlemen. That's correct. Thank you very much. Today, my administration is also issuing new guidelines to protect elderly Americans who remain the most vulnerable. By now, nursing homes should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel.
Today, we're further recommending that all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread. And we're also urging facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents. And this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future, long after the enemy is gone -- this particular enemy is gone.
We're also making every effort to provide relief to our great veterans. We take very good care of our veterans. At my direction, Secretary Wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefits and to postpone debt collections. We're now conducting well over 100,000 coronavirus tests per day.
It's over a thou- -- a hundred thousand test a day --and these are accurate tests and they're moving rapidly -- which is more than any other country in the world, both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis. The most. The FDA has also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed by Cellex, a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system.
Moments ago, I directed Secretary Azar and Acting Secretary Wolf to use any and all available authority under the Defense Production Act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supplies they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe cases of C-O-V-I-D 19. You know what that is, right? Become a very famous term: C-O-V-I-D -- COVID.
This action will help General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, Royal Philips, and Vyaire Medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators. We have over 100,000 being built right now, or soon to be started. We anticipate issuing more orders under the Defense Production Act in the very near future.
In addition to the one that I've just signed against 3M for facemasks -- we just signed an element of the Act against 3M. And hopefully they'll be able to do what they are supposed to do. I just spoke to Mary Barra of General Motors and she said they're very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilators.
They have a lot of ventilators that they've committed to build, and they'll be starting very, very quickly. FEMA continues to deliver resources to areas most affected by the virus, including New York. On top of the 3,000 beds we're already providing to the Javits Center, the Department of Defense is adding another 48 ICU beds.
Governor Cuomo has asked that this facility go -- and it's a big, beautiful facility -- it be converted to a COVID hospital. And we hadn't done that yet. We hadn't thought in terms of doing that. But their use is -- their real demand is for that. And we had meetings on it with the task force. We had meetings with the military.
And I've decided to say, Yes, I'm going to do that, that I will be signing and agreeing to a yes answer. So that -- we will be doing that, and also, we will be staffing it. So the federal government is doing a lot of things that wasn't anticipated that it do. This is a 2,500 -- and/or 2,900 can easily be set up -- hospital built in Javits Center.
And so we're going to be converting that to a COVID-19 hospital. And it's going to be staffed by the military and by the federal government. And based on the fact that I agreed to that, we had two other facilities that were likewise asking for it, and that would be in Louisiana and also in Dallas. And we'll be doing those.
We spoke to the governor of Louisiana, spoke to the governor of Texas. And we've told them that we will be staffing those hospitals, again, above and beyond, but that's okay. We have to do that. In addition, the USNS Comfort is docked in New York to accept patients. That is a non-COVID. To date, FEMA has delivered more than 4 million N95 mask respirators.
And it's -- think of that: 4 million. Four million. Don't forget, we're a secondary source. The states are doing it and we're backing them up. But we've gotten 4 million N95 respirators, 1.8 million surgical masks, 460,000 face shields, 1.4 million gloves, and 4,400 ventilators just to the city and to the state of New York.
And some of them now are being sent. I spoke with both Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio a little while ago, and some of them are being sent to the city. All of America stands with the people of New York in this time of need. It's definitely a hotspot, but we have other hotspots also. And we're taking them -- taking care of them very, very strongly, very powerfully.
We have the finest people in the world in those locations. And I think the federal government has not only acted early but acted quickly, professionally. There's no people like this. Doctors, nurses, first responders, and other healthcare providers who want to help New York at this critical time should visit website NYC.gov/HelpNow.
NYC.gov/HelpNow. They need help now. They need people to help them. We have great facilities, and we've built some brand-new facilities, big ones, but we need help. We need help for professional people. So if you're in an area that isn't so affected and you're a doctor, a nurse, a healthcare worker, please get to that website.
And we would really appreciate your help. New York City needs it. Louisiana, by the way, needs it. Michigan needs it. Whatever you can do. Those are very strong hotspots; they need help. In recent weeks, as the virus has spread and economic hardship has followed, we have seen Americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion.
I want to remind everyone here in our nation's capital, especially in Congress, that this is not the time for politics, endless partisan investigations. Here we go again. Have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years. You see what happens. It's witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt.
And in the end, the people doing the witch hunt have been losing, and they've been losing by a lot. And it's not any time for witch hunts. It's time to get this enemy defeated. Conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources, time, attention. And we want to fight for American lives, not waste time and build up my poll numbers, because that's all they're doing because everyone knows it's ridiculous.
So we want to focus on the people of this country, even the people of the world -- we're going to be able to help them -- because, right now, as an example, we're building so many ventilators -- very, very hard to build -- but we're building thousands. Thousands of them. And a lot of them will be coming at a time when we won't need them as badly, because it takes time.
Very complex, very expensive. And we'll be able to help outside of our country. We think we'll be able to help. That s something that you cannot easily produce. As citizens, we re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection. There s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stirs in our hearts.
And that is so true. It's incredible the job that everybody has been doing. Everybody. They don't sleep. They don't go to bed. Sometimes they get nothing. I said to somebody recently on the task force, How many hours sleep have you gotten over the last couple of days? The answer was none. None. In one Massachusetts neighborhood, citizens come out of their homes each night at 8 o'clock from their porches and they sing God Bless America.
Others have joined in spreading from house to house, down one street, up to the next, until their little town with a spirit of patriotism, and reminding all Americans that we're all in this together. We'll fight together and we will win together. We're going to win this. Now, what I'd like to do is -- I'm going to step out.
We have a meeting on this subject. And I'm going to step out just for a few moments. I'll be right back. We'll answer some questions. But you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job, led by Vice President Mike Pence, head of the task force. And then Jared Kushner is going to say a few words.
And Admiral Polowczyk, Peter Navarro, Dr. Birx, and myself. I'll be right back. So I'll see you in a little while. I did take a test; it just came out. This is from the White House physician. You may have it. It just came out. I just took it this morning. And I took it. It took me literally a minute to take it. And it took me, I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes.
I went to work. I didn't wait for it, but he said it took 14 minutes, or something, to come up with a conclusion. And it said, The President tested negative for CVOID-19. So that s the second one. I think I took it, really, out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked, and it s a lot easier.
I ve done them both. And the second one is much more pleasant, Jeff, I can tell you that. Much more pleasant. So I'll be back in a little while. And, Mike, please take over. Thank you. Thank you all very much. I ll be right back.
Sure.
Yeah. Sure. Peter, go ahead.
No, you re doing a good job. Thank you.
Go ahead. Go ahead. Answer --
You go ahead.
Come here. Come here. Come.
And, by the way, we've cut them out also, to be honest. We've stopped orders going from certain places. And in a couple of places -- like, we had a big order going to Italy on important outfits and some ventilators, and it was going to Italy. They made the order a long time ago. And I said, You got to let it go. They had an order.
And I could have cut it, under the Act. I could have cut it. I said, Nope, you can't do that. You got to let it go. You know, they have big problems. We had an order going to Spain, and I said, Let it go. I could have stopped it. I said, Let it go. We're going to be fine. I said, Let it go. So it works that way also.
One other thing, as to your question: Oftentimes -- and we've told this to the governors -- Mike, we've been very strong on this -- have -- if you think there's bidding between federal government and state, let us know and we'll drop out immediately, or you drop out and we lower the price.
No, no. If we re bidding against each other, I said find out who it is. And usually, they know. Everyone knows. And we re notified and we get notified, and we ll either drop out or they ll drop out. But we have another problem: There are 151 countries out there, beyond the states. There are 151 countries that have this problem.
And they re ordering too. It s really a mess. Now, in a little while, the hardest thing to get are the ventilators because they re -- you know, it takes a while to build them. And we have a lot. We have thousands of them being built right now. In a little while, they ll be worth about five dollars. But right now, they re very valuable.
And we re going to have a lot of them being shipped. And, in fact, that s why General Motors called up before -- Mary. That s why others called up two days ago. They called up that they re all in production. And they ll start -- they re starting to arrive in a week and a half. But there ll be a time when we re going to build stockpiles.
By the way, the states should have been building their stockpile. We have almost 10,000 in our stockpile. And we've been building it, and we've been supplying it. But the states should be building. We're a backup. We're not an ordering clerk. We're a backup. And we've done an unbelievable job. Like, for instance, who ever heard of a governor calling up, Sir, can you build us a hospital of 2,500 rooms?
And we built it. Can you build us four medical centers? We built it. Can you deliver a ship -- a hospital ship -- with 1,000 rooms? And we did it. And we did it in Los Angeles, too. We've been an unbelievable -- we ve done an unbelievable job -- these people. And so -- and thousands of people behind them.
But we're a backup. Ideally, those hospitals would have had all this equipment. Ideally, those states should have had all this equipment, and I think they will the next time. You know, you heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago. And a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it's big money.
You're talking about -- I think it was a billion dollars. But you're talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen. Because normally, on a ventilator -- other than a pandemic or an epidemic -- you wouldn't -- you wouldn't need anything like this. Hospitals have three ventilators -- big hospitals -- and they get by with it. And now they want thousands.
I mean, they want thousands of ventilators. You call up a governor and he'll say, Sir, could you send us 40,000 ventilators? Nobody has ever heard of a thing like this. So, they've done some job. Let me just tell you, when Secretary Mnuchin spoke, they want you to call not .com but SBA.gov -- okay? -- for the application and for information.
Okay? So it's SBA -- small business -- SBA.gov, okay? If you don't mind. Yeah, let's go. Please.
Right.
Well, we re -- we re doing better than that.
Yeah. No, I understand the question. And we're doing better than that. We're going to try and get a cash payment to the people. And we're working out the mechanics of that with legislature. So we're going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn't help as much. So we're going to work it out.
So we're going to try and get for that certain group of people -- it's a certain group of people -- a cash payment. Go ahead.
Well, they have that, and they have to work that out. What they should do is they should have -- long before this pandemic arrived, they should have been on the open market just buying. There was no competition. You could have made a great price. The states have to stock up. It's like one of those things.
They waited. They didn't want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen. And their shelves, in some cases, were bare. And, by the way, in some cases they weren't. They were beautifully serviced. They did a good job. But in some cases, their shelves were bare. So the best thing they can do is when times become normalized -- and they will, hopefully soon -- and actually, you're going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in terms of protective gear, protective outfits.
A lot is being done. It's going to be -- within six months, it s going to be sold for the right price. They got to stack up for the next time. But we are doing that. And the Admiral has done a fantastic job. Senator Schumer wrote a letter today and he says, You should put a military man in charge. I said, Well, Chuck, if you knew a little bit more, we have one of the most highly respected people in the military: the Admiral.
This is what he does too, very professionally. And he s in charge. But Chuck didn t know that. Okay. Jeff, please.
Yeah.
I don't know what they're agreeing to. I think they might agree to more than that. Look, Russia -- Russia --
Yeah. He did say that actually. Russia talked about 10 million barrels. Russia and Saudi Arabia are fighting over this. And as everybody knows, it's, you know, really killing an industry; hurting Russia badly, hurting Saudi Arabia badly. I said, This is an easy one. It should be an easy one. And it may be 10 and it may be more than that.
I was actually told it may be 10. As I told somebody before, it may be 10, and it may be more than that. Maybe it's 15. Maybe it goes up to 15. Could be as high as 15. And, you know, there's a tremendous oversupply right now. That industry was -- it was over-supplied before the virus. And when the virus came along, they lost 35, 40 percent of the world.
And there s an unbelievable -- you can't get a ship now. Every ship is loaded to the gills, sitting out someplace in the ocean. They re storage tanks. They re not even ships; they re storage tanks. So it would be great for Russia, it would be great for Saudi Arabia. I hope they make that deal, but that's what they told me they said --
-- they said it's --
Well, I think it will be hopefully soon. I think hopefully they ll announce something soon. Now, can a deal be broken? Can something happen where it doesn t happen? I guess. In which case there s another alternative. But I d rather not see that other alternative. I hope they can make a deal.
They both want -- I think they both want to make a deal. And they're both smart. They love their countries. They want to make a deal. It's good, but it's also good for the world if they do because you save an industry.
Yeah, please. Go ahead. Go ahead, in the back, please.
I'm going to let Mike, because we went over this very specifically. And I'll let you talk about it, Mike, because you responded last time.
Go ahead.
No, but I talked to him about it. And he wants to do what's right for the people of Florida. He's been a great governor. You could see that just by his popularity, which is extraordinary. We're proud of him. He's done a fantastic job and he made the decision. But we spoke before he made the decision, yes.
That I haven t heard. No, that I haven t heard.
I haven't heard that. Yes, please.
Well, I think they're going to be coming out with regulations on that. And if people want to abide by them, frankly, I don't think you -- I don't think there'll be mandatory, because some people don't want to do that. But if people wanted -- as an example, on the masks, if people wanted to wear them, they can.
If people wanted to use scarves, which they have -- many people have them -- they can. In many cases, the scarf is better; it's thicker. I mean you can -- if you -- depending on the material, it's thicker. But they can do that if they want. Now, a recommendation is coming out. We'll see what that recommendation is, but --
But I will say this, they can pretty much decide for themselves right now.
Nationwide.
Yeah.
Sure.
All right, maybe I will ask --
-- Dr. Birx. And you might mention that other point also. Yeah, thanks.
Good.
Go ahead.
They are being made.
They re moving very quickly -- it s happening -- in this case.
No, No. We didn t discuss that. They want to do that, that's good for their countries, and we did not discuss that now.
Oh, I don t think so at all. But we're going to wait a little while because I understand there s a news conference by the Secretary of Defense about that. But, you know, I don't -- I don't agree with that at all. Not at all. Not even a little bit. Yeah.
Well, they have experts. And, frankly, long after, we came out and talked about it -- look, how would I have known to cut off China? I cut off China very early. And if I didn't, we would have a chart that you wouldn't believe. So how would I know to do that? How would I know to cut off Europe? I cut off Europe very early.
I mean, you have to make a decision. People knew that some bad things were going on, and they got off to a late start. And some others got off to a late start also. But we cut off China. If we didn't cut off China, we would have been in some big trouble. And we cut it off.
And you know what? We cut it off way early. Go ahead.
Too bad.
Who are you with? Who are you with?
Right. Right.
So, we haven't discussed it, but we're talking to them. You know, getting them not to pay copays, in the case of the big ones, was a tremendous thing. That's a lot of money they gave up. But we're discussing that with the insurance companies.
We ll let you know. It'll be pretty quickly. Yeah, go ahead.
Well, we're looking at a lot of things and a lot of different bans. We have more bans than anybody. We had bans when bans weren't fashionable if you remember, right at the beginning of this administration; it was for different reasons. But we've had bans long before people thought of bans. When I did China, it had never been done before.
I was the first one to do it. Remember that. It had never -- according to what I read in all the papers, this had never been done. This is a terrible thing to do. And four weeks later, they were all saying, We're lucky we did it. So we're looking at it. No, we heard that. And I think it's fine that they do that.
They're trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country. Yeah, please.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He s a good governor, Brian Kemp. He's a very good -
He s a good governor and he has to make his own decision on that. I let the states -- I think we're about 85 percent positive on that, if you look. I think it's about 85 percent of the states have got the stay-at-home. Brian is a great governor. We ll -- it's his decision. He made that decision. Ultimately, he decided to go along with it.
And they're doing -- and they're doing well. And the state is doing well, in many respects. Yeah, go ahead, please.
We're accepting it. It was a very nice offer from President Putin. I spoke to him the other night, as I told you. And they had excess medical equipment, things. And I'll take it. I'll take it.
I think it's very nice. We've had some from China. We also help other countries. We like doing that. Like I said before, if we have excess stuff, we let it go out. We let some go out where, frankly, they had orders for it and I didn't want to stop orders. It was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin.
And I could ve said, No, thank you, or I could have said, Thank you. And it was a large plane of very high-quality medical supplies. And I said, I'll take it.
I think he would, if we asked for it. But he was very nice. It was part of the call. He suggested -- he said, We have it. It's additional. They have very big difficulties with this virus also, as you know -- Russia. I thought it was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin. I could have said, No, I don't want it, or I could have said, I'll take it. And you know what I said?
I'll take it.
I think so, yeah. If they sent things that we need, I d take it. Sure. Nice gesture.
I m not concerned about Russian propaganda, not even a little bit. He offered a lot of medical high-quality stuff that I accepted. And that may save a lot of lives. I'll take it every day. Please, in the back.
Oh, they re very hard hit. They re very hard hit.
In a lot of ways, they re hard hit. They re hit in -- with their economy, with their military, and with, obviously, the virus. They re very hard hit.
Well, they haven t even asked us to do that, okay?
You know what? They haven t even asked us to do that.
If they want to meet, we d love to meet and we d love to settle the whole thing out. But I doubt they ll be --
I think they love America. I think the Iranians love America. I think they d love to be free. I think they d love to have just some of the things that we have. You know, I remember Iran, many years ago -- friends of mine were always in Iran. They were doing real estate deals in Iran. They were building beautiful buildings all over Iran.
Apartment houses. It was -- they were very successful. And then, one day, that came to an end. But you know what? The people of Iran, they remember that. It was a long time ago, but not so long ago. And they remember it. And I ll tell you, they love America. They love what we stand for. And we re not looking for cha- -- we re not looking for government takeover, government change.
You know, this country has been through that many times. That doesn t work.
Well, what I did -- yeah. What I did, as you know --
-- I put it out very publicly, with respect to Iran. I said if they need help with respect to the virus, we'd love to send -- we have the greatest medical professionals in the world. We d love to send them over.
I m not encouraging or discouraging. They ve been a very hostile country. They made a deal that President Obama should have never made. It was a short-term deal giving them $150 billion, giving them $1.8 billion in cash. Green. Fill up this room five times. Look --
No. Not at all. Nobody has even asked me about it. I have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask. If they -- if they needed help, I would certainly consider different things.
Well, that s up to the United Nations. I m talking about us. And what happens is, if they wanted help -- because they have a very big case of virus. A very, very big case. It -- one of the worst on Earth, if you believe what you re reading. And I happen to believe what I see and what I know. And if they wanted help, we d give them help.
Yeah. You had one, in the back, please.
Go ahead.
Or they don t exist.
Or the sources don t exist. They re fake persons, okay? A lot of fake sources out there. They don t exist. I read about it -- for a long time, I ve been reading. A lot of them -- fakes sources. They don t exist. Go ahead. Please.
But, Deborah, aren t you referring to just a few states? Because many of those states are dead flat. I mean, so --
So, it s hard to get -- it s hard to be --
Again, so I look at the graphs all the time.
And you have many, many --
-- flatliners. I call them flatliners. I m amazed at them. And you have a couple that are up. It s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job.
No, because I saw those pens going five minutes ago. They were so -- they were thrilled. And the fact is -- yes, we compare them to Italy. One place. But we have many places that are --
-- really doing great. And I think that's what Deborah meant. She didn t mean all of them. So when you write your story tomorrow, maybe you ll write it correctly. She was talking about one state. And another state is, you know, having a hard time. It s -- and they re closely associated. And, by the way, the people are doing a very good job, including the people that live there.
But when Deborah was talking about Italy, she was talking about the one, and then the other was lower. And then you have mostly states that have been unbelievable. So she wasn t talking about the average of everything; she was talking about an individual state, which is, I think, still better than Italy.
Italy is having a hard time. By the way, Spain is having a hard time. France is having a hard time. But our states, generally speaking, it's like lots of different countries all over. We have -- many of those countries are doing a phenomenal job. They're really flat. And I think that's what you meant.
I don't know. I don't want to -- I don't want to speak for -- but I thought -- that's what I understood she meant. Yeah, please.
Because some states, they stay in better. They re not touching. They re not -- whatever it is. They re not going out. They re not in groups. And some states are not probably as good, or for whatever reason. Or they also live a lot closer. You know, New York is very dense. And, you know, California is pretty dense too.
And they ve got a very good record going so far. We hope it doesn t spike up, but it s very flat. We have states that are doing incredibly well. I mean, when I looked at some of them, I looked at some states that I would have thought maybe wouldn t have done as well, and they re really flatlined. Hope they stay that way.
I hope they stay that way.
Say it, Jeff.
I want them -- yeah, that s what I m saying.
No, no, no. But when Deborah mentioned about Italy and our country, she wasn t referring to our country; she was referring to one state.
Okay. So my understanding -- I m going to let her say it. But I think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most states are doing. Thrilled.
The flat-line -- the flat-line states -- states that have almost no bump. I mean, I would think. Now, then you have others where, for whatever reason, they're higher. That's different. But you can't condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there's the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to Italy, where they have some very unique problems.
In all fairness to Italy, they have some very unique problems. But if you'd like to come up and --
A lot of them.
Yeah. That s exactly --
I think that's perfect.
So I just want to say -- look, many states have started low and slow, and then they stayed at a good level. Some really stayed at a great level. Some -- Louisiana, as an example: It was low and slow and they were looking great. I was watching it because, you know, it's kind of a place people go to with Mardi Gras -- which, sort of, is an interesting point, because after Mardi Gras, it was low, and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly.
And now it's one of our true hotspots, right? Certain areas of Michigan -- Detroit was -- it looked like it was doing pretty good, and then all of a sudden it went up. So you have that too. But I'll tell you what: We have states that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so -- so low.
They have not -- you haven't seen the bump, and I hope you don't. I hope you don't. And you have a couple that, for a lot of different reasons -- and that's not to blame anybody, but they are at a higher level. But very few. I think, Deborah -- I mean, I may say: I think most people have actually followed the presidential -- you can call them whatever you want.
I would never use the word ""dictates"" because if I used that word, I would be in such trouble. In fact, you ll put me in trouble just that I even mentioned the thought of it. Okay? But we make a recommendation. And I think they've done a good job, and maybe they started a little later, but maybe they're also more difficult states.
But we've done, I think, on average, really phenomenally as a country. I think we've done phenomenally. Because when you looked at that graph the other day -- I don't know if you saw it; I assume you saw it. Everybody in the world saw it. But you look at all those lines on the bottom -- one color after another, all different, representing different states -- it's all crowded at the bottom.
And then you had two that were up. But you had -- I don't know, almost every one of them was down low. Very low. So there were a lot of people listening. And I just did -- I want to be clear because I don't need headlines tomorrow, and neither does the country, because I don't want this country working so hard and then have press that is, in this case, maybe misinterpret something.
Because I might have -- I might have -- when I heard it, I was surprised at first too, but I understood what Deborah meant.
But I think it's very important -- because I think it's very important for you to be accurate. One other thing. Just a quick thing. So, what I found is when governors call me -- I mean, I think in every case, they've always been so nice. So nice. And I've seen them and heard them say, ""Thank you very much.
You have done a great job."" ""A fantastic job,"" in one case. ""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."" Then I'll see the governor, usually of the opposite party. In almost all cases, except maybe one -- but in almost all cases, they're very generous, they're very nice. They thank me. Everything is great. We're doing a great job.
And then I'll see them on television, and just like a different person. And I realized there are some people, because of politics, that if they say, We want 1,000 ventilators, and I'll say, ""No, Jim, I want to give you 5,000 ventilators,"" they'll say, ""Thank you. You are the greatest President that's ever lived."" And then, I'll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show, and they'll say, ""The President didn't come through for me. I'm very disappointed in the President."" And we have a lot of that.
They're very happy when they talk to me, and then I see them. But there are some people, if they asked for 500 of something, and if I gave them 5,000, they will say -- you'll say, ""How's the President doing?"" ""Well, we don't like the job."" To my face, they're very nice, but then sometimes -- I guess, they assume I don't watch them or something, but I watch very closely.
Yeah, please.
Well, it's vulnerable in that it's close together, really. I -- I can't tell you about age, but a lot of young people in prison. Some people -- some states -- I have not done that at all, but some states are letting people out of prison. Some people are getting out that are very serious criminals, in some states.
And I don't like that. I don't like it. But it's a city or state thing in certain cases, as you know. I think maybe Philadelphia comes to mind. So we'll see. You have to see what what's going on. And we don't like it. The people don't like it. And we're looking in to see if I have the right to stop it in some cases, okay?
Oh, I think it s --
I think they re going through -- I think it s terrible. So, look, four weeks ago, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest in the world -- greatest in the history of the world. We had the most jobs ever in the history of the United States. Almost 160 million jobs, right? And then, one day, I get a call from Deborah, who s fantastic, and from Dr. Fauci.
And he said and she said, We have a problem. I said, What's the problem? And they said, We may have to close it up. I said, Close what up? They said, Close up the country. And I said, What's that all about? And we discussed today -- and probably not since 1917; we came to that conclusion -- and she is a fantastic person, a brilliant person, and this is what she knows.
I said, Has it ever been this bad? And I think I can represent that you said no. And part of it -- it's a contagion. It's so contagious. It's like, if you sneeze, I probably get it. Whoever heard of a thing like that? Okay? And this very talented reporter is bailing out. Okay? He's out of here. I don't blame you.
But it's a very contagious thing, and -- probably the likes of which we've never seen in terms of that. But 1917 -- so that's over 100 years ago, but that was -- you know, it's been written about many, many times. That was a horrible -- whether it was 75 or 100 million people -- I've heard from 50 to 75, I've heard 75 to 100 -- but it was tens of millions of people.
Now, we have the advantage of communication. This could have been just as bad. I mean, here we can read on the Internet. We can see what to do. We can have these meetings; they can watch on television, which they do. A lot of people are watching. A lot of people are watching. And they say, Gee, social distancing.
But in 1917, they didn't have that option. You know, they didn't know what to do. They just noticed people were dying all over the place. Think of it: 75- to 100 million people died. A lot of people in this country died. I always -- to me, it's a great -- it's a great question: How come more people didn't die in this country?
And they say it actually started in this country and went to Europe. I mean, we lost a lot of people, but relatively, we lost very few compared to Europe. So this is a terrible thing that happened. And what's happening now, with people and jobs -- so think of the position I'm in. We have built all together, everybody -- not me, everybody -- the greatest economy in history.
And all of a sudden, people come in that we respect and we know. And here's the thing: They were right. Everybody questioned it for a while. Not everybody, but a good portion questioned it. They said, Let's keep it open. Let's ride it. If we did that -- you saw the other graph. And whether it's true or almost true or maybe not true enough -- the number was 2.2 million people would have died.
2.2 million people would have died in a short period of time. In fact, the graph could have been even shorter. I always noticed that that horrible one -- where it goes high -- it actually comes down a little bit faster. It might have been over faster and you would have lost 2.2 million people. So they come in and they say, We have to close up the country.
And I say, You know what that does to this -- to the fabric of this country, to people that had great jobs, great family, no problems with money. They never even thought of it. And then you see 6 million people unemployed.
Unemployment numbers get released and you see 6 million people. And it's an artificial closing. It's not like we have a massive recession or worse. It's artificial because we turned it off. Think of all we're doing. We're saying, Don't go to work and we'll pay you. Everything is the opposite. It was always, Go to work and make a lot of money and do well, and -- the American Dream.
Because of a hidden enemy, we re saying, Don't go to work and we're going to pay you. Look at the money: $2 trillion. And we will probably do more. I think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do. You want to get the restaurants back? You give deductibility. You understand what that is. You give deductibility for businesses where they go and they use the restaurants.
The restaurants will be bigger and better than they were before. You know, people don't know: A lot of restaurants closed when they ended deductibility. And then they started doing well, but they had fewer restaurants. But the boom of the restaurants is when they had deductibility, where corporations could use them.
So -- and entertainment. That was a great thing. But they closed it, and then they closed it again. And it wasn't the same. But if you want to get them back, you do that. But infrastructure: We borrow our money now at zero. You know, if were paying 5 percent, 4 percent, 3 percent, it's a different ballgame.
We re borrowing -- we can borrow long term for zero -- literally zero; you know that -- because we're considered the safe investment. All over the world, they want money in the United States. That's where they want the money. So I know better than anybody. I just -- I know what they're going through, and it's horrible.
But you know what I want to do? I want to be able to get them back fast. When this is over, it's going to be a day we're going to celebrate, because everyone is going to go to work and I think we're going to have boom times. I think it's going to be great. And we've learned a lot. We've learned about borders.
We've learned about reliance on other countries. We've learned so much -- so much that I think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger. And I think it's going to come back very quickly, but first we have to defeat this enemy. So we will see you tomorrow. Thank you very much. Thank you.
",Press Conference: Donald Trump Holds the Daily Coronavirus Pandemic Briefing,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-coronavirus-briefing-april-2-2020
Barack Obama,United States of America,2016-04-30,"Good evening, everybody.
It is an honor to be here at my last -- and perhaps the last -- White House Correspondents' Dinner.
You all look great.
The end of the Republic has never looked better!
I do apologize. I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on ""CPT"" -- which stands for ""Jokes That White People Should Not Make
That's right.
My brilliant and beautiful wife, Michelle, is here tonight.
She looks so happy to be here. That's called practice -- it's like learning to do three-minute planks. She makes it look easy now.
Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot, and it's anyone's guess who she will be. But standing here, I can't help but be reflective, a little sentimental. Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific.
Eight years ago, I was a young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look at me now. I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the days 'til my death panel. Hillary once questioned whether I'd be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call -- now I'm awake anyway because I've got to go to the bathroom. I'm up.
And I said, ""Justin, just give it a rest."" I resented that.
Meanwhile, Michelle has not aged a day. The only way you can date her in photos is by looking at me.
Take a look.
Here we are in 2008.
Here we are a few years later.
And this one is from two weeks ago.
So time passes. In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat-out reject my authority. And Republican leaders won't take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used to, it's really going to -- it's a curve ball. I don't know what to do with it.
Of course, in fact, for months now congressional Republicans have been saying there are things I cannot do in my final year. Unfortunately, this dinner was not one of them. But on everything else, it's another story. And you know who you are, Republicans. In fact, I think we've got Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner, they're in the house, which reminds me -- Security, bar the doors! Judge Merrick Garland, come on out,we're going to do this right here, right now. It's like ""The Red Wedding.""
But it's not just Congress. Even some foreign leaders, they've been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe.
That was a slap in the face. A clear breach in protocol. Although while in England I did have lunch with Her Majesty, the Queen, took in a performance of Shakespeare, hit the links with David Cameron.
I won't lie -- look, this is a tough transition. It's hard. Key staff are now starting to leave the White House.
Savannah Guthrie, she's left the White House Press Corps to host the Today show.
Norah O'Donnell left the briefing room to host CBS This Morning.
Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN.
But the prospect of leaving the White House is a mixed bag. You might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give Secret Service credit -- they found Michelle, brought her back; she's safe back at home now. It's only nine more months, baby. Settle down.
And yet, somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major.
Puzzling....
Anyway, in this last year I do have more appreciation for those who have been with me on this amazing ride, like one of our finest public servants, Joe Biden. God bless him. Love that guy. I love Joe Biden -- I really do. And I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face. Thank you, Joe.
Also, I would be remiss -- let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore. You're the South African guy, right? I love Larry. And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which is a great town.
I also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight. Rachel McAdams. Mark Ruffalo. Liev Schreiber. Thank you all for everything that you've done. I'm just joking. As you know, Spotlight is a film, a movie about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since Star Wars. Look -- that was maybe a cheap shot.
I understand the news business is tough these days, it keeps changing all the time. Every year at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about BuzzFeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year, the Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard. Kind of a silence there. Especially at the Washington Post table.
GOP Chairman Reince Priebus is here as well. Glad to see you that you feel that you've earned a night off. Congratulations on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process -– it's all going great. Keep it up.
Kendall Jenner is also here. And we had a chance to meet her backstage -- she seems like a very nice young woman. I'm not exactly sure what she does, but I am told that my Twitter mentions are about to go through the roof.
Helen Mirren is here tonight. I don't even have a joke here. I just think Helen Mirren is awesome. She's awesome.
Sitting at the same table, I see Mike Bloomberg. Mike, a combative, controversial New York billionaire is leading the GOP primary and it is not you. That's has to sting a little bit. Although it's not an entirely fair comparison between you and The Donald. After all, Mike was a big-city mayor. He knows policy in depth. And he's actually worth the amount of money that he says he is.
What an election season. For example, we've got the bright new face of the Democratic Party here tonight –- Mr. Bernie Sanders! There he is -- Bernie! Bernie, you look like a million bucks. Or to put it in terms you'll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of 27 dollars each.
A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially his appeal to young people. But not me, I get it. Just recently, a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man this year. That was not going to happen. Bernie might have let her go. Not us.
I am hurt, though, Bernie, that you've distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that's just not something that you do to your comrade.
Bernie's slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people. ""Feel the Bern."" Feel the Bern -- it's a good slogan.
Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this.
Meanwhile, some candidates aren't polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight.
The rules were well-established ahead of time.
And then there's Ted Cruz. Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana –- Hoosier country –- stood on a basketball court, and called the hoop a ""basketball ring."" What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But sure, I'm the foreign one.
Well, let me conclude tonight on a more serious note. I want to thank the Washington press corps, I want to thank Carol for all that you do. The free press is central to our democracy, and -- nah, I'm just kidding! You know I've got to talk about Trump! Come on! We weren't just going to stop there. Come on.
Although I am a little hurt that he's not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising. You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no? Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump Steak -- tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What's he doing?
And there's one area where Donald's experience could be invaluable -– and that's closing Guantanamo. Because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.
All right, that's probably enough. I mean, I've got more material -- no, no, I don't want to spend too much time on The Donald. Following your lead, I want to show some restraint. Because I think we can all agree that from the start, he's gotten the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy.
I hope you all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost, and now we're praying that Cleveland makes it through July.
Mm-mm-mm. Hmm. 
As for me and Michelle, we've decided to stay in D.C. for a couple more years. Thank you. This way, our youngest daughter can finish up high school, Michelle can stay closer to her plot of carrots. She's already making plans to see them every day. Take a look.
But our decision has actually presented a bit of a dilemma because, traditionally, Presidents don't stick around after they're done. And it's something that I've been brooding about a little bit. Take a look.
I am still waiting for all of you to respond to my invitation to connect on LinkedIn. But I know you have jobs to do, which is what really brings us here tonight.
I know that there are times that we've had differences, and that's inherent in our institutional roles -- it's true of every President and his press corps. But we've always shared the same goal -- to root our public discourse in the truth; to open the doors of this democracy; to do whatever we can to make our country and our world more free and more just. And I've always appreciated the role that you have all played as equal partners in reaching these goals.
And our free press is why we once again recognize the real journalists who uncovered a horrifying scandal and brought about some measure of justice for thousands of victims throughout the world. They are here with us tonight –- Sacha Pfeiffer, Mike Rezendes, Walter Robinson, Matt Carroll, andBen Bradlee, Jr. Please give them a big round of applause.
Our free press is why, once again, we honor Jason Rezaian. As Carol noted, last time this year, we spoke of Jason's courage as he endured the isolation of an Iranian prison. This year, we see that courage in the flesh and it's a living testament to the very idea of a free press, and a reminder of the rising level of danger, and political intimidation, and physical threats faced by reporters overseas. And I can make this commitment that as long as I hold this office, my Administration will continue to fight for the release of American journalists held against their will -- and we will not stop until they see the same freedom as Jason had.
At home and abroad, journalists like all of you engage in the dogged pursuit of informing citizens, and holding leaders accountable, and making our government of the people possible. And it's an enormous responsibility. And I realize it's an enormous challenge at a time when the economics of the business sometimes incentivize speed over depth; and when controversy and conflict are what most immediately attract readers and viewers.
The good news is there are so many of you that are pushing against those trends. And as a citizen of this great democracy, I am grateful for that. For this is also a time around the world when some of the fundamental ideals of liberal democracies are under attack, and when notions of objectivity, and of a free press, and of facts, and of evidence are trying to be undermined. Or, in some cases, ignored entirely.
And in such a climate, it's not enough just to give people a megaphone. And that's why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question and to counter distortions and untruths is more important than ever. Taking a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding your objectivity. In fact, it is the essence of good journalism. It affirms the idea that the only way we can build consensus, the only way that we can move forward as a country, the only way we can help the world mend itself is by agreeing on a baseline of facts when it comes to the challenges that confront us all.
So this night is a testament to all of you who have devoted your lives to that idea, who push to shine a light on the truth every single day. So I want to close my final White House Correspondents' Dinner by just saying thank you. I'm very proud of what you've done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy.
And with that, I just have two more words to say -– 
Obama out.

Jacqui Smith,United Kingdom,2015-12-03,"I am very glad to be able to speak at the conference today. I very much welcome the themes of the conference, to examine policy and practice in tackling organised crime, by bringing together UK and EU experience.
Whilst organised crime may operate at national and international level, its effects are felt in every community. I say that because organised crime does not exist in some sort of vacuum. It fuels all manner of criminal and anti-social behaviour in our communities. We all know the blight and dangers which drug dealing and using brings to our streets. But it is important to remember that organised criminals also deal in cheap alcohol, tobacco and, shockingly, in people as well. The violence of the organised crime groups themselves, the misery inflicted on individual victims and the damage to our communities make this a phenomenon that we must tackle.
Reduced to financial terms we estimate that the economic and social costs in the UK are in excess of £20bn. They manifest themselves in various ways but most notably in the form of drug related crime. That is a huge sum but in itself does not illustrate what is happening in our communities as a result. It is protecting those communities in which I am interested. An effective response to organised crime is part of that.
In the UK in recent years we have gone to great lengths to make the country a more difficult place for organised criminals to operate. Government has carried through legislative change and reformed the organisations we task to tackle organised crime. But success can only be achieved through a strong partnership.
In particular, a partnership approach between Government and law enforcement. We set overall strategic priorities, while law enforcement drive the effort at the front end. But there are other partners as well. And, as today’s conference makes clear whilst impact is local, influence needs to be international if we’re to achieve real results. Legislation
Firstly, I’d like to outline some of the changes in legislation that we’ve introduced. Like many other countries, we have introduced legislation on proceeds of crime and money laundering. Organised criminals are out to make money and do not like losing it. We need to do all we can to identify dirty money which gets into the legitimate financial system; and to confiscate criminally derived assets. Asset recovery prevents and deters future crime, raises the cost of crime, and allows some payback to victims and society. We regard it as a necessary and powerful instrument for tackling organised criminals.
In addition the law enforcement authorities in the UK now benefit from a wider range of tools to do their job.
Over the last couple of years we have,
-Put the giving of Queen’s Evidence on a statutory footing so that offenders assisting investigations and prosecutions can benefit from lesser sentences if they testify against their criminal associates
-Made provision in certain circumstances for persons to be required to answer questions, provide information or produce documents for the investigation
-Introduced Financial Reporting Orders where a convicted person can be required to report on his financial affairs for a number of years, up to a maximum of twenty.
-And created Serious Crime Prevention Orders which will allow prohibitions or restrictions to be put on the activities of a person involved in serious crime. The aim will be to prevent them committing further crime, for example by limiting communication or association with other people.
These last two measures are very much aimed at life-time offender management. For the most serious career organised criminals we believe that it is necessary to fetter and disrupt their activities over a period of time. It is insufficient, for example, when they have completed a prison sentence simply to let them carry on as they have before, and as they wish. Organisations
I would like to turn now to the organisational changes we have made for tackling organised crime.
It started business in April 2006 and was set up to tackle organised crime in a rather different way from its predecessors. Instead of asking the agency to work exclusively on preventing and detecting serious organised crime we have also asked it to consider how it can contribute to the reduction of such crime in other ways and to reduce the harms it causes.
We have also asked the organisation to pay more attention to understanding organised crime. That is, improving the intelligence picture so that organised crime is tackled through an approach which prioritises networks and markets doing the most harm.
Underpinning that approach is the UK Threat Assessment which describes the threat and the National Intelligence Requirement which aims in a systematic way to fill intelligence gaps.
I welcome the way that SOCA has gone about its tasks so far. The Government and they recognise that tackling organised crime is not a job for them alone. They have developed a control strategy comprising a number of programmes of activity which are truly collaborative.
Those programmes comprise representatives from all the relevant agencies – for example, police forces, HM Revenue and Customs and the Prison Service. It is only by bringing together all those with an interest into coherent programmes that real progress can be made. I very much support that approach.
SOCA, working with partners, can already point to significant successes. Last year it was involved in seizures of 74 tonnes of Class A drugs and 1,700 arrests made in the UK and around the world. Those are good results in an organisation in its early days. I am looking forward to more.
This year, we will merge the Asset Recovery Agency into SOCA. Bringing together the financial investigative skills, expertise and experience of both organisations will ensure the most effective investigative tools and techniques can be used against criminals. It fits with the priority of disrupting organised crime finance and SOCA’s responsibility for reducing harm.
This year also sees the creation of the UK Border Agency through an amalgamation of the Border and Immigration Agency and part of HM Revenue and Customs. An agency with a strong remit to control the movement of people and freight will strengthen our ability to tackle the international aspects of organised crime.
I would not, though, want to imply that the law enforcement authorities should provide the sole response to organised crime. They have to be helped in their tasks.
Private bodies can, and do, provide support and co-operation in the prevention, detection and prosecution of organised crime. For example, financial service providers report suspicions transactions and communication service providers retain and disclose data which help investigations. These are all very important. They need to be encouraged and the doors kept open for sharing data and information in appropriate circumstances.
I know this is an area of work in which SOCA is investing a good deal of time and effort. Gun Crime
We need to be able to respond to particular challenges with new ways of working and new partnerships. In recent years, for example, we have seen firearms being used by younger people, in a sometimes chaotic environment. Not, in itself organised crime, but clearly supported and facilitated by trade in guns and often linked to gang membership.
Sadly, Liverpool has been among the cities to be affected and you will all be aware of the recent tragic murder of Rhys Jones.
In September, I set up the Tackling Gangs Action Programme to develop multi-agency work in neighbourhoods in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool where the majority of firearms offences occur. One strand of the work focuses on the supply of firearms. We know that firearms come into the UK from other EU member states, some of which may be through organised criminal gangs. The Serious Organised Crime Agency and HM Revenue and Customs have raised the priority of this issue and are working with police and colleagues across the EU to gather intelligence and choke off this supply. Last year SOCA were involved in recovering more than 150 firearms; and a co-ordinated day of action on 28 November last year in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London resulted in the seizure of 10 firearms and over 1,000 realistic imitations.
We are also focusing on enforcement – ensuring that those committing these offences are brought to justice – enhancing support and protection for witnesses, as well as a range of prevention activity to make sure young people are able to achieve their potential and do not become involved in criminal and gang activity. In the EU context
So far I have spoken very much about what we have been doing in the UK. But when dealing with organised crime it is essential to think internationally too. And in doing that we need, and wish, to work closely with the EU and other Member States.
The key argument about that, however, is not the minutiae of European institutions, but the way in which we can use European cooperation to really impact on our crime fighting efforts. I would like to mention some areas where we believe that the EU has added real value.
The European Arrest Warrant has proved itself to be an efficient and effective mechanism for returning those seeking to evade justice by going abroad. Extradition times have been reduced by months, if not years, and the UK can point to examples of the successful execution of European Arrest Warrants bringing fugitives back to the UK or returning them to the country in which they are wanted. We regard it as a real success.
We are hopeful that when the European Evidence Warrant is adopted comparable benefits will accrue in speeding up the provision of evidence.
Its importance to us derives from its ability to facilitate information exchange, its analytical support capability and its role in supporting Member State law enforcement authorities in their fight against cross border crime. The United Kingdom is strongly committed to Europol, whose assistance has been invaluable in a number of successful police investigations in the UK involving gangs operating across the European Union. It also produces the EU Organised Crime Threat Assessment which we regard as an essential underpinning document – you need to have a knowledge of what your problems are before you can make sensible decisions about tackling them.
A good example of an operation which we undertook with Europol involved an armed and violent gang committing twenty armed robberies against jewellers in the UK. They had also committed 200 similar crimes across the EU. As a result of that co-operation prosecutions have been brought in eleven cases.
Eurojust too provides an important mechanism for facilitating information exchange and co-ordinating investigations and prosecutions between EU Member States. In 2007 the UK sought assistance through Eurojust in more cases than any other Member State and received the second most number of requests for assistance.
In one operation Eurojust co-ordinated actions across five countries, including the UK, leading to the arrest of 82 people for human trafficking offences. The benefits are clear.
The EU is also taking forward a number of initiatives to improve data sharing including, for example, speeding up the process for law enforcement authorities to check unidentified fingerprint or DNA data against records held in other Member States. The ability to share information between Member States and with Third Countries for the purpose of tackling organised crime is essential. We need to be sure we do not unwittingly limit our ability to do so.
As well as these formal EU mechanisms there are other means by which Member States can pull together to tackle problems of joint interest.
The Centre, based in Lisbon combines the efforts of seven Member States. Intelligence is shared between the participating countries and each state makes available interdiction assets for co-ordinated operational action. The results of the collaboration have been very successful with many tonnes of cocaine which was being shipped to Europe being stopped. It is a good example of how well planned and executed cooperative exercises can bring real added value. Beyond the EU
Collaborative working within the EU is obviously important but the fact of the matter is that many of our organised crime problems have their origins beyond the EU’s borders.
There is a need to work closely with those countries which affect us at governmental and law enforcement agency levels.
The UK has a number of countries which it regards as priorities and works closely with. That work ranges across a wide number of fronts – securing the commitment of the politicians, providing training and other assistance to law enforcement authorities, and mounting joint operations with them.
SOCA for its part has 140 liaison officers in some 40 priority countries around the world forging close and effective relationships with the authorities of the host nations. This is an approach which the Government very much supports. It is not enough to counter problems as they reach our shores – they need to be tackled close to source as well.
I welcome the partnership brought together by this conference and the ambition it represents. And I wish you luck – not just in your discussions over the coming days, but in building stronger alliances, better understanding and more effective action. Whether it is the scourge of modern day slavery through trafficking, the lives wasted and ruined through illegal drug use or the tragedies caused by guns in the wrong hands, the thread of serious and organised crime runs throughout. It is only through ensuring that our law provides the best tools, our law enforcement organisations are at their most effective and our partnerships are strong that we can meet the threat and tackle the impact on our communities.
Good luck with that task.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2015-09-03,"Thank you, Hugh.
Okay, fine.
Yes, but go ahead, give me a little, go ahead, tell me.
Yes, okay, right.
The Kurds, by the way, have been horribly mistreated by ...
Yes, yes.
Right.
Oh, I thought you said Kurds, Kurds.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said Kurds, because I think the Kurds have been poorly treated by us, Hugh. Go ahead.
I think that Iran right now is in the driver's seat to do whatever they want to do. I think what's happening with Iran is, I think it's one of the, and I covered it very well. I assume you saw the news conference. I think Iran is, it's one of the great deals ever made for them.
I think it's one of the most incompetent contracts I've even seen. I'm not just talking about defense. I'm not talking about a contract with another country. I've never seen more of a one-sided deal, I think, in my life, absolutely.
Okay.
Is he the gentleman that was going back and forth with Russia and meeting with Putin? I read something, and that seems to be also where he's at.
He's going back and forth meeting with other countries, etc., etc.
Not good.
Not good for us. And what it shows is a total lack of respect, I mean, that the other countries would even be entertaining him, and they're entertaining him big league, big league.
Right.
Right. By the way, and nobody knows how easy that would be. And I mean, it would be, it would be tall, it would be powerful, we would make it very good looking. It would be as good as a wall's got to be, and people will not be climbing over that wall, believe me.
Go ahead.
No, you know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll be all gone. I knew you were going to ask me things like this, and there's no reason, because number one, I'll find, I will hopefully find General Douglas MacArthur in the pack. I will find whoever it is that I'll find, and we'll, but they're all changing, Hugh.
You know, those are like history questions. Do you know this one, do you know that one. I will tell you, I thought you used the word Kurd before. I will tell you that I think the Kurds are the most under-utilized and are being totally mistreated by us.
And nobody understands why. But as far as the individual players, of course I don't know them. I've never met them. I haven't been, you know, in a position to meet them.
If, if they're still there, which is unlikely in many cases, but if they're still there, I will know them better than I know you.
Well, you know, and unfortunately, I said I'd build it for $500 million. They were at $3 billion. And it ended up costing $6 billion, and I told them that would happen. And it was a disgrace.
Frankly, that whole U.N. situation was a disgrace. They ended up spending $5-6 billion dollars to renovate a building that I would have done for $500 million, and I told them I would have done it, and it would have been better. Now as far as what you're talking about now, I will know every detail, and I will have the right plan, not a plan like this where we're probably going backwards based on everything that I'm hearing, but we're probably going backwards, zero respect.
We have, we are not a respected country, and certainly as it relates to ISIS and what's going on, and Iran.
Well, that is a gotcha question, though. I mean, you know, when you're asking me about who's running this, this this, that's not, that is not, I will be so good at the military, your head will spin. But obviously, I'm not meeting these people. I'm not seeing these people.
Now it probably will be a lot of changes, Hugh, as you go along. They'll be, by the time we get there, which is still a pretty long period of time, you know, you start, let's say you figure out nominations, and who is going to represent the Republicans in, let's say, February, March, April, you'll start to get pretty good ideas, maybe sooner than that, actually. But that will be a whole new group of people. I think what is really important is to pick out, and this is something I'm so good at, to pick out who is going to be the best person to represent us militarily, because we have some great people, militarily.
I don't know that we're using them.
Well, it sounded like gotcha. You're asking me names that, I think it's somewhat ridiculous, but that's okay. Go ahead, let's go.
Yes, I've been to Israel once.
Of course, I will. In fact, he's a friend of mine. I did commercials for his reelection. And according to what he said, I'm the only celebrity, he's used the word celebrity, this was a while ago, that did commercials, that he asked to do commercials.
But he's a good man, and I would absolutely stand with him. But you know, we have a problem, because according to the deal, and this is hard to believe, but we're supposed to be protecting Iran against any invader. And if Israel invades, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, because if Israel invades Iran, I don't know if you know, but we have a clause in that agreement that the way I read it, it's almost like we have to go, and by the way, I can guarantee you that clause, first of all, should have never been there, maybe they had it taken out, but we didn't win anything. But do you know there's a clause in there that in theory, we're supposed to help them fight Israel?
I have, yes.
Well, I think the biggest, you know, I think it's terrible, first of all, with Egypt, and with Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia in particular, was making a billion dollars a day, one billion dollars a day. Now let's say they make half of that number because oil prices have been so depressed. But Saudi Arabia was making a half a billion dollars. It was a billion dollars a day.
Why aren't they helping us out? When they asked, and you may not like this, but I like it, because when we owe now $19, we're up to $19 trillion dollars, I certainly like it, and I like protecting...why aren't they helping us with the costs? We get virtually nothing from Saudi Arabia. Every time somebody raises a rifle in the air and points it in the direction of Saudi Arabia, or, by the way, South Korea and other places, every single time that happens, and I mean without exception, we start loading up and getting ready and sending ships and sending all sorts of things. We get nothing. And you know, maybe you'll explain why, but we get nothing.
And I don't like that.
Well, you need, I think Egypt and Israel get along, and they're starting to get along pretty well. Mubarak should have been frankly, probably, taken care of better than he was. That sent a bad signal around. But I think in terms of Israel, Egypt starts getting very important.
Maybe we don't need the oil to the same extent as we did, and pretty soon, if we allowed, if we allowed what we have, technologically, to go forward, we wouldn't need them at all. You know, we have potentially the greatest oil reserves in the world right here, and we wouldn't need them at all. You know, we used to need Saudi Arabia for oil, and that part of the world. It all started with the oil, and it sort of ends with the oil.
But now, we're at a point where we're going to be doing ten million barrels. It's very interesting. We're probably, very soon, if we allow our people to get going, we're probably not going to need them for the oil. So we don't need Saudi Arabia nearly to the extent that we needed them in the past.
I wouldn't want to tell you, because frankly, they have to, you know, somebody wrote a very good story about me recently, and they said there's a certain unpredictable, and it was actually another businessman, said there's a certain unpredictability about Trump that's great, and it's what made him a lot of money and a lot of success. You don't want to put, and you don't want to let people know what you're going to do with respect to certain things that happen. You don't want the other side to know. I don't want to give you an answer to that.
If I win, and I'm leading in every single poll, if I win, I don't want people to know exactly what I'm going to be doing.
Part of the problem with Obama, he says we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we're going to attack here, we're going to do this. Every time they capture somebody, they make a big deal out of it, and all of the other people, like for instance, they hit somebody with a drone, and they start making a big deal over the fact that they took out a mid-level accounting person, and now everybody else goes and runs, and it makes it harder. I don't want to explain, and I think it's a very bad thing. I think we do too much talking, and not enough, do you understand what I'm saying in this, Hugh?
We do too much talking. General Douglas MacArthur, I was watching as President Obama was talking about, I won't go into great detail, was talking about attacking at a certain time in a certain place, and I'm saying can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur, General Patton, they must be spinning in their graves when they hear it. So when you tell me a ship is attacked, I don't want to tell you exactly what I'm going to do. I don't want people to know my thinking on that, and I do have very spoken...thinking on it.
But I don't want people to know my thinking.
Well, I've responded very much to disasters. I've had, you know, fires in buildings, big buildings. I've had economic changes where the world crashed in the early 90s, and I came out stronger than I was before. And I didn't go bankrupt like many people they were forced into bankruptcy, and they were forced into, like, you know disasters never to be heard from again.
I came out stronger than I was before. There was an old expression in the early 90s Ð survive Ôtil '95 that I made up, and I gave. And I actually became much stronger. But I've gone through, I've watched economic problems happen.
Eight years ago, nine years ago when I was buying and everybody else was selling because they had no money and I did have a lot of money and I bought a lot of great assets. And you know, I've gone through a lot of different things, and I've come out on top always.
I do.
I'd rather not say.
I have a license to carry. I have a license, you know, I have a concealed license, I have a license to carry concealed.
Well, yeah, I think that you know, the word assault weapon, and a lot of people, there's been a lot of controversy, but I wouldn't give you exact, I am in favor, I have two sons that are members in very high standing at the NRA.
And I would ask them for a definition, but I am in favor of allowing, I'm very, very pro-2nd Amendment. And if you want to ask that, I would go to the experts. All I can tell you is that I am totally a 2nd Amendment person, and totally in favor of not doing anything. You know, an interesting thing happened.
When the two prisoners escaped in upstate New York, Hugh, people that really were very much against guns all of a sudden, they have these two prisoners, and they are someplace up there and nobody knew where, and a woman who said she used to fight with her husband all the time, she didn't want guns, all of a sudden, they felt so safe because they were sitting with guns, and they were able to protect themselves. Now nothing ever happened, and ultimately, they caught the one and they killed the other. You know the case I'm talking about three months ago.
But it was very interesting to watch this woman who was totally, and I mean absolutely totally against guns, and all of a sudden, she felt safe because they were able to have guns in the house. So it's interesting. No, I'm totally pro-2nd Amendment.
Well, my health is very good, and my father was 94. My mother was 89 when she passed away, and my father was in great shape until he was really like almost 90. My mother was in great shape almost until the end, and mentally, her capacity was 100%, so from a genetic standpoint, very good. I'm in the process of getting some documentation from doctors that have taken care of me over the years.
I've never had a major problem. I've had almost no minor problem as I knock on wood. But my health has been very good and very strong. And maybe you get to see that, because people say boy, you have a lot of energy.
You're able to do so many things. Don't forget, in addition to running a campaign where it's number one in every poll, I'm also running a business, which I'm rapidly giving over to my executives. I have a very big business, and I'm rapidly giving that over to my executives and my children.
Not that I know of, no.
Well, I think that's fine. I mean, he can feel that way, and I understand that. And he's not the only one, but I feel we need borders. I feel that we have to, the word illegal means we're a country of laws.
You saw that at my press conference today, and illegal means illegal. They're not supposed to be in the country. And we're either going to have a country or we're not. And if we're not going to have strong borders with a wall, which will make it very strong, by the way, and walls do work if they're properly built, not the little 11 foot walls that we have up right now, and they're not walls, they're fences.
There is a difference. But you know, I can understand him saying that. And other people have said it, too. But I believe we either have a country or we don't.
We either have laws in the country or we don't.
None. I mean, none. I really haven't had...
Worst business decision? Well, I've made some business decisions where markets changed, but in virtually every case, I was able to take those decisions and make them good, and take those jobs and make them good, which I think is a great test. I mean, I've had buildings going up and the market crashes, which is not my fault, and I go back and I negotiate with the banks, and I negotiate tough and I negotiate hard, and I've taken some jobs that were, that could have been disastrous and made them better than if the market had stayed the same. So I don't know, I view business, I view that question as something you have to learn from it, and you can never make a decision that's going to take you down. In other words, you're not going to do something that if it doesn't work out, because the best businessmen in the world, I know all of them, the best businessmen in the world have had difficult times, and they've had bad deals.
And you can never allow a deal, Hugh, to take you down. You just can't do it. So you have to know what you're doing. But one of the things, and I get a lot of credit in the world of business, I've taken deals that should have been bad, and I've made them great, better than if the markets stayed good.
And I'll tell you one thing, I bought deals for very low prices, like recently Doonbeg in Ireland, this incredible piece of land on the Atlantic Ocean, and other things, I've taken deals and bought deals that, and I bought them for very low prices, and turned them around and made them fantastic. So you know, I think you have to learn from business, and ideally, you want to learn from other people, not from yourself.
No, I don't think so, and I think one of the things you know about me, I've been a very public person. While I'm private, I've also been a very public person over many years. I mean, people know me. I'm very well known, and whether it's the great success on The Apprentice, where it was one of the top shows on television for a long time, and by the way, NBC renewed it, and is not in love with the fact that I didn't do it, but they renewed me for The Apprentice for many, many shows on The Apprentice, and you see the kind of money I made on The Apprentice, and I turned it down.
I said I'm going to run for president, I'm going to make America great again. They were not happy that I did that, so they're stuck in limbo. But they renewed The Apprentice. I didn't do it.
No, I think nothing. I'm a very public person, even though I'm private. I think you have seen me, and long before we met and spoke, you've seen me, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. So I would say nothing.
Yes, I do. I totally do. I think it's ridiculous.
All right, I think it's ridiculous. I'll have, I'm a delegator. I find great people. I find absolutely great people, and I'll find them in our armed services, and I find absolutely great people.
And now on the bigger picture, like the fact that our Kurds are being treated so poorly, and would really is the one group that really would be out there fighting for us, I think, and fighting for themselves, maybe more importantly to them, I understand that. But when you start throwing around names of people and where they live and give me their address, I think it's ridiculous, and I think it's totally worthless.
Well, and by the way, the names you just mentioned, they probably won't even be there in six months or a year.
Well, let's see what happens.
And you know what? In that case, first day in office, or before then, right at the day after the election, I'll know more about it than you will ever know. That I can tell you.
It will when it's appropriate. I will know more about it than you know, and believe me, it won't take me long.
But right now, right now, I think it's just something that, and you know what, if you ask these candidates, nobody's going to be able to give you an answer. I mean, there may be one that studied it because they're expecting a fresh question from you. But believe me, it won't matter. I will know far more than you know within 24 hours after I get the job.
Well, let's see what happens. I mean, I'm not sure that that's true. I think my numbers are very high now. But I'm not really sure that that's true, but I know you feel that.
I hope you're right. I mean, let's see what happens.
Thank you very much.
",Interview: Hugh Hewitt Interviews Donald Trump on His Syndicated Radio Show,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-hugh-hewitt-september-3-2015
Donald Trump,United States of America,2020-03-11,"My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nation’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world. Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic. We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people. This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus. From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges including large scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be.
It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China, and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection. And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seated by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans.
To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and South Korea, and as their situation improves, we will reevaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.
Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing. We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.
Additionally, last week I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly day by day. We are moving very quickly. The vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid non-essential travel in crowded areas. My administration is coordinating directly with communities with largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings.
Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow. Every community faces different risks, and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts and they are the best. For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home. To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taken emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus. I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.
Because of the economic policies that we have put into place, over the last three years we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far. Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way. This is not a financial crisis. This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.
However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus. Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in effected states and territories. These low interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.
Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully they will consider this very strongly. We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health and safety of the American people. I will always put the well-being of America first.
If we are vigilant and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will, we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family. As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity. Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you.
","Donald Trump Speech Transcript on Coronavirus, Ban on Europe Travel",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-on-coronavirus-ban-on-europe-travel
Gavin Williamson,United Kingdom,2020-04-20,"I’d like to welcome you to today’s briefing from Downing Street.
I am joined by Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, who will be sharing with you the latest detailed data on coronavirus.
On any normal Sunday afternoon, many of you would have been out with your family and friends enjoying the sunshine. And tomorrow, many children would be going to school for the first time after a two-week break.
But these are not normal times and we are asking you to stay at home, so can I start by thanking you for all the sacrifices that you’ve already had to make and that you continue to make.
I know this has not been easy. But it’s the surest way that we have to protect the NHS and to save lives.
I can report, through the Government’s ongoing monitoring and testing programme, as of today 482,063 tests for coronavirus have been carried out in Great Britain, including 21,626 test carried out yesterday.
120,067 people have tested positive – that’s an increase of 5,850 cases since yesterday. 18,118 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, compared to 18,006 on 17 April.
And sadly, of those hospitalised with the virus, 16,060 have now died. That’s an increase of 596 fatalities since yesterday.
We mustn’t forget that behind every single statistic there is a heart-breaking story and my sincere condolences go out to everyone has lost someone that they love.
These are challenging times for all of us and each of us has a role to play in fighting this virus. Those who are working in the NHS, those doctors, nurses, porters, cleaners and ambulance crews. They’re all doing an amazing job and are truly heroic in the part they are playing in supporting every one of us in this nation.
But today I would also like to say how enormously grateful we are to those who are working in our nurseries, schools colleges, universities and children’s services.
I am profoundly grateful for the vital role they are providing in our communities.
They have been keeping schools and nurseries open – including over the Easter holidays – so that our most vulnerable children and children of critical workers can continue to be supported and they can be cared for.
People are anxious to know when we are going to relax restrictions and when schools are likely to be fully back and open again. Of course, I want nothing more than to get schools back to normal, make sure that children are sat around learning and experiencing the joy of being at school.
But I can’t give you a date, because before we do, we need to meet five tests.
First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope and be sure that it can continue to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the whole of the UK.
Second, we need to see the daily death rates from coronavirus coming down.
Third, we need to have reliable data that shows the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels.
Fourth, we need to be confident that testing capacity and PPE are being managed, with supply able to meet not just today’s demand, but future demand.
And, fifth, and perhaps most crucially, we need to be confident any changes we do make will not risk a second peak of infections.
When we can be sure we have met these five essential points, we can think about getting children into schools again – learning, mastering new ideas and being with their friends once more.
We will work with the sector to consider how best to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges when the time is right.
Our first priority has always been protecting the wellbeing of children and young people, but particularly those vulnerable young people with special educational needs or a social worker.
Schools are open for them and we’re working to make sure those who should attend do so.
Places are available for children of critical workers too. With up to 130,000 children in school every single day, schools are helping keep the country moving.
And we are asking our local authorities and schools to ensure every vulnerable child knows that their school is there to support them, that systems are in place to keep in touch with those children who are unable to attend because of health reasons.
I know that families of seriously ill and disabled children are particularly worried at this time and I’m grateful to all staff who are working so hard to support their education, health and care – particularly those in special schools and residential care homes.
Young people who have left care or are just about to, whether that’s from a foster family or residential care, are really vulnerable right now. So I am asking local authorities to ensure that no one has to leave care during this difficult time.
The £1.6 billion of additional funding announced yesterday will help local authorities give care leavers, and other vulnerable groups, the support that they need at this difficult time.
To further protect children from harm, we are continuing to support Childline and working with NSPCC to expand and promote the adult helpline by providing them with an extra £1.6 million.
This means children have someone to call and more adults will be able to raise concerns and seek advice about the safety and wellbeing of any child that they’re worried about.
Like the rest of the population, all our teachers have had to adapt very quickly to new ways of working. They have had to move resources online, work remotely, change the way they support their students as well as one another.
I am immensely grateful to them and to everyone who has offered their support, including those who have made resources freely available for schools, parents and pupils to use.
We have already published an initial list of high quality online educational resources including how to support physical and mental wellbeing and materials for teaching children with special educational needs and disabilities.
In yet another example of how we are at our best when we work together, some of our leading state schools have collaborated to open The Oak National Academy, which will be launched online tomorrow.
This is a totally new initiative, led by 40 brilliant teachers who have assembled video lessons and resources for any teacher in the country to make use of if they wish to do so. 180 video lessons will be provided each week, across a broad range of subjects, for every year group from Reception through to Year 10.
I recognise all the challenges that families will be facing at the moment and we are determined to support parents who are helping their children learn from home. I think we all know how difficult that can be.
The BBC has developed resources for families as part of the most comprehensive education package in their history, available on TV and online from tomorrow morning.
And to make sure as many children as possible can access online learning, we are ordering laptops to help disadvantaged young people who sit key exams next year.
We will also provide laptops and tablets for those children with social workers and care leavers to help them stay in touch with the services they need, keeping them safe and supporting home learning.
And if disadvantaged secondary school pupils and care leavers who are preparing for exams do not already have internet connections, we’ll provide free 4G routers to get them connected while schools are closed.
We are also working with major telecommunications providers to exempt certain educational resources from data charges, so that this does not add to household expenses that may already be very stretched at this moment.
Before I finish, I would like to applaud the remarkable way our education community has responded to this outbreak. I am enormously proud and inspired by the incredible spirit they are showing.
Schools are supporting their communities in every way, from preparing food parcels to sharing their facilities with local hospitals. Colleges are manufacturing and donating equipment and universities are working flat out to develop diagnostic tests and, of course, a vaccine which will help us beat this invisible enemy.
And to any young people watching, I wanted to say to you how sorry I am that you have had your education disrupted in this way.
I know how hard it must be and I would like to thank you for making the adjustments you have had to make.
I know you will be missing your friends, your teachers and your lessons. I want you to know that you are an important part of this fight too and I cannot thank you enough for all that you are doing.
This global pandemic is the biggest threat that this country has faced in modern times. If we all continue to work together, as we have been, and if we continue to stick to the advice of our experts, we will come out the other side and be able to begin the task of rebuilding our communities.
I would like now to hand over to Jenny and then we will take some questions.
",2020 Statement on Coronavirus,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/gavin-williamson-2020-statement-on-coronavirus/
Leo Amery,United Kingdom,2015-03-19,"May I say that I agree wholeheartedly with what just fell from the lips of the hon. The whole of Parliament has a grave responsibility at this moment; for, after all, it is Parliament itself that is on trial in this war. If we lose this war, it is not this or that ephemeral Government but Parliament as an institution that will be condemned, for good and all. I fully realise that this is not an easy Debate. There is much that ought to be said which cannot well be said in public. After listening to some of the speeches to-day, not least the profoundly impressive speech made by my hon.
Meanwhile, even to-day there is plenty that can be said, that ought to be said, and that must be said frankly; for there are no loyalties to-day except to the common cause. This afternoon, as a few days ago, the Prime Minister gave us a reasoned, argumentative case for our failure. It is always possible to do that after every failure. Making a case and. winning a war are not the same thing. Wars are won, not by explanations after the event but by foresight, by clear decision and by swift action. I confess that I did not feel there was one sentence in the Prime Minister’s speech this afternoon which suggested that the Government either foresaw what Germany meant to do, or came to a clear decision when it knew what Germany had done, or acted swiftly or consistently throughout the whole of this lamentable affair. I am not going to discuss the reasons for the actual evacuation. They may well have been conclusive in the circumstances. But the circumstances should never have arisen; and it is the story of those events—of the decisions, of the absence of decisions, of the changes of decisions which brought about those circumstances—which call for our inquiry and raise many questions which have yet to be answered.
We were told by the Prime Minister on 2nd May that all except a relatively small advance guard of the Expeditionary Force which was earmarked for Finland had gone elsewhere and that the ships had been taken for employment for other purposes. Even the small, inadequate nucleus that was kept in being had no transports except warships. Why was this done? For months we had been aware that the Germans had been accumulating troops and transports and practising embarkation and disembarkation against somebody. It is perfectly true that they could spare the ships better than we could. But was there any reason which would make us believe that they were sending the men elsewhere? Obviously the danger was there and might develop into actuality at any moment. The Prime Minister suggested that we could not know which of many objectives it might be. Surely we had some good reasons for suspecting which one it might be. The Finnish war had focussed the interest of the whole world on Scandinavia. Within a week of its termination the Prime Minister declared, speaking of Norway and Sweden, that the danger to them—from Germany—”stands upon their very doorstep.” The Altmark affair had before that showed clearly the illegal uses which Germany was prepared to make of Norwegian neutrality. What is more, within a few days of that statement we ourselves decided deliberately to challenge Germany over her use of Norway’s territorial waters. All the world knew that that was the main theme of the deliberations of the Supreme War Council which met, I think, on 28th March. To make that perfectly clear to the whole world, including Germany, the Prime Minister said, on 2nd April: “We have not yet reached the limit of our effective operations in waters close to the German bases.” That was sufficient warning. On 8th April we laid our mines.
What did we expect to follow? Did we know Hitler and his merry men so little as to think that their rejoinder would be slow or half-hearted, or that it would follow the lines of “too little and too late” with which we have been so familiar here? However, it was not a question of a German rejoinder at all, but of Germany making our half-hearted intervention an excuse for measures far greater in scope and far more daring than we seem even to have envisaged. My hon. Does he realise that, from the moment we were in the war, Admiral Raeder insisted that this time the German Navy could not afford to be confined to the existing German coastline, but that, for the purposes of his air and submarine warfare, he must have not only egress from the Baltic but the whole of the indented, deep-water coastline of Norway?
I understand that information as to this reached our Departments early in January. Was that aspect of the strategic situation considered? Again, it was known everywhere that Hitler had designs on Scandinavia. Was it not obvious that the first stroke must be directed against Denmark and Norway, not only because they were weaker, but because once Hitler had seized them, Sweden was automatically within his power without the need for conquest? I would ask another question: Is it not a fact that the most direct warnings of Germany’s designs against Norway were sent from both Stockholm and Copenhagen in the first few days of April? I am afraid that what really happened was that, while we thought we were taking the initiative, our initiative, such as it was, only coincided with a far more formidable and far better planned initiative of the enemy.
I remember that many years ago in East Africa a young friend of mine went lion hunting. He secured a sleeping car on the railway and had it detached from the train at a siding near where he expected to find a certain man-eating lion. He went to rest and dream of hunting his lion in the morning. Unfortunately, the lion was out man-hunting that night. He clambered on to the rear of the car, scrabbled open the sliding door, and ate my friend. That is in brief the story of our initiative over Norway. In any case, even if we did not realise that the Germans were acting at the same time, why were we not prepared to meet their inevitable counter-stroke? We had only this inadequate little force, without transports, of which the Prime Minister has told us, in readiness to occupy Norwegian western ports if there were German action against Southern Norway. There was no plan to meet the contingency that Germany might seize the western ports as well or to meet any really serious attack by Germany upon Norway. As we know now, the German detachments for the more distant ports, Trondheim and Narvik, were despatched more than a week before, in readiness for the zero hour when all the German forces were to strike.
On 8th April we laid our mines. That time happened to be just before Germany’s zero hour. On the morning of that day a great German convoy sailed up the Kattegat and into the Skagerrak on its highly dangerous mission. To cover this daring manoeuvre the Germans sent a large part of their fleet, 48 hours before, away up the West coast of Norway towards Narvik. That action was duly reported to us, and the Prime Minister has told us that the Navy went off in hot pursuit after that German decoy. Rarely in history can a feint have been more successful. The gallantry of our officers and men in the blizzards of the Arctic, and the losses of the German fleet, serious as they were, do not alter the fact that the main German expedition to Norway took place without any interference from the Fleet, except from our submarines. With amazing courage and resolution, our submarines inflicted heavy losses on the Germans. How much heavier would those losses have been if the Fleet or any substantial portion of it had been there then, or, at any rate on subsequent days. That raises very formidable questions to which answers will have to be given sooner or later.
However, let me come to the next stage. What was our reaction when we learned that Oslo and all the main ports were in German hands? If we had any hope of retrieving the situation in Norway even partially, or of relieving the Norwegian forces, our obvious move was to retake one or other of those ports without a moment’s delay. We now know that the Germans seized them with only the tiniest handful of men. Only by seizing such a port would it have been possible to obtain landing facilities for our artillery and tanks, and above all, aerodromes, without which no operation could be conducted with any hope of success. The port clearly indicated by the circumstances was Trondheim, because it was farthest removed from the main German base at Oslo—which gave us time and the opportunity of maintaining railway connection with Sweden. We could have constructed a defensive line across the waist of Norway, behind which the Norwegian forces could have rallied, and from which we could have advanced, if necessary, to the recon quest of the country. That was the obvious plan.
The Prime Minister’s statements, however, make it clear that such forces as we had were at once sent off to Narvik, and not to their original destination of Trondheim or Bergen. Why Narvik? If we had held Trondheim, the isolated German force at Narvik would have been bound to surrender in time, and it could have done no mischief to us in the meantime. If we had ever contemplated retaking Trondheim at the start, there could have been no more crass instance of the dispersion, the frittering away, of forces. It is clear, however, from what the Prime Minister said to-day that the decision to send troops to Trondheim to try and retrieve that position was an afterthought, taken only after a number of days, and only at the urgent request of the Norwegians. How was it carried out? We have listened to the impressive speech of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Portsmouth. It is common knowledge that the original plan accepted by the Government for the taking of Trondheim was that the Navy should force its way into Narvik fiord while subsidiary landings took place to North and South. Once in the fiord our ships could command the whole of its vast coastline, with its roads and railway and its aerodrome. What we are entitled to ask is a very serious question: By whom and on whose authority was the indispensable hammer blow at Trondheim itself countermanded? Of course, there were risks. War is not won by shirking risks. Once the linch pin of the Trondheim operations was withdrawn, the rest was bound to fail precisely as it has failed.
As to those operations, there are many stories that reach us which cannot be discussed here. Our men did their best in impossible conditions, and one can only be glad that they got away. At the same time there is something which I feel bound to say. The Prime Minister, both the other day and to-day, expressed himself as satisfied that the balance of advantage lay on our side. He laid great stress on the heaviness of the German losses and the lightness of ours. What did the Germans lose? A few thousand men, nothing to them, a score of transports, and part of a Navy which anyhow cannot match ours. What did they gain? They gained Norway, with the strategical advantages which, in their opinion at least, outweigh the whole of their naval losses. They have gained the whole of Scandinavia. What have we lost? To begin with, we have lost most of the Norwegian Army, not only such as it was but such as it might have become if only we had been given time to rally and re-equip it. It goes to one’s heart to think of the Norwegian force strapped in southern Norway and forced to surrender after their bitter protest against our withdrawal. I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Opposition paid the tribute which he did to the gallantry of the Norwegian troops under adverse circumstances. What we have lost, above all, is one of those opportunities which do not recur in war. If we could have captured and held Trondheim, and if we could have rallied the Norwegian forces, then we might well have imposed a strain on Germany which might have made Norway to Hitler what Spain was once to Napoleon. All we can hope for now is that we may hang on to Narvik, and that will not be too easy, till the tide of war turns against Germany elsewhere. So much for the Norwegian chapter. It is a bad story, a story of lack of prevision and of preparation, a story of indecision, slowness and fear of taking risks. If only it stood alone. Unfortunately, it does not. It is only of a piece with the rest of it, of a piece with our hesitation and slowness in responding to Finland’s appeals for arms, in our handling of economic warfare and the reorganisation of industry, of our re-training of our workers, of the production of the essential munitions of war, of agriculture—in fact, the whole of our national effort, which, according to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is apparently to be at most 10 per cent. higher in the course of this year than it is to-day.
The right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister—I fully understand the good reason for his absence—in a digression explained why he used a certain unlucky phrase about Hitler missing the bus. He explained that what he meant was that during these eight months of war Hitler had lost the opportunity which he had at the beginning of the war because we had been catching up on Germany’s preparations. Believe me, that is very far from the truth. While we may catch up on her presently if only we do what we ought to, there is no doubt that during these eight months, thanks to Germany’s flying start and our slowness off the mark, the gap between the German forces and ours has widened enormously as far as troops, their equipment, tanks, guns and all the paraphernalia of land war are concerned. It has widened in the air, even if we reckon in things which may be “accruing” to us. That is a curious phrase, the precise meaning of which is difficult to determine. I remember that on the very morning of that speech I was reading the financial statement of a company which among its prospects included interest accruing to it from a mine in which gold had not yet been discovered.
We cannot go on as we are. There must be a change. First and foremost, it must be a change in the system and structure of our governmental machine. This is war, not peace. The essence of peace-time democratic government is discussion, conference and agreement; the Cabinet is in a sense a miniature Parliament. The main aim is agreement, the widest possible measure of agreement. To secure that it is necessary to compromise, to postpone, to rediscuss. Under those conditions there are no far-reaching plans for sudden action. It is a good thing to let policies develop as you go along and get people educated by circumstances. That may or may not be ideal in peace. It is impossible in war. In war the first essential is planning ahead. The next essential is swift, decisive action.
We can wage war only on military principles. One of the first of these principles is the clear definition of individual responsibilities—not party responsibilities or Cabinet responsibilities—and, with it, a proper delegation of authority. What commander-in-chief attempts to command 20 or 30 divisions in the field? He delegates the task to a number of army corps commanders responsible to him alone, and with authority over the divisional commanders underneath them. The last thing such a commander-in-chief would ever dream of doing is to make some of his army corps commanders divisional commanders as well. What is our present Cabinet system? There are some 25 Ministers, heads of Departments, who have no direct chief above them except the Prime Minister. How often do they see him? How often can they get from him direct advice, direct impulse, direct drive? Who is to settle disputes between them? There should be someone, not chairmen of innumerable committees, but someone with authority over these Ministers and directly responsible for their efficiency.
There is another cardinal principle of warfare: that is, the clear separation of the framing and execution of policy and the planning of operations, from administration. That is why every Army, Navy and Air Force has its General Staff. It is well known that the same man cannot do the work of administration and also frame and execute policy. How can you get either policy or administration from a Cabinet in which the two are mixed up hugger-mugger as they are at the present time? The next blow may fall at any moment. It may be in Holland; it may be in the Mediterranean. How many hours has any of the three Service Ministers been able to give during the last three weeks to the innumerable preparations required for that contingency? With the present organisation, there is not the slightest chance for them to consider these matters properly.
The Prime Minister has told us to-day of the change that he has made in at last giving a director and guide to the Chiefs of Staff Committee. He said that this struck him as being a good idea. For four years or more, ever since the Chiefs of Staff Committee was first spoken of in this House, some of us have said that it was impossible to produce adequate plans from a committee of men representing three separate Services, and each concerned to guard the interests of his own Service, without a chief over them. The result has inevitably been what I might call plans based on “the feeblest common denominator.” Now at last something is done to place the responsibility for framing and deciding plans clearly upon my right hon. Friend. The Prime Minister tells us that this has no connection with recent events in Norway; it is just a happy new idea. It is curious how we have for years now so effectively been locking the stable door always after we have discovered the loss of the horse. Anyhow, if those are the right functions for my right hon. Friend, how can he also carry on the tremendous tasks of the First Lord of the Admiralty? The Leader of the Opposition said that it was not fair to him. It is not fair to his colleagues; it is not fair to the nation.
Believe me, as long as the present methods prevail, all our valour and all our resources are not going to see us through. Above all, so long as they prevail, time is not going to be on our side, because they are methods which, inevitably and inherently, waste time and weaken decisions. What we must have, and have soon, is a supreme war directorate of a handful of men free from administrative routine, free to frame policy among themselves, and with the task of supervising, inspiring, and impelling a group of departments clearly allocated to each one of them. That is the only way. We learned that in the last war. My right hon. The experiment worked, and it helped to win the war. After the war years, the Committee of Imperial Defence laid it down as axiomatic that, while in a minor war you might go on with an ordinary Cabinet, helped perhaps by a War Committee, in a major war you must have a War Cabinet—meaning precisely the type of Cabinet that my right hon. Friend introduced then. The overwhelming opinion of this House and of the public outside has been demanding that for a long while. We are told that there would be no particular advantage in it at the present time. I ask, Is this or is this not a major war?
We must have, first of all, a right organisation of government. What is no less important to-day is that the Government shall be able to draw upon the whole abilities of the nation. It must represent all the elements of real political power in this country, whether in this House or not. The time has come when hon. and right hon. Members opposite must definitely take their share of the responsibility. The time has come when the organisation, the power and influence of the Trades Union Congress cannot be left outside. It must, through one of its recognised leaders, reinforce the strength of the national effort from inside. The time has come, in other words, for a real National Government. I may be asked what is my alternative Government. That is not my concern: it is not the concern of this House. The duty of this House, and the duty that it ought to exercise, is to show unmistakably what kind of Government it wants in order to win the war. It must always be left to some individual leader, working perhaps with a few others, to express that will by selecting his colleagues so as to form a Government which will correspond to the will of the House and enjoy its confidence. So I refuse, and I hope the House will refuse, to be drawn into a discussion on personalities.
What I would say, however, is this: Just as our peace-time system is unsuitable for war conditions, so does it tend to breed peace-time statesmen who are not too well fitted for the conduct of war. Facility in debate, ability to state a case, caution in advancing an unpopular view, compromise and procrastination are the natural qualities—I might almost say, virtues—of a political leader in time of peace. They are fatal qualities in war. Vision, daring, swiftness and consistency of decision are the very essence of victory. In our normal politics, it is true, the conflict of party did encourage a certain combative spirit. In the last war we Tories found that the most perniciously aggressive of our opponents, the right hon. Member for Carnarvon Boroughs, was not only aggressive in words, but was a man of action. In recent years the normal weakness of our political life has been accentuated by a coalition based upon no clear political principles. It was in fact begotten of a false alarm as to the disastrous results of going off the Gold Standard. It is a coalition which has been living ever since in a twilight atmosphere between Protection and Free Trade and between unprepared collective security and unprepared isolation. Surely, for the Government of the last 10 years to have bred a band of warrior statesmen would have been little short of a miracle. We have waited for eight months, and the miracle has not come to pass. Can we afford to wait any longer?

Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-03-15,"Thank you very much, Paul, and Vice President Pence, distinguished members of Congress, so many wonderful people from Ireland. So many friends, and we appreciate it -- for joining us on this very special occasion. It really is. First time was last year, and I still remember -- I said, ""That was a lot of fun."""" We'll do it -- I guess
Well, we're honored to welcome Taoiseach. We have a long experience. You'll explain it later, but we actually knew each other from a different life. And it was very successful.
I also want to warmly welcome Ambassador Mulhall, who has done an excellent job of representing a lot of good people. Thank you very much, Mr. Ambassador. Thank you, Greta, very much. And all of the really incredible Irish delegation who -- many of whom I know very well.
St. Patrick's Day is a time for us to honor and build upon the lasting bonds of our friendship between the United States and Ireland, bonds forged through a very common heritage, shared values, and a united vision for a peaceful and prosperous future.
More than 30 million Americans today claim Irish heritage. That's why you have such power in the halls of Congress and everywhere else. Thirty million people.
Among the many wonderful Americans who trace their routes back to Ireland are elected leaders like Paul, like Kevin, like Mike. I just have to look at almost this whole room. And a friend of mine, Cardinal Dolan, is a very, very proud person of Ireland.
It was our first Catholic President, John Kennedy, himself of Irish descent, who set our nation's sights on the moon. We're looking at Mars, by the way, in case anybody hasn't seen. We're going to get there. It's going to -- moving along pretty good. A lot of things have happened, Mike, having to do with that subject, way ahead of schedule.
And astronaut Michael Collins, who all know, and -- of Irish descent. And he piloted the Apollo 11 mission that planted the American footprint and the American flag where no man had ever gone before.
This impressive legacy of accomplishment is woven into our national character. The toughness, the grit, and the Fighting Irish resolve are fundamental American ways of life.
So on this St. Patrick's Day, we celebrate our long friendship and close ties with the people of Ireland. Special, incredible, wonderful people. And we look forward to an exciting future that we will all share together.
And it's an honor to have you with us. And I look forward to seeing you often. Whenever there's a problem, you call. We'll solve it. Okay? Except for trade. But congratulations. Great job. Thank you very much.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Addresses the Friends of Ireland Luncheon,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-friends-of-ireland-congress-march-15-2018
Donald Trump,United States of America,2018-10-17,"Thank you very much. Yeah, we'll start off with a prayer for our great Cabinet. And, Ben Carson, would you do the honors? Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Ben. That was very nice. Thank you. It's great to have everybody and have a little meeting. We're going to go over deregulation and some other things. If you'd like to stay, you're certainly entitled to.
Today's Cabinet meeting will focus on my administration's historic and unprecedented effort to remove job-killing regulations. They have been put on our country at a level over the last 15 and 20 years like nobody has ever seen before; more in the last 10 years than we had in every year put together.
We have eliminated more regulations than any administration ever -- even though it's substantially less than two years that we're here. We're lifting the crushing federal burdens on farmers, ranchers, factory workers, energy producers, and businesses of all types.
Along with our massive tax cuts and powerful trade policies, which you're seeing every day -- the deals we're making are unprecedented; great deals -- this regulatory rollback has helped to unleash an economic miracle: Jobless claims are at their lowest level in more than 50 years. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates have all recently achieved their lowest levels ever recorded.
And the economic pictures all throughout the country -- literally no matter what aspect of business, finance, economics you're talking about -- we're setting records. I can't think of any category of business where we're not setting records, unless it's negative, in which case we're way, way far away from those records.
The World Economic Forum just announced that the United States has reclaimed its place after a long absence as the world's most competitive economy and country. That's a great thing to have.
We've also ended the war on American energy. We are now the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And soon I'll be able to say ""by far."" We will be, by far, the largest.
We're removing red tape so we can substantially lower the price of healthcare premiums and prescription drugs. We've come out with healthcare programs that are incredible, that people are just starting to learn about.
We got rid of the individual mandate in Obamacare, and we're running Obamacare -- the remnants of it -- better than ever before. The premiums are going up at a much smaller rate. It will end up being over at some point.
We had it done, but unfortunately, somebody decided to vote against that at the last moment, even though they campaigned for years saying they were going to do it. But these are the facts of life. But it's of no import because it's happening anyway. But getting rid of the individual mandate was a very, very powerful thing.
We oppose efforts from Democrats to destroy your healthcare and to raid your Medicare to pay for socialism. And that's what's happening. You'll end up with Venezuela.
We totally support people with preexisting conditions. We have a tremendous level of talent, and we're doing a lot of work on preexisting conditions. And Democrats will never be able to pull that off.
I will be asking every Cabinet Secretary to continue identifying and removing every needless, wasteful, and job-killing regulation that remains on the books.
And while we've set a record -- even though it's a short period of time, we've set a record no President or administration has cut nearly as much. There are many, many left to do. And it will not hurt safety, it will not hurt health, it will not hurt anything. It will get things moving faster.
We have tremendous potential. Our country has tremendous potential. And a lot of it was held up by exactly what we're talking about. To stop offshoring and outsourcing, we are also fixing America's horrendous trade deals. You know all about that -- the deal with Canada, with Mexico, with South Korea. We're in a position where we're in very good shape with China. China wants to make a deal. And we're just -- I'm just saying they're not ready yet.
I told them, ""You're not ready to make a deal yet."" And I don't blame China. I blame the people that were in charge of running our country, for allowing that to happen. China was taking out $500 billion a year -- and more. And that should never have been allowed to happen.
But likewise, other countries are -- at a much smaller level are -- everybody does well against the piggy bank. And we're stopping that. We want fairness, and we're going to have fairness.
So the USMCA has turned out to be a deal that's been incredible for our farmers, for our manufacturers, for everybody. It's going through the process now. It's been approved by Mexico, been approved by Canada. And likewise, the deal, as you know, in South Korea was a deal made by the previous administration. It was unacceptable. It was so bad. It was unacceptable. It was a tremendous drag on this country, and we've changed it. And now it's a very good deal for our country.
So that's why we're here. And I think what we'll do is we'll start on the regulation aspect by asking Director Mulvaney to give you an update as to exactly what's been going on. Where is Mick?
That is true. Right.
That is a big factor. Thank you very much, Mick. Secretary Zinke? Thank you.
Very good. Thank you very much. That's music to my ears. Secretary, please.
That is great. And I think one thing -- very important -- roadways and highways were taking forever to get approved.
And we've cut them down many, many years. And ultimately, maybe we'll get down to one, but we are getting very close to two. And in some cases, you know many stories where they're 21, 22 years -- 18 years, 19 years to get just approvals. And in many cases, they don't get approved. After spending tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars on the approval process, in many cases they don't even get approved after so many years.
So we're down to two years. We'll very soon be down to two years, and maybe we'll even do better than that. And they may not get approved, and that's okay, too, but at least you're going to know if it's not going to happen.
Secretary Perdue, Agriculture, please.
And we have to do that in California, by the way.
California is a mess. We're giving billions and billions of dollars for forest fires in California. There's no reason for those fires to be like they are. They are leaving them dirty. It's a disgraceful thing.
Old trees are sitting there rotting and dry. And instead of cleaning it up, they don't touch them; they leave them. And we end up with these massive fires that we're paying hundreds of billions of dollars for -- to fix. And the destruction is incredible.
So I think California ought to get their act together and clean up their forests and manage their forests, because it's disgraceful. What's happening should never happen. I go all over the country and I meet with governors. The first thing they say is, ""There's no reason for forest fires like that in California.""
So I say to the governor or whoever is going to be the governor of California: You better get your act together. Because California, we're just not going to continue to pay the kind of money that we're paying because of fires that should never be to the extent -- they were telling me in a couple of states -- I won't even mention their name -- it's like a flash. Some grass will burn; it'll be over in minutes. They'll lose two acres, three acres at the most. They won't even lose that. And here we are with thousands of acres and billions and billions of dollars. Every year, it's the same thing. Every year.
And they don't want to clean up their forests because they have environmental problems in cleaning it up. It should be the opposite because you're going to lose your forests. You're losing them. But it's costing our country hundreds of billions of dollars because of incompetence in California.
So the people -- I'm speaking now for the people of California. They don't want to see this happen. They're getting destroyed. And it's hurting our budgets, it's hurting our country, and they just better get their act together.
I'm sorry, go ahead.
That's right.
Big difference.
I hear it's a big difference.
Great job. Thank you very much. SBA, deregulation -- a woman who has done a fantastic job, and I appreciate it. Linda, please.
Thank you very much, Linda. Appreciate it. USMCA -- it's new, it's good. It takes the place of NAFTA, which was a total disaster. Thousands of factories and plants closed. The farmers were never treated properly by NAFTA. The USMCA is a whole different ballgame. It opens up Canada. It opens up Mexico for our farmers and for others.
And I'd like to have Bob Lighthizer, who's really worked so hard -- 24 hours, around the clock -- for a long time, many months. Bob, maybe you could give a little briefing, please.
Thank you very much, Bob. And I have to say that these are countries, in every instance, which had no intention of ever negotiating with the United States. They were not going to. They were very happy with the deals the way they were. Speaking for Mexico, Canada, South Korea -- every one of them.
You go to the European Union, they had no intention of renegotiating; now they're renegotiating. We'll see what happens with that one. They've treated us very harshly for many, many years, taking out tremendous amounts of money over $150 billion a year for many years. And frankly, it's ridiculous. It's hard to believe that we could've allowed ourselves to be put in that position. And that's why we have debt, and that's why we have tremendous deficits.
. It's not even a conceivable number.
So we're negotiating. And again, they wouldn't negotiate at the beginning. I said, ""That's okay. You don't have to negotiate."" I said, ""Why aren't you going to negotiate?"" ""Because we're very happy with our deal. We're extremely happy with our deal."" And I said, ""But I'm not happy with your deal.""
And I said, ""That's okay. We're going to put tariffs on every product you sell to the United States."" And they said, ""We would like to negotiate immediately.""
And President Obama was unable to get anybody even to go to the table. And that goes for previous administrations also, too. It's incredible. And again, China; you could look at Vietnam; you could look at every country -- just about every country. Incredible that we allowed this as a country to happen. And it's not going to happen any longer. And that just shows the tremendous potential we have. Because we had these horrible trade deals, we had these horrible military deals, where we paid for everybody's military, or we certainly don't get subsidized or paid back what we should be. And that includes NATO, where we're paying for 90 percent of NATO to protect Europe. And I think it's all fine, but they have to pay.
I got them to put up $44 billion last year. They're going to put up at least that amount this year, maybe more. They should pay for the whole thing right away. But we're paying for NATO. We are paying to protect Europe. And then on top of that, Europe treats us very badly on trade. So we lose on a double -- it's a double whammy, I call it.
So all of that is changing; it's changing rapidly. We're in a very strong negotiating position because we're the piggybank that everybody wants to rob. And I don't blame China, and I don't blame Europe, and I don't blame anybody. I blame our politicians, and I blame our leaders for allowing this to happen. There was no reason for it.
So we're making up for lost time, and we'll do it properly. I'd like to have Larry Kudlow speak and maybe talk about where we are with the economy, how good it's doing. It's been setting records despite all of the above. And, Larry, I guess that's why I say the potential is so enormous. Because you look at what happens to us on the military -- the massive amounts of money.
You look at -- we have 716-billion-dollar budgets; Russia has a budget of $68 billion. China has a budget that's just a small fraction of what we spend. It's absolutely ridiculous. And that's because we protect every country in the world practically. And some of these countries are massively wealthy and they don't pay us for the protection. It's crazy.
So, Larry, please.
Thank you, Larry. Thanks. Good job. I just asked Larry, has he done that before? I think so. Ben, what do you think.
That was great. But he's never been this optimistic. I've watched Larry for many, many years. I hear that voice -- that beautiful voice. I say, ""That's Larry."" I can tell Larry in my sleep. And I've never seen him more positive than you've been in the last couple of months. And you've done a great job, but I appreciate you doing that.
Thank you very much, Larry. Appreciate it. And I think Larry is going to be very happy with what I'm going to say. I might as well leave the press to say it because it will put more pressure on all of the people gathered around our table.
I'm going to ask each of you to come back with a 5-percent budget cut from your various departments. Whether it's a secretary, an administrator, whatever, I'm going to ask everybody with a 5-percent cut for our next meeting. I think you'll all be able to do it. There may be a special exemption, perhaps. I don't know who that exception would be. If you can do more than five -- some of you will say, ""Hey, I can do much more than five.""
You know, I've heard about the penny plan for 15 years. One penny every year per dollar -- one penny every year -- after four or five years, the country is in good shape. I'm saying, let's not do the penny plan; let's do the five-penny plan. I think you can do it.
So I'd like to have everyone sitting around the table -- your incredible domains that you preside over so brilliantly, in some cases. In some cases very well; in some cases brilliantly. I would like you to come back with a 5-percent cut. Get rid of the fat. Get rid of the waste. And I'm sure you can do it. I'm sure everybody at this table can do it. It will have a huge impact.
Last budget we had to go -- because of the military -- we had to fix our military. Our military is in the process of being fixed. Planes are being made. Boats are being made. Ships are being made. Missiles, rockets, everything. Our nuclear is being brought to a level that nobody else could even imagine. Pray to God we don't have to use it. But there will be nothing like what we have, and there is nothing like what we have.
And that's why I did that. I made deals with the devil in order to get that done, because we had to improve our military. Our military was depleted. It was in bad shape. Our great people in the military hadn't received a wage increase in more than 10 years. Now they're getting an increase. First time in more than 10 years.
So I wanted to do that and -- in order to get that done -- because the Democrats won't vote for the military. They don't like the military. They don't like law enforcement. They don't like borders.
You see what's happening with the border, where people are coming up in caravans and we have to stop them even though the laws are terrible. The laws are terrible. Our laws are terrible. They're a laughingstock all over the world. And we're supposed to stop people with laws that aren't very good, but we're doing better than anybody else could possibly even think about.
But I'd like you all to come back with a 5-percent cut. And I think if you can do more than that, we will be very happy. There are some people sitting at the table -- I'm not going to point you out -- but there are some people that can really do substantially more than that. Because now that we have our military taken care of, we have our law enforcement taken care of, we can do things that we really weren't in a position to do when I first came.
So we'll see you at the next meeting. I'll see you many times before. I'm sure I'll speak to all of you during this term. But that's a very, very important request that I'm making of everybody sitting around this table. It's tremendous amounts of money, and it's something that we can do.
And I believe we could actually do it, easily. So rather than go by the penny plan, we'll call it the nickel plan. At least it will be a one-year nickel plan. We may do another nickel plan next year too.
Thank you all very much. To the press, thank you very much.
We know what the budget -- the new budget is for the Defense Department. It will probably be $700 billion. So it's 716; it was 700 -- 716. And that's a very substantial number but it's defense. It's very important. I mean, to us, without defense, maybe the rest of it doesn't mean very much.
. And the reason I brought it up to 700 and then 716 was to build new ships. We're building new, incredible submarines, the finest in the world. The most powerful in the world, anywhere, ever.
We're doing things that we have never done on this scale. So that included a lot of rebuilding of our military. So despite that, I'm going to keep that at $700 billion -- defense. Okay?
No, they're just -- they're great, very talented people. They're not investigating themselves. They're going to cut costs. These all talented people. They have now been here long enough to be able to do this.
They are -- it's a great group around this table. It's a great group. And they'll be able to do it. And when you add this and couple this with what Larry Kudlow said about how well we're doing, I wouldn't -- where is Larry?
I mean, Larry has to be very happy when he hears this. You didn't even expect this, right? Did you expect this, Larry?
Yeah. I mean, this is part of it. This is all part of it. I just couldn't do it last year because of the fact that we had to do our military. Our military was in really bad shape.
You had planes -- you had planes that couldn't fly. You had -- you had military that was really in a ridiculous situation. So that's what we had to do.
So what they're doing is they're doing it themselves. Okay, any other questions? Steve, go ahead.
I told them they're not ready yet.
No, because they've had -- they make too much --
We have rebuilt China, just so you understand. Our country has rebuilt China -- with their hardworking genius also. But how our country has allowed itself to lose $500 billion a year, and much more than that, is ridiculous -- is ridiculous.
So it's hard for them to do a deal because they've had it so good for so long. It's a very hard thing for them to do. But we have a very good relationship with China. We have -- I have a great relationship with President Xi. And I think you'll see something happen that going to be good for both countries. Okay?
Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.
",Remarks: Donald Trump Holds a Cabinet Meeting,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-cabinet-meeting-october-17-2018
Nicola Sturgeon,United Kingdom,2020-05-07,"Good afternoon, thank you for joining us today.
I want to start with the usual statistical update in relation to COVID-19.
As at 9 o’clock this morning, there have been 12,437 positive cases confirmed – which is an increase of 171 since yesterday.
A total of 1,656 patients are currently in hospital with either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 – that is a decrease of 64 since yesterday.
A total of 104 people last night were in intensive care with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and that is an increase of five since yesterday.
I can also confirm that since 5 March, 2,847 patients who had tested positive and been hospitalised for the virus have now been able to leave hospital, and that of course is positive news
Sadly, though, in the last 24 hours, 44 deaths have been registered of patients who had been confirmed through a test as having the virus – which takes the total number of deaths, under that measurement, to 1,620.
Now, as I always say, we must never ever think of these numbers as just statistics. They represent individuals whose loss is a source of sorrow to many, and I again want to send my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one to this virus. We are all thinking of you.
I also want to again thank our health and care workers for the extraordinary work that you continue to do for us in the most challenging and difficult of circumstances
Now I have one substantive issue that I want to discuss today. And forgive me if I do so at slightly greater length than normal.
This follows my update yesterday on our plans for “test, trace, and isolate”.
Today, I want to set out for you our latest data on the level of infection and the important R number that you have heard us talk about before, and I also want to describe the work that we are doing now to prepare for careful and gradual changes to the lockdown restrictions – I must stress only when we judge it is safe to make them, which I am afraid is not right now.
Now you’ll find more detail on what I am about to cover today in a new document that we have just published on the gov.scot website – it updates the one we published a couple of weeks ago and, again, I’m asking you please to have a look at that.
I also want to encourage you to use the new online tool that we are launching today, which gives you the chance to offer ideas on how we should move forward.
I’ve said before but it is worth repeating that the decisions on how we come out of lockdown will affect each and every one of us, perhaps for some considerable time to come, and so I am determined that I and the Scottish Government make those decisions as openly and as collaboratively as we possibly can.
Now, as I said yesterday, by Thursday this week, we have to formally assess whether any lockdown restrictions should be lifted at this stage. The other UK governments will also be making an assessment on or around that date.
As we move forward, we will continue to discuss and, where appropriate, reach decisions on a four nations – UK – basis. It remains my intention to have UK-wide alignment where the evidence supports it, though obviously my overarching responsibility is to reach evidence based decisions that are right for Scotland.
As I indicated yesterday, I think it is highly unlikely that the Scottish Government will be able to make any significant changes to the current restrictions on Thursday. And I think it’s important that I’m frank with you about that now.
Today’s paper sets out in detail the data that underpins that conclusion.
In short, we are seeing progress – real progress, particularly in the number of people admitted to intensive care – but that progress is still fragile.
That means any increase in the physical interactions we have with other people could quickly see transmission of the virus increase again.
We estimate that there are currently around 26,000 people with COVID-19 in Scotland. I stress these are estimates, but that is still too high a number to consider that the virus is under control.
I have also spoken before about the vital importance – the critical importance – of keeping the R number below 1.
Now we know the R number is higher in care homes, but our best estimate is that the R number in the community is currently between 0.7 and 1. But we cannot be sure that it’s not closer to 1 than 0.7.
There is also some evidence that the R number in Scotland might be slightly higher at this point than in the rest of the UK – although the modelling that is based on is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
But in any event, the R number is not yet far enough below 1 to be confident that any changes to current restrictions wouldn’t quickly send it over 1 again – and if that happened, the virus would start to increase exponentially again.
That could overwhelm our health service; force us to re-impose restrictions; and it would lead to many more deaths.
Now as an illustration of this, we include in the paper a chart which is based on recent Danish data, and we are looking at experiences in other countries all the time. What this chart suggests is that that if we were to fully re-open nurseries and primary schools now, the most likely scenario would be a resurgence in the virus that would overwhelm our hospital capacity in a matter of weeks.
Now, the fact is that any easing of restrictions, whenever we introduce them, will have an impact on the R number. But if we get our baseline lower than it is now, we will have more headroom to cope with that – and be able to avoid outcomes like the one I’ve just highlighted.
So the hard fact is that we must see further reductions in new cases, hospital and ICU admissions and deaths to be sure that the overall level of infection and the R number are lower than they are now.
And that means, for the moment, we do need to stick with the current lockdown restrictions .
However I am acutely aware that the severity of restrictions we are living under now cannot continue indefinitely – we know that lockdown is doing its own damage.
So we also need to be preparing to make changes as soon as it is safe to do so.
The next three week period of lockdown, after this Thursday 7 May, is due to end on the 28 May.
Now, let me stress, that doesn’t necessarily mean we can’t make any changes before then if the evidence suggests it is safe to do so. If we can, we will.
For example, I’m particularly keen as soon as possible, for the sake of mental health and wellbeing, to enable people to be outdoors more. And obviously we are all keen to get the economy moving again as soon as we can.
So today’s paper sets out some options that we are working on – both in terms of assessing their impact and on the practicalities of implementation – so that we will be ready to make changes when the evidence tell us that it is safe to do so.
Now to be clear with you, because I have to make sure I am setting this out clearly, this is not a list of things we will definitely do by certain dates.
Indeed, we might not be able to take all of these steps even at the end of May.
This is going to be a long process with different phases along the way.
And we will only implement these changes when we are as certain as possible that it is safe to do so – and when we can also assure you of that.
In the meantime, it is vital that we stick rigorously to the current rules.
But as I said a moment ago it is important that we are preparing now.
So I want to briefly set out the options that we are working on. Though, again, I must stress that none of these are changes we are implementing as of right now.
But we are considering, firstly, if and how we could safely change our advice on spending time outdoors – to allow exercise outside to happen more than once a day, so long as we continue to stay apart from people outside our own households.
But second, we are also considering if a slight relaxation in the rules to allow meeting up with a small, defined group of people from other households – in a sort of bubble – might be possible, even if initially that was only possible out of doors and not indoors.
This is, of course, one way in which we could start to interact a bit more with family or friends – which I know is so important to all of us.
However, we also have to consider carefully the impact on the spread of the virus. And we have to think through how such an approach could be implemented in practice – and also how the limitations of it could be enforced if necessary.
It’s also not something that would be possible for those who are currently shielding – so we have to think also about the fairness of it.
The third area we are looking at is when and in what order we can resume some NHS and community care services. As you know, we stopped some services – for example, screening programmes and non-urgent elective procedures – to ensure that the NHS could cope with the virus. But these postponements also have implications for health, so we must consider how services can be restarted as soon as possible – and that is what we are currently doing.
The fourth area relates to how we carefully, gradually and safely allow businesses to re-open. That is a major area of work, for obvious reasons.
We need to work with business and with trade unions to consider the practical arrangements for different work environments to start up safely – that’s changes to working practices, physical layouts of workplaces, the appropriate use of PPE and the operation of public transport. On this, we are looking carefully at the work the UK government is doing and consulting our own stakeholders on that.
Initially, we are giving particular consideration to businesses in the construction, retail and manufacturing sectors – and also to some outdoor and rural businesses.
However, where home working is possible, we are very likely to insist on that for the foreseeable future.
And I want to be very clear that as of now current guidance to business remains in place.
Finally, I have said before that one of the hardest decisions I have ever taken was the closure of schools. I know the impact this is having on young people – and I want to thank all of you watching today again for your patience – and it also has an impact on family routine.
The Deputy First Minister is chairing the Education Recovery Group, which is considering options for how pupils might gradually return to school.
Now, again, I need to be clear – a return to school might not be possible at all this side of the summer holidays.
But we are considering whether some groups of students – such as vulnerable children, children who are making the transition from primary to secondary school, or who are studying for national qualifications – could return to school ahead of others.
And any initial return to school – when it does happen – is of course likely to require a mixture of time in school and learning at home.
For example it’s possible that different groups could attend school part-time in blocks of a few days – or a week at a time – to enable physical distancing and deep cleaning schools between sessions. In all of this, we are trying to find the right balance between children’s educational and wider needs, and public health imperatives.
But I want to be crystal clear that while we will of course take the greatest care in all of this, that that is particularly the case with schools. We will not compromise the safety of your children.
Now as you will understand from the detail I have just given, and more so if you read the paper that has published today, none of these decisions are easy. There are no absolute certainties in any of this and complex judgments will have to be made.
As I’ve said before, ‘lifting the lockdown’ will not be like flicking a switch.
It will be a gradual process which will happen in phases.
What we are seeking to do is find a path to a new normal – one which is less restrictive than the current lockdown, but which doesn’t risk the virus running rampant again.
Now we have not yet put definite dates on any of what I’ve just set out. But I will update you on an ongoing basis in the days ahead as our evidence, assessments and planning develops.
And as soon as we can start to attach even tentative dates, we will do that.
In parallel, we will continue to build the ‘test, trace, isolate’ capacity that I spoke about yesterday.
But let me end on this point – the most important task for all of us in the here and now is to get the virus under more control than it is right now. And I cannot stress that enough. We really are at a critical stage, and what I’ve set out today about our assessment of the R number in particular tells us how critical this stage is and also how easy it would be to go in the wrong direction.
So that means asking you again to stick rigorously to the current rules. It means asking you to think hard about your own compliance – and tightening that if anything now, not easing up on it. If you have been going out a bit more than you should, please rectify that.
Please stay at home except for essential purposes – and remember, at this stage, essential purposes means only essential food supplies, medicines and daily exercise.
And you should ask yourself if, for example, going for a drive-through coffee is really an essential journey.
Stay two metres from others when you have to be out.
Don’t meet up with people from other households.
Isolate completely if you or anyone else in your household has symptoms.
Wash your hands regularly, and wear a face covering if you are in an enclosed space with other people – like a shop or public transport.
All of this is tough – it is really tough – and I know and understand that.
But I want to stress again – right now we are going in the right direction. If all we keep doing all of the right things, we will keep going in the right direction, and we will get there. Our light at the end of the tunnel that I keep talking about will get brighter as the days go on. And we will find a way through.
So please keep doing the right things, and thank you for everything that you are doing to comply.
Now I’m going to hand over to the Chief Medical Officer who is going to say a few more words about the evidence that is before us before I open up to questions.

James Buchanan,United States of America,1860-05-19 00:00:00,"On the 26th day of April last Lieutenant Craven, of the United States steamer Mohawk, captured the slaver Wildfire on the coast of Cuba, with 507 African negroes on board. The prize was brought into Key West on the 31st April and the negroes were delivered into the custody of Fernando J. Moreno, marshal of the southern district of Florida.
The question which now demands immediate decision is, What disposition shall be made of these Africans? In the annual message to Congress of December 6, 1858, I expressed my opinion in regard to the construction of the act of the 3d March, 1819, ""in addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade,"" so far as the same is applicable to the present case. From this I make the following extract:
Under the second section of this act the President is ""authorized to make such regulations and arrangements as he may deem expedient for the safe-keeping, support, and removal beyond the limits of the United States of all such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color"" captured by vessels of the United States as may be delivered to the marshal of the district into which they are brought, ""and to appoint a proper person or persons residing upon the coast of Africa as agent or agents for receiving the negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color delivered from on board vessels seized in the prosecution of the slave trade by commanders of United States armed vessels.""
A doubt immediately arose as to the true construction of this act. It is quite clear from its terms that the President was authorized to provide ""for the safe-keeping, support, and removal"" of these negroes up till the time of their delivery to the agent on the coast of Africa, but no express provision was made for their protection and support after they had reached the place of their destination. Still, an agent was to be appointed to receive them in Africa, and it could not have been supposed that Congress intended he should desert them at the moment they were received and turn them loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victims of the slave trade. Had this been the intention of Congress, the employment of an agent to receive them, who is required to reside on the coast, was unnecessary, and they might have been landed by our vessels anywhere in Africa and left exposed to the sufferings and the fate which would certainly await them.
Mr. Monroe, in his special message of December 17, 1819, at the first session after the act was passed, announced to Congress what in his opinion was its true construction. He believed it to be his duty under it to follow these unfortunates into Africa and make provision for them there until they should be able to provide for themselves. In communicating this interpretation of the act to Congress he stated that some doubt had been entertained as to its true intent and meaning, and he submitted the question to them so that they might, ""should it be deemed advisable, amend the same before further proceedings are had under it."" Nothing was done by Congress to explain the act, and Mr. Monroe proceeded to carry it into execution according to his own interpretation. This, then, became the practical construction.
Adopting this construction of President Monroe, I entered into an agreement with the Colonization Society, dated 7th September, 1858, to receive the Africans which had been captured on the slaver Echo from the agent of the United States in Liberia, to furnish them during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter, clothing, and provisions, and to cause them to be instructed in the arts of civilized life suitable to their condition, at the rate of $150 for each individual. It was believed that within that period they would be prepared to become citizens of Liberia and to take care of themselves.
I regret to say that under the mode adopted in regard to the Africans captured on board the Echo the expense will be large, but this seems to a great extent to be inevitable without a violation of the laws of humanity. The expenditure upon this scale for those captured on board the Wildfire will not be less than $100,000, and may considerably exceed that sum. Still, it ought to be observed that during the period when the Government itself, through its own agents, undertook the task of providing for captured negroes in Africa the cost per head was much greater than that which I agreed to pay the Colonization Society.
But it will not be sufficient for Congress to limit the amount appropriated to the case of the Wildfire. It is probable, judging from the increased activity of the slave trade and the vigilance of our cruisers, that several similar captures may be made before the end of the year. An appropriation ought therefore to be granted large enough to cover such contingencies.
The period has arrived when it is indispensable to provide some specific legislation for the guidance of the Executive on this subject. With this view I would suggest that Congress might authorize the President to enter into a general agreement with the Colonization Society binding them to receive on the coast of Africa, from an agent there, all the captured Africans which may be delivered to him, and to maintain them for a limited period, upon such terms and conditions as may combine humanity toward these unfortunates with a just economy. This would obviate the necessity of making a new bargain with every new capture and would prevent delay and avoid expense in the disposition of the captured. The law might then provide that in all cases where this may be practicable the captor should carry the negroes directly to Africa and deliver them to the American agent there, afterwards bringing the captured vessel to the United States for adjudication.
The capturing officer, in case he should bring his prize directly to the United States, ought to be required to land the negroes in some one or more ports, to be designated by Congress, where the prevailing health throughout the year is good. At these ports cheap but permanent accommodations might be provided for the negroes until they could be sent away, without incurring the expense of erecting such accommodations at every port where the capturing officer may think proper to enter. On the present occasion these negroes have been brought to Key West, and, according to the estimate presented by the marshal of the southern district of Florida to the Secretary of the Interior, the cost of providing temporary quarters for them will be $2,500 and the aggregate expenses for the single month of May will amount to $12,000. But this is far from being the worst evil. Within a few weeks the yellow fever will most probably prevail at Key West, and hence the marshal urges their removal from their present quarters at an early day, which must be done, in any event, as soon as practicable. For these reasons I earnestly commend this subject to the immediate attention of Congress. I transmit herewith a copy of the letter and estimate of Fernando J. Moreno, marshal of the southern district of Florida, to the Secretary of the Interior, dated 10th May, 1860, together with a copy of the letter of the Secretary of the Interior to myself, dated 16th May.
It is truly lamentable that Great Britain and the United States should be obliged to expend such a vast amount of blood and treasure for the suppression of the African slave trade, and this when the only portions of the civilized world where it is tolerated and encouraged are the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico.

Joe Biden,United States of America,2020-04-22,"… and the whole world with it. This issue is personal to me. When I was a kid, when we moved from Scranton, Pennsylvania out to Delaware, I moved to a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware, and you’re very familiar with this because we’ve talked about it. Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania has more oil refineries along the Delaware River for the Delaware Valley of 10 million people then even down in Houston.
When we first moved there, we went to a little school about, I guess, it was about 20 blocks as you’d walk it and up what they call the Philadelphia Pike, but the Philadelphia Pike was before I-95 and it was kind of busy so we couldn’t walk as kids. I was going into third grade and so my mother used to drive us up and when it got to be a little colder in the first frost, you’d get in a car in the apartments we lived in, turn on the windshield wipers, there’d actually be an oil slick in the windows.
Literally, not a joke. Delaware on average is only three feet above sea level. This is personal to me from a time I’m a kid to now. Look, going to fight for … This is all about our grandkids. We just talking about our grandkids for our families and hammered by superstorms and pollution and the upside of this is there’s good jobs out there. We’re going to be able to create a lot of good jobs. But I should stop talking, Al, because I want to ask you a question. You’ve been working on this issue for a long time. Why is climate change so important in this election?
That’s right.
That’s incredible.
Wow, Al. Thanks so much. It means a lot to me. I often say beating Trump won’t end climate change, but it’s a critical first step. Last week, Trump reversed the rule requiring power plants to reduce the amount of mercury and other pollutions that are pumping into the air. Pollution that is bad for human health, to state the obvious, and it’s wrong. It’s a step backwards.
As we see, as we try to seek some progress he’s eviscerating the EPA and everything that’s out there. But particularly dangerous is now, I believe, for communities of color, communities suffered disproportionately during this global health crisis. We’re seeing it happen now and one reason for this portion of impact is air pollution linked up to 15% increase in COVID-19 mortality in those most vulnerable. People of color are more likely to live in communities with air pollution.
Just one example of the environmental injustice in Delaware, as I said, we get it and we can identify it. That’s why we have one of the highest cancer rates. Anyway, I don’t want to get into too much about Delaware, but the United States of America, you shouldn’t be poisoned by the air you breathe, the water you drink, the walls in your homes or your school. That’s why we need to invest in infrastructure to make sure that every city, every home, every school has clean water. It shouldn’t be more likely to breathe poisoned air and drink poison water based on your zip code or the color of your skin.
My question, Al, is we need to act on climate, we need to address the environmental injustices that hold back too many communities of color across the country, what’s the top action we should be doing to address this environmental injustice, not just dealing overall of the environment, the injustice the way it falls on certain communities?
Oh, by the way, I don’t want to get off on it now, but one of the things, the Navajo Nation is being devastated right now. I met with the president, and we know him. They’re getting virtually no help, but that’s another issue maybe. A gigantic issue, but it goes to this whole … One of the things I’m hoping, Al, is I’m hoping that it’s kind of like the way this administration has dealt with the COVID pandemic as well as the environment has sort of taking the blinders off of people.
People now are looking to say, my Lord, you mean that same person who kept my sewer open and my basement not flooding, the same person that made sure that I got pulled out of that car crash, you mean the same person who when I have trouble comes to take care of my home when it’s burning down, you mean those people? They’re the ones who in fact are getting screwed?
Well, I think here’s the question. Look, I think this resonates with an awful lot of people now, many of whom it didn’t resonate before, not because they didn’t care, but they didn’t focus on it. They didn’t realize the consequence. My question is and as often relates to climate change, you hear politicians talk about, this is one of the questions, addressing climate change and that they can create real jobs and that we can turn this from a very big negative into a potential positive. Is that true, you think?
Good point.
Bingo.
I agree.
They are. I’ll tell you what, Al, in large part because you opened everybody’s eyes worldwide to this awhile ago. Look, climate change is a threat, but I think it’s a gigantic opportunity. Everybody has different proposals. I asked you to take a look at mine. But the $1.7 trillion plan, I have to invest $1 trillion in green infrastructure right off the bat. We can transform the country. Just imagine 500,000 new charging stations on every highway that exists or every new highway built. We can own the electric power, and we can own the electric vehicle market. We can create millions of good … By the way, the jobs we’re talking about are not minimum wage jobs. They’re jobs that pay 30, 40, 50, 60 bucks an hour with benefits. These are real jobs. They’re union jobs in many cases. We have to improve energy efficiency.
We can cut the carbon footprint of US buildings in half by 2035, and you know the numbers better than I do. Offer one, we had this big fight about tax credits for renewable energy, solar and wind, new battery technologies, modernizing the electric grid, which I really need your help on. But when we’re working on, that’s a gigantic potential breakthrough if that happens and when it happens. We’re investing $400 billion in new energy research and development. That’s more than we took to send a man to the moon. Almost every expert starting with you points out that creates 10 million good-paying jobs. The fastest growing jobs, as you said, are solar installers and wind turbine engineers.
By the way, Donald Trump is really the stable genius indicated that windmills cause cancer. That was news to me and everybody in Iowa and everywhere else around the country that’s doing this. But, I mean, come on. The IBW workers at Techin are making 60,000 bucks a year.
Clean energy was the engine of recovery from the great recession. When the president asked me to get engaged in dealing with the recovery act, it’s going to be even bigger now, a bigger engine in terms of recovery from this economic storm that we’re going through right now. It’s logical, and it’s rational. So one of the things that I think is happening now, you pointed out that American business is realizing-
You pointed out that American business is realizing they have to price in the price of carbon in the way that… They are looking at their bottom line and reduce carbon. Well, you got the major unions in the country who’ve endorsed me, they now realize this transition is going to happen. It’s happening anyway and they should own it. They should be the people who in fact have the access to these new good paying union jobs. And so look, I’m getting too excited about this, but look.
Look, other major countries around the world are polluters as well. We make up 15% of the problem and 85%’s quote over there. How would you make sure addressing climate change is a global priority? Because this presidents obviously walked away from what’s going on.
Yep.
That’s right.
Well, Al, one of the things you and I worked on, we served in the Senate was arms control and nuclear proliferation. One of the things that I would do, and again, I’m not being solicitous when I say this, but hopefully if I get elected with your help, is I would call within a hundred days of being… At first, I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and I’d hold there. And secondly, I would make sure that we end up in a situation where we become, we call, the major polluters in the world to a meeting in Washington, DC immediately, within the first 100 days, just like we did on dealing with nuclear proliferation. And directly engage these leaders in a major carbon emitting nations that to persuade them to have to make them bigger. One section of that agreement says that after five years, we’re going to take a look and see when we have to up the ante on the commitments we’ve all made.
And so we have to up the ante now. And there’s a lot of major polluters out there now that we walked away. Donald Trump talks about America first. He’s made America alone. We used to lead by example. And by passing a climate plan and the targets and mechanisms in this to make sure we hold other people accountable to the standard we have, one thing you would have done if you had been president a long time ago. But look what’s happening now. We have a circumstance where the Chinese have their Belt and Road Initiative, but they’re outsourcing pollution all over the world. Coal, more coal. And they’re saying, “We’re not doing it at home.” Right? That doesn’t work. But flip it another way. Look what’s going on in Brazil. I’ve been there a bunch.
You have, too. The entire… They’re burning the Amazon. Why? Because they need agricultural space, they want to grow, et cetera. And when I’ve talked to them in the past, they say, “You guys did it. Why can’t we do it?” Well, one of the things you were one of the leaders on, along with a couple other people, Dick Lugar and others, remember we passed that bill saying, “We’re going to forgive debt for forest.” If you in fact don’t cut down your forest, we’ll forgive the debt. Well, if you were president or I were president, or Barack was still president, what he’d be doing is he’d be calling the president of Brazil, organizing the rest of the world and say, “We’re going to give you $20 billion to stop burning it. Stop burning.” And if you do that, you can find other avenues to grow your economy because that’s the largest carbon sink in the world.
As you’ve pointed out before, and I don’t know all the facts, all the numbers as well as you would, my recollection is more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere in the Amazon locked into the ground than all the carbon emitted, the pollution emitted in the United States on a daily basis. It’s a gigantic carbon sink. It absorbs, it does more to help the environment than if we stopped every single bit of carbon going in the air. And look what’s happening. We’re not organizing. If we don’t organize the world, who organizes it? And so there’s so much I think… Anyway, look. One more question here. Is it too late to aggress the climate change in a meaningful way? By that I mean, can we still make the kind of impact in time to save the environment and to make sure that our kids and our grandkids and our great grandkids are going to see blue skies, breathe clean air, and in fact be in a situation that is fundamentally different than the direction it’s going now?
I really appreciated it. You have you been a great friend for many years and look how far you brought us along. This is the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which helped launch the entire environmental movement and fundamentally changed this country, made our air and water a little bit cleaner.
We got so much more to do though. We still have such a long way to go but today, most Americans now get the challenge we’re facing. They believe in science. The issue is important to them and they want their leaders to act on climate, particularly young people, as you said, inspired by the activism of Greta and so many young Americans as well, who are leading on climate.
You know, JFK said refused to postpone. You know that one line in his speech we all had to learn when we were kids about going to the moon and he talked about the one thing that the line that meant the most to manage to drive our colleagues crazy was his phrase, I refuse. We’re doing this because we refused to postpone. Well, we should say as a nation, I refuse to postpone. As president, I refuse to postpone taking immediate action. And look, I’m confident. I’m confident. Not only can we address the crisis, we can make most of the opportunity and create 10 million good jobs, make the US the world’s clean energy exporter and more optimistic than I have been since I’ve been a 29 year old kid about what we can do.
The last question I asked you about are the things that we’re going to be able to restore everything what it was before. The answer is not everything but we can go a long way. That’s why we have to build to what reality is today, not get worse. America, there’s not a single thing we’ve been unable to do. Al, as you pointed out, not a single thing we’re not able to do as a nation. We’ve done it together.
So I want to thank you Al, for joining me today. Your support means a great deal to me. Your lifelong leadership in this issue in so many others has made a great deal to… You’re known around the world and people, when they talk about the future of the planet, they talk about you. I appreciate your taking the time and this important discussion and I look forward to being able to work with you because Al, you’ve like I said, you have turned Earth Day into a movement that is taking hard, concrete, specific action, not just here but worldwide. I think we can do this, Al. I think it should be an exciting time for our grandchildren. An exciting time.
You’re kidding. I didn’t know it was that young.
Thanks an awful lot, Al. Look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Jonathan Edwards,United Kingdom,2019-03-15,"Before I explain my party’s position, I would like to add my voice to those who have been calling for the House of Commons to have a full portfolio of votes on the various options. On 15 January, I wrote an article for The Huffington Post making the case for using a voting system designed to create a majority. I was delighted to see the Father of the House bring forward an amendment to that effect a few weeks ago.​
The key question that will face us after this evening if we support an extension to article 50 will be this: for what purpose? Without finding a purpose for the extension, we still face the prospect of no deal by default. The publication of the Government’s tariff proposals gave us a good idea of what that would mean. It would be a disaster for Welsh agriculture, in particular, because if we set very high import tariffs, that would be reciprocated in terms of exports. Half of all Welsh lamb goes to the European Union, and that sector would be decimated. In keeping an open border between the Republic of Ireland and the north of Ireland, the British Government signalled their intention to sink the ports of my country.
That would help to deal with the backstop. Although I do not share the concerns of hon. Members in relation to the backstop, that issue would be dealt with by our suggestion. It would deal with the problems of a blind Brexit. It would deal with the problem of no deal. It would encourage a more sensible approach to other trade negotiations. There is something for everybody in our suggestion, apart from those who seem obsessed with leaving on 29 March.
I say to Labour colleagues that the right moment does not always come in politics—there is only the moment, and the moment is now.

Donald Trump,United States of America,2017-04-25,"Busy day. They had a very busy day -- had a good day. We're doing well, very well. Things are turning around. I know they're turning around for you folks, so I just want to welcome you very much to the White House -- special place -- America's farmers and ranchers. And it was a beautiful ceremony, and were going to celebrate a little bit later, and that's great. Were very happy. And you had a good vote too.
You didn't have one of those 51-49 votes. We appreciate it.
Today, America's farmers feed not only our nation, but millions of people around the world, and were going to open that up much more for you folks because, as you know, it's not totally open, to put it mildly. We learned that yesterday, frankly, with Canada, where the dairy farmers up in Wisconsin, Upstate New York, different places -- a lot of border states in particular -- are not able to sell their dairy products into Canada. And this has been going on for a while, and were not going to put up with it.
And separately, we put a very big tax -- we will be putting a very big tariff on lumber -- timber -- coming into this country. People don't realize Canada has been very rough on the United States. Everyone thinks of Canada as being wonderful, and so do I. I love Canada. But they've outsmarted our politicians for many years, and you people understand that. So we did institute a very big tariff; we announced it yesterday. And were going to take care of our dairy farmers in Wisconsin, and Upstate New York, and lots of other places. So I think you people all probably agree with that, right? Would you agree with that? You better believe it.
Our farmers deserve a government that serves their interest and empowers them to do the hard work that they love to do so much. And that's what todays executive order is all about. With this order, I'm directing Secretary Perdue to work with other members of my Cabinet to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulations that hurt our nations farmers and rural communities.
Now, Sonny, I've already signed a lot of regulations and terminations that really help the farmer a lot. You know what I'm talking about. But we have some left, and you'll identify them. But wave really gotten rid of some of the biggest ones. And that was a big help, right? I mean, they won't tell you about it, but they're big numbers, and it's going to mean a lot to the farmers.
This order also establishes the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity, to be led by Secretary Perdue. I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you because, among many other things, with this order, we continue a very relentless effort to make life better for hardworking Americans, and that includes the farmers and all of the people gathered around this table, including our ranchers, our rural community folks. We're having a very, very big impact.
Its already started. Sonny is going to now identify additional areas where we can get rid of unnecessary regulations, and you people are going to be so prosperous, and you're going to hire so many more people than currently work for you, and that's going to make me very happy, okay?
So I want to thank you very much. So do we have the executive order, please? So this is promoting agriculture and rural prosperity in America. And, now, there's a lot of words I won't bother reading everything. But agriculture and rural prosperity in America, that's what we want. And we don't want to be taken advantage of by other countries -- and that's stopping, and that's stopping fast. Okay, thank you. What do you think.
No, not at all.
They have a tremendous surplus with the United States. Whenever they have a surplus, I have no fear. By the way, virtually every country has a surplus with the United States. We have massive trade deficits. So when were the country with the deficits, we have no fear.
Say it?
The wall is going to get built, by the way. Just in case anybody has any question: The wall is going to get built, and the wall is going to stop drugs, and it's going to stop a lot of people from coming in that shouldn't be here, and it's going to have a huge effect on human trafficking, which is a tremendous problem in this world -- a problem that nobody talks about -- but it's a problem that's probably worse than any time in the history of this world. Human trafficking, what's going on.
The wall is going to get built, and were setting record numbers in terms of stopping people from coming in, and stopping drugs from coming in. You see the numbers down 73, 74 percent. I will say, Secretary Kelly -- formerly General Kelly -- is doing an incredible job. And I was just with him a little while ago, and he said we definitely, desperately need the wall. And were going to have the wall built. I mean, I don't know why people are talking. I watch these shows, and the pundits in the morning -- they don't know what they're talking about. The wall gets built -- 100 percent. Thank you very much.
Soon. Were already preparing. We're doing plans. We're doing specifications. We're doing a lot of work on the wall, and the wall gets built. The wall is very, very important.
Well, it's certainly going to -- yeah, yeah, sure.
We have plenty of time -- got a lot of time. Thank you.

John Redwood,United Kingdom,2019-01-04,"The Wokingham constituency now comprises the three large and important settlements of Wokingham town, Woodley and Earley, where recently has been constructed one of the largest new private housing developments anywhere in Europe. To the north of those three big settlements lie the delightful villages of Twyford, Ruscombe, the Remenham, Wargrave, Sonning and some of the other smaller settlements. To the south lie the villages of Winnersh and northern Crowthorne, the village I share with my hon.
The main problem we face is the tremendous success of the enterprise economy in the Thames valley. The pace of growth and development has been such that it begins to produce strains on roads, hospitals and education facilities. I should like to say how much I welcome the initiative to be launched by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services to cut the waiting lists. I remind him that high growth areas of the country need that additional resource to take care of population growth as well as the advance in medical treatments, which we all welcome.
In the Wokingham constituency we also experience the problems that the area of the Thames valley to the east of Reading into London is now really a unified labour market where wages are high and where there are many attractive job offers available. Whereas places a little further east than my constituency enjoy the benefits of London weighting or outer London allowances for housing and for the competitive forces in the labour market, Wokingham has no such luxury. I urge the Government to look carefully at the possibility not of introducing complete regional pay, but of re-examining the geographical confines of London weighting and outer London weighting and also the amounts involved because we have difficulties in recruiting people of the right skills. If we can find them in other parts of the country, we have problems in housing them because of the high cost of housing.
Above all, the success of embracing an enterprise culture and the success of the Government in lowering taxes and getting growth and prosperity running again in so many parts of the country is more than relevant to those hon. Members representing inner urban constituencies that still suffer dereliction or poverty. There is common ground between us, because many of us representing vast growing areas would dearly love to see some element of that growth passing instead to those inner city areas where there is already public infrastructure and the need for more jobs and development. Therefore, we particularly welcome the Government’s concentration in the Queen’s Speech on setting forth a series of bold measures to tackle the problem of inner city decay.
It cannot be right that there are people in council blocks, tower blocks or medium rise blocks without hope of an improvement in their housing conditions. It cannot be right that there are acres near the heart of Manchester, Newcastle or in some of the less advantaged London boroughs crying out for commercial or industrial development that, for some reason or another, has been blocked when opportunities have arisen to return prosperity to those once great city areas.
The Government are right to put forward two particular proposals. The first is to give tenants the right to choose different styles of housing and to set up tenants’ co-operatives. That should improve the lot of those in inner city housing. It is also right that urban development corporations should take on the task of rebuilding and restructuring industry and commerce by facilitating the massive influx of private capital that those derelict areas so clearly need.
I hope that hon. Members believe in the United Kingdom and understand that the debate in the House is to try to better conditions in all towns, villages, regions and nations within the United Kingdom. I hope that hon. Members will accept that there are many of us on the Government side of the House who, with good will, say that we wish to see those areas of poverty and dereliction cleared and improved. We invite Labour Members to study the reasons why the south-east is so prosperous and why it has embraced the enterprise economy with such success. I hope that they will ask whether, together with some public money and a lot of private initiative, we can kindle exactly the same kind of success in those inner city areas where the prosperity has not yet reached.
",1987 Maiden Speech in the House of Commons,http://www.ukpol.co.uk/john-redwood-1987-maiden-speech-in-the-house-of-commons/
Justin Trudeau,Canada,2018-04-15,"Good afternoon. Thank you all for coming.
There are times in the life of a country when we come together in common purpose, for the good of the country.
This is one of those times.
For months now, we have worked hard with the governments of British Columbia and Alberta to help them chart a path forward together on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.
Our discussion today was the culmination of many meetings, many discussions, and I’m certain we will have many more in the days and weeks ahead.
The time we have taken in this process was necessary. That’s democracy. We knew from day one that the only way to get this built was by consulting and engaging, and listening to folks.
Canada has completed the deepest consultations with rights holders ever on a major project in this country. And working with our indigenous partners has been paramount. To date, 43 First Nations have negotiated benefit agreements with the project – 33 of those in B.C.
Throughout, the Government of Canada’s objective has been clear: To develop the vital infrastructure that is critical to our ability to get Canadian resources to global markets; and to do this while protecting our environment, which includes safeguarding our oceans and combatting climate change.
Fundamental to this strategy is the truth that protecting our environment and growing our economy are not opposing values. On the contrary, each makes the other possible.
We’ve put in place the most rigorous set of environmental standards, ocean protection and coastline protection in the world. And we’re not done. We know we can always do better, and we will.
That sense of optimism, of hope, of ambition to leave the world a better place than we found it, is who we are as Canadians.
But as I said when I first described this strategy to the Calgary Petroleum Club, five years ago: Hope alone is not enough. A relentless work ethic is needed. Pragmatism is needed. And compromise is needed.
At the end of the day, no matter the province, territory, city or town we call home, all Canadians love this country. And we are there for each other in times of need.
The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is a vital strategic interest to Canada. It will be built.
What does that mean, to say it’s a vital strategic interest to Canada?
It means hundreds of thousands of Canadians who work long hours every day to put food on their table, and to build this country, depend on this project getting built.
It means people in the oil patch are hurting, have been hurting for years, and we stand with them, just as we stand with forestry workers in B.C. , aerospace workers in Quebec and auto workers in Ontario.
It means the job of the pipefitter in Fort Mac matters as much as that of the aluminum worker in Alma, the forestry worker in Prince Rupert, the auto worker in Windsor or the fisherman in St. John’s.
It means every single Canadian’s family and future and dreams, matter.
It means the billions in public funds, for health care, for infrastructure, for the environment, now being lost to the discount on Canadian heavy crude, because we can’t get our product to new markets, is not something we can accept as a permanent anchor on our national prospects.
And it means that, even as we continue to work hard with Premiers Notley and Horgan to find solutions, we must recognize that they remain at an impasse, which only the Government of Canada has the capacity and authority to resolve.
The B.C. government’s efforts to block this project have obviously inflamed passions and political rhetoric in both provinces, and across the country. I want to encourage leaders of all stripes to keep one thing in mind as we go forward:
BCers and Albertans are not opponents. They are neighbours. They are fellow countrymen and women, who want the best for themselves and each other.
Every day millions of Canadians in both provinces work together, play together, build communities and a great country together.
BCers don’t want to block Alberta’s resources. They want to know that the coast is protected. For too long it wasn’t, and now it will be. The Oceans Protection Plan makes sure of that.
Albertans care as much about Canada’s natural beauty as anyone. Spend some time camping or hiking around Kananaskis Country and talk to people. You won’t find more passionate defenders of conservation and the environment. They wouldn’t dream of putting it in jeopardy.
We are a vast, varied cooperative federation, built on centuries of compromise. But we are, above all, one country governed by our Constitution and by the rule of law.
As such, I have instructed the Minister of Finance to initiate formal financial discussions with Kinder Morgan, the result of which will be to remove the uncertainty overhanging the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.
We will not have these discussions in public. But construction will go ahead.
I have also informed Premiers Notley and Horgan today that we are actively pursuing legislative options that will assert and reinforce the Government of Canada’s jurisdiction in this matter, which we know we clearly have.
Canada is a country defined by hope and hard work. Hope that a better community, a better future, a better country, are always possible. And hard work to make it happen.
So to make that dream a reality, Canadians need and expect an honest, open federal government that works with all sides to solve big problems in the national interest.
This is both our constitutional right, and our responsibility. We assert that right, and we embrace that responsibility.
A little over a week ago, I got the chance to spend an hour or so in the lunch room of the new, state of the art Suncor facility in Fort McMurray. The first thing that strikes you when you talk to people in Fort Mac is that they’re from everywhere. Every province and territory. Big cities and small towns from North Sydney to Campbell River, and all parts in between.
The work these Canadians do together creates jobs and feeds families everywhere. It is with them in mind that we assert the Government of Canada’s constitutional authority to complete this vital project.
We are going through a time of great change, here in Canada and around the world. Climate change, income inequality, the rise of extreme politics of both the right and left. These are all forces with the potential to pull us apart.
We will weather these changes. And we will come through them even stronger.
We’ll do this the way Canadians always do when we are tested: by pulling together.
Now I am happy to take your questions.
